But Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University charges that the ''fund is unqualified to assume its new tasks.''

''Its structure harks back to its founding 50 years ago and ill serves today's needs,'' he said.
And even if the I.M.F.
has the will, it no longer has the way to impose its views.
Almost everyone agrees that it cannot perform its current mission with the sums -- now down to well under $100 billion by any accounting -- left in its coffers.
Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that ''the fund may need another $200 billion just to bail out Brazil without imposing a severe recession.''
So the I.M.F.
needs to change.
But how?
Economists have produced a number of answers.
Some call for expanding the I.M.F.
's powers to aid crippled economies, perhaps by turning it into a true ''lender of last resort'' that disburses money to prop up countries in financial distress.
Others would expand its mission by having it insure foreign loans.
Yet another group would take the opposite tack, trimming the role of the institution.
They would offer bailouts to fewer countries, or focus the fund's efforts on convening negotiations between debtor countries and their creditors.
But much of the disagreement flows from one deep-seated dispute -- whether a territory as small as Hong Kong or a country as large as Brazil should fix their currencies in terms of dollars or let them float according to the vagaries of the market.
If the members of the I.M.F.
could settle the issue of exchange rates, many of the other policy issues would fall quietly into line.
Countries adopt a fixed exchange rate -- a pledge to convert currencies into dollars at a preset rate -- in part to reassure investors that their money is safe.
But fixed rates get countries into financial trouble when, for whatever reason, investors get spooked and all rush for the exits at the same time.
With trillions of dollars sloshing around world capital markets, the dollar reserves of nearly every country can be decimated in days, if not seconds.
Russia, like some other countries, brought disaster on itself by printing too many rubles.
The more ominous lesson of the last few years is that fickle investors can also rock countries that conduct prudent policies.
Mr. Krugman worries that it takes ''a minority of skittish investors to set off a self-justifying run on the country's reserves.''
The upshot is that countries that pledge to preserve fixed rates at any cost are sometimes forced to do exactly that: Sweden in 1993, Brazil today and scores of other countries whose currencies have come under attack have been forced to jack up domestic interest rates to 40, 50 or 100 percent or more to convince investors to stay.
High rates can stop the outflow of dollars, but they also crush the domestic economy.
Indeed, the fund is criticized for strangling the economies of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand last year by needlessly insisting they impose sky-high interest rates as part of their fund-approved packages.
Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, argues that fixed rates do not work well with unlimited capital flows.
His answer is to let currencies float.
''The mistake was holding onto the fixed rates.
They become a trap if kept longer than necessary, say 18 months or so.''

By proposing that countries move to freely floating rates, Mr. Sachs hopes to minimize the possibility of sudden currency collapses.
He would urge the fund to help countries whose currencies are under attack, but only after the currency is set free.
The money would be used to mitigate the impact of devaluation on the poor and to reassure investors that the country's finances would be sound and its currency unlikely to plunge much further.
Mr. Sachs also urges the fund to focus less on bailing out debtor countries than on helping them negotiate relief from their creditors.
When a debtor cannot repay loans in the United States, the courts step in and suspend payments until a settlement that is fair to all creditors can emerge.
Mr. Sachs wants a similar procedure internationally.

''So while international debt negotiations lack the legal protections to work in theory,'' Mr. Sachs said, ''they somehow manage to work in practice.''
Mr. Meltzer starts from the same presumption as Mr. Sachs -- that fixed rates do not work well in a world of vast capital flows -- but comes to a different conclusion.
He wants to minimize the role of the fund, whose bailouts, he argues, have done a lot of harm.
His solution is to turn the fund into a limited lender of last resort, lending money to debtor countries for a fee.
But debtors would have to post ample collateral.
That leaves Mr. Meltzer vulnerable to the charge that his plan would bail out only countries that do not need the fund's help.
And in a sense, he agrees: Classic economic thinking suggests bailing out only those borrowers who are merely illiquid, simply lacking ready cash to pay back creditors while holding ample assets, but not those who are insolvent, without enough assets to cover their debts.
But many economists, and these include key policy makers like Stanley Fischer, the fund's No.
2 official, regard floating rates as unacceptably risky for developing countries.
Fickle investors, controlling trillions of dollars, can drive currency values up and down in huge swings for seemingly no valid economic reason.
Sudden currency swings play havoc with people's lives.
Depreciation can decimate industries that rely on imported parts, turning once secure jobs into rubble.
In Asia, steep currency declines sent the price of imports skyrocketing, impoverishing millions last year.
That threatens many banks throughout Asia and Latin America.
''It is no accident,'' Mr. Fischer said, ''that countries turn to fixed rates to bring order to their economies.''

Economists who tie themselves to fixed rates also tie themselves to the I.M.F.
The world simply needs some institution to lend money to countries whose reserves are temporarily under attack, they say.
That is why Mr. Bergsten, who advocates rates that are flexible only enough to float within a preset range, argues for making the fund work better within its existing role.
He would have the fund scrutinize pertinent financial data of its member nations and intervene early before they run into problems.
As part of his ''I.M.F.
plus'' proposal, he would also require the fund to eliminate the worst feature of its Mexican and Asian bailouts.
Under those programs, Western creditors were hardly nicked, encouraging them to take imprudent risks elsewhere.
The most direct way to correct this ''moral hazard'' is for the fund to pressure creditors to offer significant debt relief.
George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has a more ambitious plan.
''International capital movements need to be supervised and the allocation of credit regulated by an international authority,'' he argues.
Mr. Soros proposes, as yet without detail, that a new spin-off of the I.M.F.
calm jittery foreign investors by ''guaranteeing international loans for a modest fee'' up to a limit.
The guarantees would be backed by special drawing rights that, in effect, use American dollars -- together with backing from other major countries -- perhaps without explicit Congressional permission.
Even if Mr. Soros's proposal could overcome political objections on Capitol Hill, there are still practical challenges to the idea.
Loan insurance encourages investors to ignore the creditworthiness of borrowers, which is why it is limited in the United States to relatively small deposits in commercial banks and savings and loans.
His proposal may invite reckless investing.
There are also proposals, most recently by Jeffrey Garten, a former Commerce Department official, to turn the fund or some other institution into a global central bank able to issue money whenever the international economy sags.
But economists point out that his bank would require gargantuan resources and the legal power to intervene in the economies of member countries.
There will be lots of talk of reform this week when the I.M.F.
and World Bank hold their semiannual meetings.
Even if there is as yet no consensus for radical overhaul, the fund's survival may depend on its ability to borrow at least some of what its critics propose.
Yesterday, the day after the Federal Reserve cut its short-term interest rate target one-quarter point in an effort to prevent the financial crisis abroad from derailing the American economy, all the news seemed to point to things getting worse, not better.

More companies offered warnings that their earnings would come in below forecasts, adding to the gloom that has analysts predicting that earnings will decline in the third quarter for the first time since the fourth quarter of 1991.
While the fund denied the rumor, the fact that such rumors spread so easily these days is a sign of negative investor sentiment.
The rumor helped drag down shares of banks and brokerage firms, which have been among the hardest hit in the stock market decline since mid-July.
And even the news of declining interest rates was not all that positive.
''The current rally is based on growing expectations of negative economic developments,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company.
Robert V. DiClemente, the chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney, added, ''This is not the way we would have liked bonds to go through 5 percent.''
In addition, while lower interest rates will help home buyers and consumers, the downward rush in Government yields has left the rates on other debt, like that of corporations, much higher as investors have chosen the safety of Government-backed bonds over even those of companies with good credit ratings.
As the Fed cuts interest rates, he said, ''there is no assurance that financial conditions will be easier.''
The drop in interest rates was apparently a key contributor to the losses at Long-Term Capital, meaning that further declines could mean harder times for it and other hedge funds that bet that Treasury yields would not fall this far this fast.

It is also probably contributing to losses for many Wall Street firms for the same reason.
While the decline in Treasury rates may be hurting firms on Wall Street, many analysts say the Fed did not cut rates enough on Wednesday to send a reassuring signal to other countries that the American economy will continue to grow and be a market for their exports.
''I think this is a time when you have to take pre-emptive action,'' said Nicholas P. Sargen, the global market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients.
In his view, it is clear that the global economic crisis is now impinging enough on the American economy to offset any inflationary threat from an interest rate cut that encourages growth.
The price on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, jumped 1 29/32, to 108 4/32.
The yield of 4.97 percent was down from 5.09 percent on Tuesday and is off three-quarters of a percentage point since the Dow hits its peak on July 17.
The yield on the 10-year note, which is a benchmark for home mortgages, dropped to 4.41 percent, from 4.56 percent on Tuesday, its lowest since the end of 1965.
''When you see bond prices go up this much and stock prices go down this much, the message is clear,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
''Investors are becoming much more worried about the economy and earnings than they had been.''
In addition, there were signals from Europe that earnings are under pressure there.
According to I.B.E.S.
International, which monitors analysts' earnings forecasts, profits for the companies in the S.& P. 500 will fall by 2.2 percent in the third quarter.

Early today, the Nikkei plunged at the opening to below 13,000, nearly a 13-year low, before recovering to end the morning session little changed.
''It's sort of a referendum on the fact that the crisis keeps smoldering and no one has confidence that anybody's going to extinguish it,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis.
Stocks of financial institutions in the United States, exposed to turmoil in emerging markets, write-offs of hedge fund losses and other domestic debt as well as the possibility of recession, took some of the heaviest battering.

and World Bank is to begin this weekend in Washington, but some analysts were skeptical that effective action would, or even could, be taken to restore confidence in arresting the downward economic and financial spiral.

''Worldwide events have superseded what the I.M.F.
can handle,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities.
''The economy's not falling out of bed,'' he said, even though growth in the United States would not be much faster than a 2 percent annual pace in the quarter that ended Wednesday and perhaps as little as 1 percent in the year's final quarter.
At a Congressional inquiry into hedge funds, one source of current instability, Mr. Greenspan resisted suggestions for tight regulation, saying that such moves might be counterproductive by driving those operations abroad.
Merrill Lynch was one of the many prominent casualties among financial stocks, sliding 3 3/16 a share, to 44, after trading as low as 42 9/16 during the day -- down from a high of 109 1/8 on July 13.
''You have a flight to stability and stocks with good dividends,'' said Daniel B. Eagan, a portfolio manager at Black Rock in Philadelphia.
Here in North Carolina's Fourth Congressional District, Mr. Price, acknowledging that his own polls showed him in a tight race, said: ''This is a swing district that is sensitive to any tide or trend.

The efforts of Mr. Price and Mrs. Carson to contain the Lewinsky debacle -- and their opponents' attempts to capitalize on it -- offer important clues suggesting how President Clinton's problems are influencing the conduct of races around the country.
Many Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to appear close to a President whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing the possibility of a public backlash against Republicans, they are weighing their words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon.
And while these Democrats publicly express confidence that the scandal will have little impact on them, their campaigns are preparing for the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-scenes efforts to prod their core constituencies to vote.
In a reflection of the uncertainty that the Clinton scandal has cast even among Republicans, the challengers in the Price and Carson districts -- both are political novices seeking office for the first time -- have differing strategies:
Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Mr. Price, has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal.
''Tom Roberg has called for Bill Clinton's resignation,'' the narrator says.
''This is not the time to be silent, Mr. Price.
Where do you stand?''
But in Indianapolis, Gary A. Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking a more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he notes as often as he can that ''Julia votes with Clinton almost 100 percent of the time.''
Asked why he was not much raising the scandal directly, Mr. Hofmeister said: ''Don't murder somebody when they're in the process of committing suicide.
There would be a danger if we went overboard.''
The best evidence of the discomfort of both Mr. Price and Mrs. Carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they would want Mr. Clinton to campaign in their districts, both said it would be impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a visit.
''Given the President's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me,'' Mrs. Carson said.
And Mr. Price?
''I don't think that would be such a good idea,'' he said.
''I've never had a President campaign here, and I wouldn't want to start this time'' (although he is welcoming Erskine B. Bowles, the President's chief of staff and a popular native son in North Carolina, to stump with him on Sunday).

Making strategy for the stump is further complicated by anecdotal evidence that runs counter to Democratic fears and Republican hopes.
In three days of campaign stops in Indianapolis and here in North Carolina, the scandal was rarely raised by any voter being courted by the candidates of either party.
''It shouldn't have gotten this far.''

''There has to be rule of law,'' he said.
Mrs. Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing voters alike would become so fed up with the Lewinsky inquiry that the issue might even help her.
To that end, she proudly informs audiences that she voted against making public the report delivered to the House by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
The Carson campaign is counting on voters like Timothy D. Daly, a 38-year-old real estate executive who voted for a Republican two years ago but now favors Mrs. Carson.
''I'm pulling the Democratic ticket because I'm tired of it: the right side of the Republican Party is playing politics,'' Mr. Daly said.
''We'd like to see them go on with the people's business.''
Back here in the Fourth District, Mr. Price has some reasons to be worried.
In addition, the district was redrawn last year to include a large Durham section, where voters do not know him well.
Determined not to be a midterm casualty of Mr. Clinton once again, Mr. Price says he is waging the most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign of his career.

Rather than engage Mr. Roberg over the Clinton scandal, Mr. Price has begun broadcasting a television commercial that emphasizes his central issue: education.
The Congressman's advisers say they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly nonpolitical -- it features schoolchildren in a play -- in an effort to break through the television clutter about the scandal.
But the Price campaign also has a weapon it is holding in reserve, in the event Mr. Roberg appears to be riding the Clinton scandal to advantage: the incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid about running commercials underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting his doctorate in political science.
At a coffee with voters in a wealthy enclave of Raleigh the other night, Mr. Roberg opened by asserting that Mr. Clinton had ''lost the moral authority to lead.''
''I don't know how it's going to play,'' he said.
''People are tired of hearing this story, to a certain extent.''
Mr. Price seems just as uncertain.
''I know the other one is calling for the resignation of the President,'' Ms. Scott said, ''and that's a big one for me right now.''
It will mean stretching, Mrs. Farrell said.
''We won't be able to put as much aside into our retirement account as we have been, there won't be as many dinners out and we'll be keeping things to a minimum for at least a year,'' she said.
''But it puts us into the size house that we would like to be in.''

Similar buying and selling decisions have been stoking the market despite the rise in house prices in the last year.
Nevertheless, said Joseph E. Mottola, chief executive of the Long Island Board of Realtors, ''I'm not getting any kind of sense that affordability is an issue -- people are not complaining about what they have to pay.''
He attributed that to ''favorable interest rates, the availability of a variety of financing programs to fit everybody's needs and a general business optimism about being employed and doing well.''
Andrew Thaw, a partner of Whitman Thaw and Associates, mortgage bankers in Melville, and the president of the New York Society of Mortgage Professionals, a trade group, noted that even if a house goes up $10,000, the monthly cost would be more than offset by a drop of one percentage point in interest rates, assuming a 10 percent down payment is made in both cases.
He explained that with a 10 percent down payment, a $150,000 house would require a $135,000 mortgage that at 8 percent interest over 30 years would cost $990.58 a month.
A 10 percent down payment on a $160,000 house would require a $144,000 mortgage that at an interest rate of 7 percent would cost only $958.04 a month.
The State of New York Mortgage Agency has programs that allow first-time buyers to finance 100 percent of the cost of both a new and a resale house, said Joseph S. Rizzo, a mortgage representative for the Bank of New York Mortgage Company in Riverhead, which is a member of the housing partnership.
Family income can be $90,000 or more, depending on the number of family members, Mr. Rizzo said.
A point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount.

Still, rising prices have forced many buyers to scale back on their dream house, compromising either on neighborhood or size.
An example of how prices have gone up in a year is a house she listed a year ago for $225,000 in Williston Park, said Evelyn Atanas, a Williston Park broker.
Neal and Anne Ressa, who are first-time buyers, started looking for a house a year ago before settling on one in Mineola, which they found through Atanas Realty.

Mrs. Ressa works for a department store as a personal shopper.
But in Port Washington, they would have had to pay at least $250,000 for a smaller house, he explained.
Brokers, especially those in Nassau, report there is very little left even in the $200,000 range.
''I have buyers come in saying, 'I can spend up to $200,000,' which is an incredible amount of money especially if you're a young couple just starting out,'' said Renee Luft, a sales agent with the Century 21 Prevete real estate agency in Hicksville.
''But for $200,000, you don't get very much anymore.''
Even so, brokers say that buyers today are very knowledgeable and are not inclined to overpay.
''Even in today's hot market, pricing is crucial,'' said Katy Anastasio, owner of Anastasio Associates, a Huntington real estate broker.
New-house prices are rising along with those of resale houses.
Depending on the development, prices have risen $5,000 to $25,000 a house in the last year, said Marilyn Larsen of Great Neck, a marketing consultant to builders.
''And there has been no resistance,'' she added, noting that she is able to lock in today's low interest rates for nine months until a house is delivered.
Builders say they are forced to raise prices because they face rising costs.
''I don't raise prices frivolously,'' said Steven A. Klar, an East Meadow builder, ''but when we project out for a longer period of time, I anticipate cost increases in insulation and other materials, and I have to consider the cost of holding land.''

In his current development, Waterways at Moriches, he is building 274 units consisting of two-bedroom apartments and two-bedroom semiattached houses for people 55 or older.
The new prices range from $175,000 for an apartment to $250,000 for a semiattached house.
At the Villages at Huntington, where McGovern-Barbash Associates of Babylon is building 248 houses, prices, which started at $295,000 to $340,000 two years ago, have risen to $330,000 to $425,000.
The cost of materials and labor has also gone up, said Susan Barbash, one of the principals.
But buyers willing to move farther east into subdivisions just starting out can take advantage of preconstruction prices.
At a 72-house Yaphank development called Fairway Woods under construction by J. D. O. C. Construction of Yaphank, preconstruction prices range from $149,900 for a three-bedroom high ranch to $182,900 for a four-bedroom colonial.
But by Columbus Day, when models open, those prices will go up at least $5,000, said Mrs. Larsen of Great Neck, who is in charge of marketing.
Among her customers are John Jackson, a New York City police officer, and his wife, Nancy, an insurance claims representative.
They have contracted to buy the $182,900 colonial, having just sold their three-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot Ronkonkoma ranch for $148,500.
Because they hope to lock in a 6.625 percent interest mortgage, their new house will cost them only $150 a month more, including taxes, Mrs. Jackson said.
Will that mean a sharp price drop?

The mood instead runs from aloof, condemning cynicism to scathing anger.
The new templates of the genre are Patrick Marber's wildly acclaimed ''Closer,'' a brutal look at an internecine romantic quadrangle (headed for Broadway next year), and Mark Ravenhill's notorious ''Shopping and .
. ''
(seen in New York last season), works in which carnal knowledge, explicitly documented, is unsatisfying and unenlightening.
The hottest ticket in London is David Hare's ice-cold reworking of ''La Ronde,'' by Arthur Schnitzler.
This is the two-character show in which the movie star Nicole Kidman has made her London stage debut to delirious reviews, playing five women who look for love in all the wrong places, the point being that no place is the right place.
The single most unsettling, and representative, image to emerge from my 10 days of playgoing here comes from Mr. Ravenhill's latest offering, ''Handbag,'' in which a young woman is digitally brought to orgasm, by a man who might as well be a vibrator, while standing up and wearing a mask that suggests an extraterrestrial pig.
She is transformed by sex, for sure, but not into anything human.
Let's not forget that for centuries England has been dancing an uneasy waltz between tight-lipped puritanism (think Oliver Cromwell) and open-mouthed hedonism (think Christine Keeler), nor that the sort of sexual shenanigans now tainting the American Presidency are nothing new to the British.
In living memory, the country has seen a government unseated and its monarchy threatened by such activities.
Both phenomena are currently represented on the boards with the West End production of ''A Letter of Resignation,'' Hugh Whitemore's look at the Profumo scandal of the 1960's, and the delectably silly and oddly affecting ''Love Upon the Throne'' (written by Patrick Barlow and performed by Mr. Barlow and John Ramm, the entire company of the self-styled National Theater of Brent), in which two middle-aged, bespectacled men in business suits awkwardly enact the troubled courtship and marriage of Prince Charles and Lady Diana.
There's a genuine warmth to ''Throne,'' something notably absent from much of the rest of London's popular theatrical fare.
This doesn't mean, however, that audience and critical response to consciously chilly productions has been comparably detached.
The English clearly like to have their cake and drool over it, too.
Just consider the reviews garnered by Ms. Kidman in the Donmar Warehouse production of ''The Blue Room,'' staged by the omnipresent Sam Mendes, with Iain Glen (a classical actor who, surprisingly, tends toward cartoonishness here) playing the other halves of a series of erotically linked couples.
That Ms. Kidman gives an exceptionally proficient performance, nimbly shifting accents and embodying characters from a Cockney streetwalker to a self-dramatizing, self-adoring stage star, was duly noted by most critics.
The Evening Standard, which knows its priorities, wedged a brief critical appraisal of the play beneath a splashy assessment of Ms. Kidman's physique.

Well, maybe, if you're stimulated by the idea of copulation as a purely mechanical activity, something wittily emphasized here by the super titles that tabulate the time consumed by each sexual act.
The daisy chain of couplings in Mr. Hare's rather perfunctory modernization of Schnitzler's classic is a joyless cycle of users and the used, and it lacks the depths of passion and character that infuse the playwright's best works.
Unlike the original ''La Ronde,'' this adaptation gives off about as much Weltschmerz as the lurid neon lighting in which it is bathed.

Darkly Up to Date In 'Oklahoma!'
Audiences seeking to recover from the frostbite of ''The Blue Room'' might find it at the National Theater, the home of Trevor Nunn's triumphant revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Oklahoma!''
In this miraculously fresh-feeling production, which moves to the West End in January with (one prays) a Broadway engagement to follow, raging hormones may get people into trouble, but they are also a source of exuberant, unquenchable life.
This sensibility matches the robust, pioneer spirit of the show's world of farmers and cowboys.
The production has been restaged in ways that go beyond the usual respectful museum-piece revivals, with vital new choreography by Susan Stroman replacing the fabled dance numbers of Agnes de Mille.
Yet it comes closer than any version I've seen in creating a sense of how thrillingly novel the original production must have been.
Every song, even the chestnut of an opening number, ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin','' has a feeling of conversational spontaneity.
The show, populated with largely unknown but vigorously talented actors, seems propelled by young sexual urges uncertainly groping for an outlet, finding blissful release in dance.
The more troubled eroticism of the show is given appropriately shadowy life, most notably in Shuler Hensley's compellingly brutish Jud.
The threat of disruptive violence and the possibility of disappointments and losses to come are never far from the surface.
This acknowledgment of darkness only enhances the energy-charged light thrown off by the ensemble.
A similar exuberance could be found in the Globe Theater's brassy interpretation of ''A Mad World, My Masters,'' an early (1605) ribald comedy by Thomas Middleton.
The Globe has had a huge popular success, and this production makes it easy to see why.
The play, whose characters include a courtesan who has sold her virginity 15 times, is a reminder that a cynical take on sexual foibles is nothing new to the British theater and that such cynicism could also be fun.
Also on hand is a debauchee whose oxymoronic name speaks volumes about the English temperament: Penitent Brothel.
In the title role of the Almeida Theater's production of Racine's ''Phedre,'' directed by Jonathan Kent at the Albery Theater, Diana Rigg appears to be possessed by a succubus of some sort, and believe you me, she's not happy about it.
This fiercely intelligent actress creates a stinging portrait of a woman whose loins are directly at odds with her fine mind.
Desire is a cancer, and Ms. Rigg's contorted postures and bitter, enraged delivery suggest a pain as much physical as emotional.
Overall, the evening is too solemnly chic by half, with Maria Bjornson's elegant setting and costumes bringing to mind a fashion shoot by Horst.
Mr. Kent, who collaborated with Ms. Rigg on ''Medea,'' is not, to put it mildly, a relaxed director.
Here, he has his actors flattening themselves against the walls to express fear and sprinkling themselves with water in vain attempts to cool their characters' passions.

The approach verges on camp, particularly in Toby Stephens's tremulous, lip-biting performance as the unwilling object of Phedre's affection.
But Julian Glover is first-rate as Theseus, a strutting king whose bluster deflates into bewildered grief, and the blistering war against eroticism waged by Ms. Rigg's Phedre is unforgettable.
The contemporary characters in Mr. Ravenhill's ''Handbag,'' at the Lyric Studio in Hammersmith, don't put up much of a struggle against their carnal appetites.
This messy but intermittently powerful play juxtaposes two plots: the modern-day tale of two couples, one gay and one lesbian, who decide to rear a child together and a speculative version of the history of the misplaced baby in ''The Importance of Being Earnest.''
Neither the age of repression nor that of promiscuity makes good parents.
The people in Mr. Ravenhill's very bleak world are selfish creatures with short attention spans and muddled, conflicted notions of what it means to take care of someone else.
Directed by Nick Philippou, the production has the subtlety of a fire-and-brimstone revival meeting.
But the six-member cast brings a fearless, raw conviction to the evening, and unlike ''The Blue Room,'' ''Handbag'' locates the sharp pang of emptiness in its terminally dissatisfied characters.
Even in the midst of vividly simulated sexual acts, no one has a good time.
Royal Marriage A La Mode
The Prince and Princess of Wales, as incarnated in the ''Beyond the Fringe''-style antics of ''Love Upon the Throne,'' don't get much pleasure out of life, either.
England's most closely watched example of marital infidelity in recent years is rendered as a tale told by idiots, two bumblers of high aspirations and modest talent, named Desmond Oliver Dingle and Raymond Box (the alter egos of Mr. Barlow and Mr. Ramm).
But while they tend to get crucial details like the names of the royal family hilariously wrong, this hapless pair somehow gets the sad core of Charles and Diana's ill-starred relationship right.
Beneath the farcical high jinks, there's a current of wistfulness about one couple's inability to connect that taps into what made this royal marriage such a gripping and disturbing soap opera.
For the record, although a bed scene between Diana and one of her lovers is promised, it never actually takes place.
When Raymond Box learns the scene has been cut, he lets out a cyclonic sigh of relief.
DOLLAR FALLS AGAINST MARK.
The dollar declined for a sixth day on expectations the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates again.
Following are excerpts from statements today by President Clinton and the leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, at the two organizations' annual meeting:
By President Clinton
A half century ago, a visionary generation of leaders gathered at Bretton Woods to build a new economy to serve the citizens of every nation.
In one of his last messages to Congress, President Franklin Roosevelt said that the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and I quote, ''spell the difference between a world caught again in the maelstrom of panic and economic warfare or a world in which nations strive for a better life through mutual trust, cooperation and assistance.''
But now the health of Asia and indeed the world depends upon Japan.
Just as the United States had to eliminate its deficits and high interest rates, which were taking money away from the rest of the world, over the last six years, now Japan must take strong steps to restart its economic growth by addressing problems in the banking system so that lending and investment can begin with renewed energy and by stimulating, deregulating and opening its economy.
For all of us, there can be no substitute for action.
By Michel Camdessus, I.M.F.
It would be perhaps too dramatic yet to talk of global recession, but the evidence of the risks calls for immediate action.
Fortunately, in the industrial countries of North America and Europe the fundamentals remain sound.
For some time, inflation has been subdued.
Economic expansion continues in the United States, while in the economies of the euro area the recovery has continued to firm.
But even North America and Europe are not immune, and effects of the crisis are beginning to be felt.
If we expect any upturn next year, it will be because of the impressive steps by many countries, some of which were already implementing Fund-supported programs, to shield themselves against contagion.

An example at the onset of the crisis was the Philippines, which was able to absorb the worst of the successive waves of contagion by prolonging and rapidly strengthening an existing successful Fund-supported program.
The reaction of Latin American countries, so admirably illustrated by the remarks of President [Carlos Saul] Menem, is also to be lauded.
By jointly strengthening their defenses they have invited the markets to take greater account of the striking progress accomplished over the past decade and in particular since the Mexican crisis.
They have created the conditions for the Fund to negotiate promptly its financial support, if necessary.

East Asia -- where estimates suggest that more than 20 million people fell back into poverty last year, and where, at best, growth is likely to be halting and hesitant for several years to come.
Nuclear tests in India and Pakistan.
Terrorist bombs in Kenya and Tanzania.
We must address the issues of long-term equitable growth on which prosperity and human progress depend.
We must focus on the institutional and structural changes needed for recovery and sustainable development.
We must focus on the social issues.
We must do all this.
Because if we do not have the capacity to deal with social emergencies, if we do not have longer-term plans for solid institutions, if we do not have greater equity and social justice, there will be no political stability and without political stability no amount of money put together in financial packages will give us financial stability.
''There comes a time when you have to show that you don't accept what is going on,'' he said.
''The situation now is such that that time has come.''
Mr. Tyuterev does not begrudge the changes of the last years.
He and his wife, now on maternity leave with their 3-month-old baby, saved up enough one year to spend a month in India, the kind of private excursion that would have been impossible in Communist times.
And so he has no sympathy for the Communists, who together with the labor unions organized today's demonstrations.
''I do not want a Communist comeback,'' he said.
He is even ambivalent about calls for Mr. Yeltsin's resignation.
''Times change,'' he said.
''People change.
Our President has changed too.''
What he does want is a Government that will take charge and get the Russian economy working again.
But mainly, like many other Russians with a university degree and miserably paid jobs, Mr. Tyuterev is tired of being ignored.

''People are fed up with all this business,'' he said.
Like other Government workers, the forensic experts live on a fixed income -- although there is nothing fixed about a monthly salary of 1,200 rubles that did not materialize at all in September, which typically gets paid in dribs and drabs and which in dollar terms dropped from $200 to $80 after the ruble began its nose dive in August.

Mr. Tyuterev's family lives with his wife's parents, and even before the current crisis, neither he nor his wife could think of buying a car, let alone their own apartment, so the postponement of such dreams for them is no tragedy.
''In Russia, people who work for the Government are not middle-class, not by a long shot,'' said another colleague, Andrei Bobrov, 32, a ballistics expert and bachelor who lives with his mother, sister, brother-in-law and young nephew.
Mr. Bobrov has no time left for Mr. Yeltsin -- ''he is a clown'' -- and in the 1996 elections he voted first for Grigory A. Yavlinsky, leader of a liberal opposition party, and then in the second round ''against'' the Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov, Mr. Yeltsin's chief opponent.
But he still puzzles over the passivity of most Russians, who continue to put up with a miserly existence.
''A lot of people at the lab today were saying, 'Why go?'
''They all have their troubles, and they might come out and protest for themselves.
But they won't do it for the sake of groups that they think will use them for their own temporary political motives.''
Most central bankers are refusing to bend.

But the pressure is increasing.
In another sign of pressure, the Bank of England announced today that it would cut a key short-term interest rate by a quarter-point, to 7.25 percent.
For Britain, which has decided not to join the European currency union and follows a separate monetary policy, it was the first rate cut since June 1996.
In continental Europe, leaders are battling over fundamental economic policy.
With the Social Democrats' victory, Europe's biggest countries are or will soon be controlled by center-left governments.
A growing number of those governments now favor an easier monetary policy and would like to exert more political control over the European Central Bank.
Mr. Lafontaine has been an adamant critic of hawkish monetary policies.
Representing the Social Democrats' orthodox left wing, he has argued for years that such policies are the biggest culprits behind the nation's high unemployment.
French political leaders share those views.
the Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, has long advocated lower interest rates to spur job creation.
He has also bristled at the political independence given to the Bank of France and the new European Central Bank, calling for stronger political controls.
All of that runs counter to core principles of the European Central Bank and of individual national banks.
Because the euro will have its debut in January, the central banks of each member country have already locked their policies together into what amounts to a single framework.

By law, the new European Central Bank is allowed only to focus on the question of price stability and inflation.
Government leaders are not allowed to interfere or to influence any of its decisions.
''What we are seeing is indeed very significant,'' said Thomas Mayer, an economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt.
''We aren't used to having a government trying to influence monetary policy.
In the strategy of the new German Government, the role of monetary policy is obviously to spur economic growth and the creation of jobs.
That is obviously an approach that the central bankers of the European Central Bank do not share.''
Many economists argue that Europe is already following an expansionary monetary policy and does not need to change course.
Germany's basic short-term rate is 3.3 percent, and the average rate across the 11 countries in the ''euro zone'' is 3.7 percent -- significantly lower than in the United States, where rates are more than 5 percent.

Indeed, Mr. Tietmeyer and many private sector economists argue that Europe is already loosening monetary policy as it prepares for the euro.
That is because countries with traditionally high interest rates, like Spain and Italy, have to align their rates with those of Germany and France before the debut of the euro.
Until recently, most economists assumed that Germany would help close the gap by nudging its rates upward.
Instead, the central bankers appear determined to keep their rates low and let the other countries drop down to their level.
Despite the global financial turbulence, Dresdner Bank and many other institutions still predict that European economic growth will remain well above 2 percent next year and will exceed that of the United States.
That is because the United States is likely to be more affected by a slowdown in Latin America.
''The central bankers are confident that monetary policy in euroland is expansionary at the moment and will remain expansionary,'' said Stefan Bergheim, an economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt.
''We don't need to be lectured by central bankers who are running interest rates that are 20 percent higher than ours.''
Ah, excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt the fun Congress is having with its impeachment hearings and all.
But, well, there's just this little problem going on in the rest of the world.
It has to do with economics.
You see, the world's first truly global economy is going through its first truly serious global crisis.
If you follow the global credit crunch and market declines as they are displayed on graphs on a Bloomberg machine, they each look like an EKG tracking a massive heart attack.
So, you know, we might want to talk about it.
I mean, not all the time.
Maybe just in between the impeachment hearings and the release of the next Tripp tapes.
Like I said, I don't mean to interrupt ...
BUT HAVE WE GONE NUTS???
We are not just heading for lower growth, and possibly a recession.
We are seeing at minimum a slowdown and at a maximum a breakdown in the whole progression toward free-market capitalism.
That progression has enormously benefited Americans and millions of people in emerging markets, where $350 billion has been invested over the past decade.
Unfortunately, what is happening now is that those same investors are, without any distinctions between good and bad countries, pulling their money out in pursuit of lower and lower risks, putting all their money into T-bills or a mattress.
The net result is to choke off credit to everyone, from bad Russian banks to good Brazilian factories to promising American start-up companies, in a way that can only lead to misery and unemployment.
As the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, Robert Hormats, says, ''We have not seen a withdrawal of liquidity this big from the third world since the Good Lord parted the Red Sea to let the children of Israel walk through.''
Meanwhile, the Republican-led Congress is having a grand time, recklessly dragging out the impeachment of the President until Christmas -- and it's not even clear which Christmas.
This is not to say that because of this financial crisis we must ignore President Clinton's horrendous personal behavior.
But it is to say we've got to recognize that the global context that existed when this affair first erupted has fundamentally changed.
You may not know that from watching CNN or MSNBC, with their 24-hour-a-day impeach-a-tainment shows.
But it has.
And it has changed into a global crisis that requires enormous political leadership in general and U.S. leadership in particular.
It is time, therefore, to take Gerald Ford's advice and work out a censure plea bargain between Mr. Clinton, Kenneth Starr and Congress and be done with this affair -- now.

That is the sort of volatility you expect in the Mexican peso.
It just doesn't happen with the dollar.
It is like seeing a cat fly.
When panicked markets overshoot this badly, you have to overshoot them right back.
What is needed now are some holy-cow, in-your-face, stick-this-in-your-portfolio-and-smoke-it, confidence-building measures by the U.S., Europe and Japan to break the negative psychology of the markets and stoke up some real worldwide demand.
That requires, among other things, a U.S. President able to galvanize the process, explain it and press it forward.

It also requires a steep drop in the key interest rate by the Federal Reserve from the current level of 5.25 percent; an incremental drop won't do it.
And it may require using some of the budget surplus for a tax cut.
It also requires a cut in German-European interest rates.
And it certainly requires an emergency cleanup of the bankrupt Japanese banking system.
The real systemic threat to the global economy today is the continuing risk of large-scale bank failures in Japan.
This is not a test, folks.
If this credit crunch continues it will have enormously destabilizing effects.
Because on the one hand the world is telling developing countries to reform their economies, clean up their banks and get their financial software up to Western standards.
And on the other hand, it is telling them that they are going to have to do this with much, much less capital from the developed countries, or with much, much higher interest rates at home.
That is a prescription for political explosions all over the world.
The recent period of poor returns has brought to light flaws in the industry's practice of being all things to all people -- providing an endless variety of investment strategies, share classes and niche-filling funds.
By slicing the fund bologna so absurdly thin that it hardly serves as a snack, much less a nutritious meal, mutual fund companies, in many cases, have left people more confused than informed.

A scan of the list of funds that performed the best over the last 12 months, however, could impart a few basic facts -- and expose a few myths -- about investing.
And the lessons could serve investors well over the next year.
Some of the best performers over this period of market turmoil, for example, are funds that have the flexibility to add to or take away from asset classes like bonds or cash as the portfolio manager sees fit.
Those managers generally are not bound to stay fully invested all the time or to limit themselves to one type of stock, and thereby to take risks that few sensible investors would take on their own.
''A lot of people get caught up with exotic portfolio theory,'' said Scott W. Schoelzel, manager of the Janus Twenty fund, which, according to Morningstar, was the best-performing diversified stock fund over the last 12 months, gaining 32.5 percent.
''But I think I'm just like my shareholders.
I'm 40 years old, I'm saving for retirement and for my kids' college education, and I think about how would I do that if I were investing on my own and not running a fund.''
He does it by owning 20 or 30 stocks rather than 150, to better focus on his best ideas.
And Mr. Schoelzel lets cash build up to 20 percent or so of the portfolio when he cannot find attractive stocks to buy.
He prefers to wait until bargains crop up.
''To me it's a very common-sensical approach,'' Mr. Schoelzel said.
''The key is to have balance -- not to own stocks of just one particular sector, but to look at five or six areas that generally offer the most dynamic prospects for growth.''
Not surprisingly, investors have been throwing money at the Janus Twenty fund, even as they turned tail and ran away from stock funds as a whole in August.
In that regard, investors abandoned the mantra they have have chanted for the last three years -- ''Where else is there to put money than in stocks?''
The cloud hanging over the fund business represents a startling change from the environment at the end of the second quarter, when a fourth consecutive year of 20-plus percent gains seemed likely for equity investors.
Bond funds, too, had registered gains, averaging nearly 3.5 percent.
But by losing more than 13 percent of its value in the third quarter, the average American stock fund wiped out the previous two quarters of gains and then some.

For the last three years, with the markets marching steadily upwards, the industry trend had been to push fund managers into ever-narrower pigeonholes.
Fund companies increasingly cracked the asset-allocation whip, insisting that managers remain fully invested.
Yet the losses that many investors will face when they open their third-quarter statements later this month might have been smaller if fund managers had been given a bit more slack in how they managed their portfolios.
A fund manager who has some flexibility to decide when, as well as in which securities, to invest might give a fund shareholder a leg up in times of market upheaval.
''I'm happy to have some extra cash around,'' said Wallace R. Weitz, manager of the Weitz Value and Weitz Partners Value funds, which have had as much as one-quarter of their assets in cash this year.
Mr. Weitz knows of what he speaks.
He is the only manager with two of his equity funds among the top 10 performers over the last four quarters.
11.)
Mr. Weitz says he likes the spare cash ''because I always think that tomorrow I'll find a great idea.''
RESISTING the urge to pay too much for what are otherwise good companies and rigorously cutting back on holdings whose prices move up too far, too fast are two of the hardest disciplines for a portfolio manager to master.
And doing so is subverted in the current environment, as fund analysts and pension consultants demand that managers remain fully invested.
Enforcing that dogma probably hurt investors more than it helped them recently, because it has caused the amount of nonequity investments in most fund shareholders' portfolios to drift further and further down.
The amount of overall mutual fund assets in bonds has fallen over the last three-plus years to 17 percent of assets, from 31 percent at the beginning of 1995.
Over the same stretch, stocks have risen to 58 percent from 40 percent, while cash has remained relatively constant at about 25 percent of assets.
In the last few years, of course, fund companies have tried to help investors know what is in their portfolios.
But they have done so both by increasing their disclosure and by creating an enormous number of new, specialized funds, investing in specific niches.
Such specialization -- from Malaysian bonds to North American commercial real estate to stocks of companies working to solve the year-2000 problem -- creates inevitable problems for the fund industry, financial analysts say.
''I always get concerned when a fund group goes into so many areas at once, particularly when those areas are not linked to any particular ability that the fund company has,'' said Kurt Cerulli, a Boston fund consultant.

That has been the case for much of the fund industry in the last several years.
In trying to establish the breadth of product line needed to be considered for corporate 401(k) and other retirement programs, fund families have added funds that invest in obscure overseas markets, funds that specialize in various industries and portfolios that spread assets across all types of financial securities.
The strategy also helps fund companies by increasing the chance that at least one of their funds will land in the upper ranks of the performance tables, drawing attention and new investors.
But rather than being seduced by such variety, an investor may be able to improve performance by looking for a company that has funds in just a few categories, and that performs admirably in them.

''I think if a fund company doesn't have a deep expertise in a particular area, it doesn't have any business offering a product to the public in that area,'' Mr. Cerulli said.
''You may hire a manager with expertise in that area, but if as a company you don't have that depth, how do you tell when a manager is straying into areas where he shouldn't be?''
The problem, Mr. Cerulli said, is that the most esoteric investment areas also carry the most risk.
So when a downturn comes, liquidity dries up quickly, making losses worse.
Mr. Cerulli said that if those more obscure types of funds do not perform well, fund companies are right to shut them down.
As emerging markets have crumbled around the world, investors have fled from many of those funds.
In the last several weeks, as their assets have dropped to levels that make the funds unprofitable to operate, at least a half-dozen Asian and emerging-market funds have announced plans to liquidate or be merged into larger funds.
And after getting off to a similarly poor start in the first half of this year, Mr. DiCarlo stepped down.
Mr. DiCarlo could not be reached for comment last week.
When he stepped down from the John Hancock fund, he said in a news release: ''The performance of the target universe of the fund has been disappointing over the last two years, as has the fund's performance.
Still, I am very appreciative to have served on behalf of all those involved with Special Equities fund.''

And Paul Stephens, chief investment officer for the Robertson Stephens mutual funds and manager of the high-profile Robertson Stephens Contrarian fund, gave up some of his duties last month after a similarly prolonged slide.
While he remains at the fund, he now shares managerial duties with two colleagues, Andrew P. Pilara Jr. and Roderick R. Berry.
The Contrarian fund aims to buy out-of-favor investments that will perform well when the current favorites run cold; instead, even the worst-performing general stock funds in this year's market slide had to sprint to beat it to the bottom of the rankings.
After one of the best performances among world stock funds in 1995 and 1996, the Contrarian fund lost 30 percent last year and 37 percent in the first nine months of 1998 -- leaving it with cumulative losses of roughly 20 percent since the fund's inception in June 1993.
Mr. Stephens did not return a phone call seeking comment.
But Mr. Pilara said that while the fund has not changed its strategy, the new managers ''will give us a greater breadth of sectors and ideas'' from which to choose investments.
THAT such dismal performances can last so long usually means that more went against a manager than just his investment style going out of favor.
Something else also falters -- his stock-picking, his expectation of which way interest rates will go or the like.
But out of such extended periods of dismal performance, opportunities are born.
It is hard to believe, for example, that there are no hidden gems among small-cap stocks, which have far underperformed the large stocks that have benefited from equity investors' recent flight to quality.
Mark A. Coffelt, manager of Texas Capital Value and Growth, certainly believes there are.
''When the psychology shifts, the place to be will be in small caps,'' Mr. Coffelt said.
''The valuations already are incredibly compressed.
Small caps are selling at 50 percent of the valuations of large-cap stocks.
I think we will be in a recession sometime in the next five years, and maybe we already are.
But at this stage I think that small stocks have already largely discounted that.''
In other words, the best opportunities might be in funds investors have all but ignored in the last year.
While Morningstar Inc. lists it as a diversified stock fund, the Securities and Exchange Commission classifies it as nondiversified.
To the Editor:
Re ''From Brazil's Perspective, a Bailout Shouldn't Have to Hurt'' (news article, Oct. 7): When Brazilians say they do not want a ''package,'' they are thinking of a series of arbitrary measures, some of dubious legality, put in place overnight to seek a quick solution to a serious problem.
These packages have included price and wage freezes and changes in the way interest rates, rents and taxes are calculated.
Such steps are vital with soaring inflation.
JAMES SINCLAIR
New York, Oct. 7, 1998
The new work builds on a well-established body of research pointing to calcium's complex role in the body.
Through the years, scientists have demonstrated that calcium is required for myriad body functions:
*Transmission of nerve impulses that control muscle contractions.
*Release of chemicals that carry messages between nerves.
*Binding together of cells to form organs.
*Production and activity of enzymes and hormones that regulate digestion, fat metabolism, energy release and saliva production.
*Clotting of the blood to initiate wound healing.
*Secretion of hormones and other substances from glands throughout the body.
*Chemical signaling within cells.
*Growth and maturation of lining cells throughout the body.
''It's not surprising that calcium plays so many roles,'' said Dr. Hector F. DeLuca, a biochemist at the University of Wisconsin who is an expert on vitamin D and calcium metabolism.
''Since all life originated in the sea in a bath containing calcium, we all developed systems that depend on it.''
This mechanism involves vitamin D. In its activated form as a hormone, vitamin D enables calcium to enter the blood through the intestinal wall and be incorporated into bone.
But if the body does not receive enough dietary calcium to maintain the needed blood level, parathyroid hormone leaps to the rescue.
Its job is to signal the release of calcium from the bones to restore a normal blood level of this life-sustaining mineral.
If the diet is chronically deficient in calcium (or vitamin D), as it is for as many as three-fourths of Americans, the bones gradually get weaker and weaker.
PMS and Bone Disease
A chronic deficiency or imbalance of calcium is what Dr. Susan Thys-Jacobs, a gynecologist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, believes is largely responsible for the disruptive symptoms of PMS suffered by as many as 40 percent of women.
In fact, Dr. Thys-Jacobs said, PMS may be a harbinger of osteoporosis, a warning that a woman is not getting enough calcium and, as a result, is constantly losing bone.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Buoyed by the promising results of a pilot study of calcium's ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms and menstrual pain, Dr. Thys-Jacobs and colleagues at 11 other medical centers enrolled nearly 500 women with debilitating PMS in a trial of calcium's ability to relieve their monthly discomfort.
Dr. Thys-Jacobs concluded that women with PMS might have a form of ''functional hypocalcemia'' -- calcium levels in their blood and urine are normal, but only because parathyroid hormone levels are abnormally high and the hormone is continually extracting calcium from their bones to replenish the blood's supply.
She suggested that all women with PMS be assessed for deficiencies of calcium and vitamin D, as indicated by their blood levels of parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D. She pointed out that ''80 percent of a person's vitamin D is made in the skin when exposed to sunlight, but a lot of young women are now avoiding the sun and using sunscreens.''

''Their vitamin D levels are very low,'' Dr. Thys-Jacobs ''and therefore they're not absorbing enough calcium from their diet even if they consume enough, which most young women do not.''
Effect on Cancers
Tissues throughout the body are lined with epithelial cells like the ones that form the outer layer of skin.
They grow, mature, slough off and are replaced by new ones.
In the lining of the colon, where cancers arise, the turnover of epithelial cells normally takes a week.
But in people prone to colon cancer, these cells fail to grow and mature normally and instead immature cells proliferate rapidly.
Studies in people and animals have linked high fat diets to colon cancer and shown that fatty acids and the bile acids released to process them are irritants that stimulate abnormal cell proliferation in the colon.
Dr. Martin Lipkin of the Strang Cancer Research Laboratory at Rockefeller University in New York described studies showing that calcium could bind tightly to these irritants and inhibit their ability to stimulate cell proliferation.
With calcium present, as it would be on a calcium-rich diet, the cells differentiate and mature like normal epithelial cells.
Dr. Lipkin and his colleagues showed that calcium supplements could inhibit colonic cell proliferation in people susceptible to colon cancer.

Regulating Blood Pressure
A person's blood pressure is influenced by many factors, including genetics, body weight, physical activity and, in some cases, salt intake.
But dozens of studies since the early 1980's have also implicated calcium as a potentially important contributor to normal blood pressure, especially the calcium found in dairy products.
The findings suggest that a low intake of calcium-rich dairy products may partly account for the high rates of hypertension among African-Americans.
A shortage of calcium might also contribute to the rise in blood pressure that commonly accompanies aging.
Even if calcium intake is adequate, which it usually is not, most older people are deficient in the active form of vitamin D needed to absorb calcium.
Though he was a co-author of the association's statement, which was published recently in the journal Circulation, Dr. David McCarron, a hypertension specialist at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, champions the view that calcium-rich milk products are more effective than a low-sodium diet in curbing hypertension.
Nearly half of Americans consume less than 450 milligrams of calcium a day, ''and it's getting worse,'' Dr. McCarron said.
His main concern now is the ''seriously deficient'' diet consumed by a very large proportion of American children.
Children, he said, are drinking soda and juices, not milk, and they rarely come close to eating the recommended five servings a day of fruits and vegetables.
He believes parents and schools are setting children up for a lifetime of ill health.
''Calcium is a lot more than simply bone health,'' Dr. McCarron concluded.
Correction: October 16, 1998, Friday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about calcium misidentified Dr. Susan Thys-Jacobs, a researcher at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York who links chronic calcium deficiency to the disruptive symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.
She is an endocrinologist, not a gynecologist.
Mr. Duisenberg's remarks, which came after a meeting of the bank's governing council, underline a growing divergence between monetary policy in Europe and the United States.
While the Federal Reserve has begun lowering American interest rates amid fear of a significant slowdown in the economy, the European bankers are barely flinching from their original course and remain preoccupied with establishing the new currency's credibility.

A surprising effect of that policy has been the strength of existing European currencies, like the German mark and the French franc, which essentially mirror expectations for the euro.
Traders, far from being skittish about an untested currency in the offing, have begun buying the current national currencies as a haven from global shocks in Asia, Latin America and Russia.
The mark and the franc are nearly 10 percent stronger against the dollar than they were in August.
In recent days, the European Central Bank has come under increasing pressure from national leaders to either reduce interest rates or support other measures to keep European growth from slipping.
In Germany, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroder has called for lower rates, and his designated finance minister has repeatedly assailed the German central bank's, and by extension the European bank's, tight-money policies as misguided.
The French Cabinet continues its complaints against those policies.

Most economists predict that growth in the so-called euro zone will remain above 2.5 percent through the end of 1998 but will substantially slow next year.
The continuing problems in Asia and Latin America are expected to curtail demand for European exports, and the recent shift in exchange rates will dig more deeply by making European exports more expensive in dollar terms.
Signs of slowing growth are already becoming apparent in Germany, where industrial exports have been the economic engine in the last 18 months.
Machine-tool and engineering companies have lowered their forecasts for exports next year.
Hoechst, the chemical and pharmaceutical giant, warned on Monday that its profits in the second half of this year would fall below those in the period a year earlier.
European banks are also reporting big setbacks and are eliminating thousands of jobs because of losses in securities trading, soured foreign loans and heightened competitive pressure.
In the last 10 days, the chairmen of two leading financial institutions -- UBS of Switzerland and ING Barings in the Netherlands -- have resigned in the wake of big losses.
Some analysts expect more bad news in the months ahead, predicting that banks will be forced to write off more foreign loans than they already have.
Mr. Duisenberg acknowledged that financial crises elsewhere would affect Europe.
''The number of signs suggesting that the world economy will slow down in 1999 is increasing,'' he said at a news conference here today.
But he insisted that ''proposals inspired by policy activism'' must be avoided.
''There are no signs of a credit crunch in Europe,'' he maintained.

The European Central Bank is still struggling with the tools it will use to set monetary policy, torn between basing it simply on the growth of the money supply or on inflation targets.
In principle, many central bankers would prefer to follow the example of the Bundesbank, which bases lending rates almost entirely on the growth of the German money supply.
In practice, money statistics vary considerably between countries in the new currency union, and new forms of financial transactions have further complicated the definitions of money.
After months of debate behind closed doors, Mr. Duisenberg announced that the bank would use both money supply and inflation targets.
The overall goal will be to keep inflation under 2 percent.
''The political pressure could increase -- I would not deny that,'' he said.
''But it is pressure against a strong institution.
We will make our own judgments, use our own analysis and reach our own decisions.''
AS the stock market lurches like an elevator out of control, a growing number of would-be apartment buyers are seeking to take advantage of the current uncertainty by making ''take it or leave it'' bargain-basement offers on co-ops and condominiums -- and getting nowhere, brokers say.
In the current market, where many apartments, especially the overpriced ones, have already come down a peg or two in price, brokers say that sellers are feeling squeezed by these bottom fishers.
''They've already reduced it, and that's where the insult comes,'' said Richard S. Orenstein, an agent at the Halstead Property Company.
Neil Binder, an owner of Bellmarc Realty, which has seven offices and 250 sales agents, said that his company's statistics show that apartments are now selling for prices that are 7 to 10 percent lower than they were in June.
But for some bidders, he added, that isn't enough of a reduction.
''The buyers are acting like the world is about to end and sellers should be happy to get anything for their apartment,'' Mr. Binder said.
''Well, it's no fire sale out there -- not with interest rates the lowest they've been in 30 years.''

No one questions the buyer's right to make a low-ball bid, but their problem is that sellers are rejecting the offers.
Not only that, she added, ''but we're seeing that even when deals fall through, negotiations with someone else begin quite quickly.''
But she agreed that, over all, apartment owners are becoming ''more reasonable'' and are negotiating more on prices, which she called a ''very desirable thing.''
He argued that there are many differences between then and now and that no one is sure the same kind of decline will occur.
''People are remembering that prices did drop,'' he said, ''but they're not remembering how long it took.''
Some would-be buyers are ''chumming the waters for spectacular fish, but they aren't catching any,'' Mr. Halstead said, continuing: ''They don't realize that we don't have a ticker tape in the real estate office.
People are nervous about the securities market, and they impute that shaky feeling to everything from pork bellies to houses.''
He also said that of all Manhattan's neighborhoods, those south of 23d Street, particularly Greenwich Village, TriBeCa and SoHo, have been least affected by nerves.
''Sales there continue unabated,'' he said.
''It's very chic, and the people buying there are leaders, not followers.''

''It's spotty everywhere,'' he said.
''It depends on who your buyer is.
The people who are financially secure, and know that real estate is a long-term choice, aren't anxious about whether they can save a few dollars by waiting a few weeks.
The people who are more anxious are people who are heavily in the stock market and regard real estate as more of an investment than a home.''
But Mr. Peters knows about offers that go straight for the jugular.
The listing price had just been reduced to $2,695,000, which is not a bad price for 3,200 square feet.
The man made what agents call a very aggressive bid: $2.5 million.
''What do you think the seller did?''
Acting on his own authority after consulting by telephone with members of the Fed's policy-making committee, Alan Greenspan, the chairman, reduced the Federal funds target for the overnight lending rate between banks by a quarter-point, to 5 percent.
The cut was intended to encourage more lending and to bolster the economy by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow.

The central bank's board also approved a quarter-point reduction in the discount rate on loans from the Federal Reserve to banks.
''Growing caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally are likely to be restraining aggregate demand in the future,'' the Federal Reserve said in a statement, referring to the likelihood of a slowdown.
Several banks quickly reduced their prime rates on loans to their best customers, setting off a cycle that could lead to slightly lower rates on credit cards, auto loans and other loans to consumers.
While the Federal Reserve's action does not directly affect mortgage rates, which have been creeping up from very low levels, it could help push them back down by putting pressure on the long-term rates set in the bond market.
The interest rate cut sent stock prices soaring around the world.
The dollar, which has been sliding sharply against the Japanese yen, fell again.
The markets have been especially skittish since the near-collapse last month of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., the prominent hedge fund.
''Whenever the Fed does something out of the ordinary, it makes you wonder, and the first thing that comes to mind is whether there is some other financial market land mine out there,'' said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
''Obviously they felt a need to move that couldn't wait a month.
It's a bit of a mystery.''

There were no immediate signs of any bank or investment firm running into deep trouble.
But Mr. Greenspan and other policy makers in Washington have been fretting in public for the last week about how the crisis of confidence has affected even the safest haven, the market for United States Treasury securities.

For the last several months, investors worldwide have been dumping stocks and bonds almost indiscriminately and putting their money into Treasury bonds.
But in recent weeks economists have noticed that within the Treasury market investors are increasingly buying only the newest issues, which tend to trade most readily, and avoiding older issues, for which there is a less liquid market.
As Mr. Greenspan pointed out in a speech last week, investors are therefore demanding not just safety in their investments but the ability to sell them instantaneously.
The development was a troublesome sign, Mr. Greenspan suggested, because companies are already having trouble raising money in the stock and bond markets and banks are showing signs of pulling back on new lending.
If their access to money dried up, businesses would have to cut back on their investments in new technology and equipment, which have driven much of the economy's growth in recent years.
''What is now a Wall Street problem threatened to become a Main Street problem.
What the Fed is doing now makes me less pessimistic about the risks next year.''
In moving today, more than a month before the next scheduled Fed meeting on Nov. 17, Mr. Greenspan again asserted his power at the Fed, sweeping aside any remaining objections from colleagues who think rate cuts could backfire if the economy proves more resilient than it appears.
It is unclear whether Mr. Greenspan had specifically requested the authority from the policy-making committee to cut rates another quarter-point before the next meeting.
Mr. Greenspan had room to move, though, precisely because there have been so few signs of inflation in the economy.

The Federal Reserve's action came against a backdrop of efforts by policy makers around the world to bring the financial crisis under control.
Japan took a big step this week toward addressing the problems that have paralyzed its banking system, agreeing on a plan to spend up to $500 billion to shore up ailing institutions.
And today, Congress came to a final agreement with the Clinton Administration on new money for the International Monetary Fund, which is assembling a package of financial aid for Brazil.
Pressure is growing on Germany's powerful central bank to consider a rate cut; Britain and Spain have both cut rates in the last week.
Some analysts said the rate cuts by the Fed would not have as powerful a stimulative effect on the domestic economy as they would under normal circumstances.
That is because the long-term rates set in the markets are already relatively low and the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing, are already booming.
The fall in the dollar, they said, would help make American goods somewhat more competitive on international markets, giving a slight boost to the economy.
And to the extent that the weakening dollar increases the relative value of the yen, it will help inject more confidence into the moribund Japanese economy and avert further devaluations by other Asian countries.

The Federal Reserve's move last week to shave a quarter of a point from interest rates may not be the only thing going for the stock market for the remainder of the year.
While the 10.3 percent fall in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the third quarter was the seventh-worst for all the third quarters since World War II, that may actually portend some good news.
In that same issue of the newsletter, David Blitzer, chief economist of S.& P., made the prescient call that the Fed would continue to ease credit.
Dr. Blitzer sees opportunities ahead.
The Fed will ease rates by a further three-quarters of a percentage point by mid-1999, he predicted.
He also believes that by January, European monetary authorities ''will see the European version of what the Fed sees -- a credit crunch and no inflation,'' so they, too, will lower rates, giving more fuel to the global recovery.
Financial service stocks should be strong performers, he said, rebounding from the beating they have taken lately.
JAN M. ROSEN
DOLLAR DECLINES.
The dollar fell against the yen for a fourth consecutive session on expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates a third time this year.
Those who prefer more complex race cars can choose from two series for Indy cars, which are slightly lower-tech versions of Formula One.
Championship Auto Racing Teams, or CART, mixes oval tracks with the twisty Formula One style road-racing circuits; Indy-car fans with a poor sense of direction can watch the all-oval Indy Racing League.
And for those with absolutely no sense of direction, there is drag racing.

Nevertheless, Formula One's appeal in the United States should not be dismissed -- not before taking a drive alongside the Pacific in Newport Beach, Calif., at 5 A.M. on a Sunday during a Grand Prix weekend.
That's when you will see about 150 people waiting to get into the Speedway International Racing Bistro and Bar.
Think of it as a Planet Hollywood with 200-mile-an-hour decor.
Grand Prix fans commune here at that ungodly hour -- a full 60 minutes before Bloody Marys can be legally served -- for the live Formula One telecasts from Europe shown on the Speedvision cable network.
''We have a huge, huge interest in this thing,'' said one of the restaurant's owners, Nick Costa.
''They scream and yell during the races.''
Mr. Costa estimates that only 20 percent of his clientele are expatriates looking for a Grand Prix fix.
If negotiations work out, the United States Grand Prix could return in 2000 at a new track inside the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
A group in Dallas has also expressed interest in a grand prix, but the Speedway's desire -- and pockets -- are deep enough to land the race.
ANY American track owner willing to pay the $10 million to $15 million generally thought necessary to acquire rights to a Formula One race will probably need to multiply the Speedway Bistro crowd by a factor of 1,000 to be successful.
That's because Formula One officials will also demand costly safety improvements (like extensive runoff areas in the turns with gravel pits as carefully raked as a Japanese garden) and other amenities (like pit-side garages with corporate suites on top) that no United States sanctioning group requires.
And unlike Nascar, Formula One -- the name given to the set of rules that defines the most technically advanced race cars -- does not share its fees from broadcasting rights with track owners.
''The problem with holding a Grand Prix in the United States is cost,'' said Roger Werner, the founder and president of Speedvision.
''The series is the ultimate in motor sports.
It is also the most expensive, not surprisingly.
So to bring the show to town, it's a big, big number.
And most private promoters have a hard time making that equation work.''
IT is even harder when you are competing with big spenders like the Malaysian and Chinese Governments, which are ready to pay whatever it takes to become one of only 16 countries granted a Formula One race annually.
Based on ticket prices at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, American fans can expect to pay $100 or more for a seat at any future United States Grand Prix.

''I think there is room for one, and I think there is a demand for one,'' said Danny Sullivan, the 1985 Indy 500 winner, who drove a Formula One car in 1983.
''But I hope any United States Grand Prix gets put in one venue and stays there.''
In many countries, the Formula One race is synonymous with one track: Monza in Italy, for example.
In retrospect, the West Coast race -- a glamorous event that was the Pacific Coast's equivalent of the Monaco Grand Prix -- may have been the undoing of the East Coast race.
A similar fate befell the Detroit Grand Prix in 1988, after six years.
The 90's have seen Nascar become the American brand of racing; according to the annual racing-attendance survey by Goodyear, the Winston Cup drew an average of 190,355 fans per event in 1997.
''In Italy or other countries, their Grand Prix is the biggest race of the year,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
''But over here, besides Nascar, we have CART and the Indy Racing League in Indy-car racing.''
Besides competing for fans, these American series snatch up talented young American drivers who, like Mr. Sullivan, used to go to Europe to start their careers.
''In Europe, they're not that keen on American drivers because they haven't proved themselves over the years,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
''And that's because American drivers have plenty of opportunities over here.''

THE last American to race on the Formula One tour was Michael Andretti, son of the 1978 Formula One champion Mario Andretti.
2 driver behind the great Ayrton Senna of Brazil -- the equivalent of playing behind Cal Ripken Jr. And that, his father says, demonstrates another reason young Americans like Jeff Gordon, the Nascar star, don't want to try Formula One.
''The lure isn't there,'' Mario Andretti said, ''because in Formula One, unless you're with one of the top three teams, you'll never get to show your talents.''
Mr. Sullivan said that having an American Formula One driver would certainly help a future United States Grand Prix.
''We're all the same,'' he said.
''We want to root for our nationality competing against other nationalities.
''So New York is a big market,'' he said.
''Boston's a big market, L.A. -- and Miami, of course, because you have a lot of South Americans and it's a very big sport on that continent.''
It is this audience that must help Formula One regain a beachhead in the United States.
Nascar's TV ratings, which take a back seat only to the National Football League and the baseball playoffs, are particularly strong in rural areas.
Asking stock-car fans to acquire a taste for Formula One may be like asking a Bud drinker to start sipping Campari.
Then again, this is the land that new Ferraris call home more than any other.
''Anyone who says U.S. racing fans don't care about Formula One is completely wrong,'' Mario Andretti said.
''It's the same people who say American drivers can't cut it.''
''It doesn't do us any good to receive products,'' said Mr. Silveira, whose family scrapes by on his $300 a month, and on the sewing his wife takes in.
''You'd have to know how to resell the goods, but I have no idea how to do that.
That's what the company is supposed to do.''

Joseph Couri, president of the Association of Small Industries in Sao Paulo, said that with access to credit shrinking, companies might not have much choice but to pay workers in products instead of cash at the end of the year.
''It's a real possibility,'' he said, ''because the financial system is highly selective, interest rates are high and there's a great difficulty in gaining access to credit.''
The 13th month's salary is not a bonus, but a legally mandated payment due all workers.
Employers pay salaries on a monthly basis in Brazil, but because the payments cover four weeks, the 13th payment at the end of the year compensates for the extra days each month.
Brazil's plight is not nearly as severe as Russia's, where the trade in, say, shoes for shirts, has replaced cash as the dominant form of commerce in parts of the country.
And in contrast to Russia, barter is being proposed only for the 13th-month payment, not for full salaries.
Political leaders here are poised to announce a $20 billion austerity package that should bring down spending and raise revenue.
The Government retains good relations with an array of international lending agencies led by the International Monetary Fund, which has promised a package of aid for Brazil that will probably total around $30 billion.
But with two rounds of national elections this month, the Government has delayed spelling out the painful measures it must use to bring Brazil in from the financial brink, and the nation's financial position remains shaky.
This week, J. P. Morgan ranked Brazil the fourth-riskiest country for doing business, after Russia, Indonesia and Ecuador -- all of which have devalued currencies or defaulted on foreign debt.
''Everybody needs to think about how to survive,'' said Roberto Faldini, a board member of the Industrial Federation of Sao Paulo.
''It's a possible solution to the lack of money for the company and the workers.''
Brazilian officials, led by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, have held fast to a commitment not to devalue the currency, the real, which means royal in Portuguese.
Officials in Brasilia, the capital, argue that the country's exchange-rate policy, which allows the currency to gradually fall in value around 7.5 percent a year within an exchange-rate band, allows flexibility without instability.
They insist that any devaluation, given Brazil's history, would bring back indexing and hyperinflation.

''To think Brazil can have 10 percent inflation and it will stop there is completely wrong,'' said Demosthenes Madureira do Pinho, head of international relations at the central bank.
Economists who propose a policy permitting moderate inflation, notably Rudiger Dornbush of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, are off, Mr. Pinho argues.
''What they're saying is: 'I don't know that country's reality.
I don't know anything about Brazil,' '' Mr. Pinho said.

But an important consequence of the decision not to formally devalue is a recession that is hitting Sao Paulo especially hard.
Without devaluing, the Government had to raise the ceiling on interbank loan rates to 50 percent to defend the currency, choking off credit for industrial expansion.
Business loans, available only to the most creditworthy, are running 40 to 50 percent a year, while consumer lending rates exceed 120 percent.
The overvalued currency is shrinking the market for exports.
The current account deficit, a broad gauge of trade in goods and services, is running at 4 percent of the gross national product, or $32 billion.
And, Mr. Couri said, the Government appears to be relying on raising taxes, including those on businesses and financial transactions, to make up a substantial portion of the $20 billion it must save next year to win I.M.F.
backing.
''It's the same as raising the cost of credit for banks, and consequently the same as raising interest rates,'' he said.
''It runs exactly counter to what we need.''
He said individual companies were reluctant to speak openly of the difficulties that are pushing them to consider paying workers with goods.
Doing so, they fear, would undermine their standing with creditors and clients.
Mr. Faldini of the industrial federation said companies would work out barter agreements case by case with workers and unions, perhaps offering only partial payment in goods.
He described barter as a way of meeting obligations to workers, instead of not paying them, and said it would probably be tried in consumer-goods industries like textiles, food and toys, adding: ''Instead of sending them to court to receive what they need to receive in three or four years, there are some companies that said, 'Well, I don't have money.
I know I have to pay the 13th salary, and maybe I cannot sell my merchandise because of crisis.
Why not make an agreement that I would pay part in goods and part in money?'
''
Unemployment is running at 19 percent in the Sao Paulo area and 8 percent nationally, with some economists predicting an increase half that again in national unemployment.
Workers see the barter proposal as the harbinger of worse times to come.
''It's the situation of the country that's in crisis,'' Mr. Silveira, the glove maker, said.
Labor unions have already granted broad concessions in an effort to avoid layoffs.
At car and appliance factories, workers have agreed to collective vacations and to staying home when they are not needed on the factory floor, making up the time when demand picks up.
But they say that passing up a month's salary, or receiving it in screwdrivers or shoes, is beyond the limit.
''The companies always take out whatever problems they're having on the workers.''
Claudio de Souza, 25, who sells stereo equipment and television sets at the Mappin department store here, said he would not mind taking his 13th month in goods.

But others, like Mr. Silveira, worry about ending the year shortchanged.
In the last four years, business at his factory, which makes industrial gloves for metal workers, has dropped 40 percent.
The work force has shrunk to 5 from 11.
''We could lose our jobs because of this crisis,'' he said.
He was on the bench from 1966 to 1973, carrying on after suffering two strokes in the late 1960's.
While serving in the Chancery Division in Morris County, his thorough oral and written decisions took on statewide and national significance, particularly in his final years on the bench.
He handled ''novel impression'' cases with no clear legal precedents to guide him, touching on social issues like religion in the classroom, airport noise and sex education.
His most celebrated case involved the school board of Netcong, N.J., which had a policy providing for daily school readings of prayers published regularly in the Congressional Record, as delivered by Congressional chaplains at the start of the day.

By discounting ''beautiful prayers'' as ''remarks,'' the board tried to ''peddle religion in a very cheap manner under an assumed name,'' he wrote, adding, ''This type of subterfuge is degrading to all religions.''
''Perhaps the time has arrived,'' he wrote, ''when the giants of industry will see the wisdom of slowing the cross-country speed of their important executives, and will take a close, concerned look at the little people of this country.''

After retiring to Connecticut, Judge Stamler developed a statewide program for youthful first offenders, some still in their pre-teens, to teach them respect for the law.
It let them learn by playing the roles of lawyers, judges, jurors and other court figures in moot cases.
The bar association conducts it as part of its efforts to inform people how their judicial system works.
He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Lillian Spitzer Stamler; two sons, Joseph Jr., of Fairfield, Conn., and S. Paul, of Stony Creek, Conn., and four grandchildren.
In 10 buildings that Mr. Walentas owns, with 2 million square feet of space, are high-end apartments, artists' studios, offices, factories and storerooms.
His vision -- by no means universally shared or admired -- is to supplement these with a waterfront entertainment, retail and recreation center, largely for Brooklyn residents, with a marina, a historic carousel, movie theaters, a hotel, many stores and plenty of parking in multilevel garages.

Like any precinct in transition, Dumbo shows different facets to different viewers.
A newcomer might see it as raw, stark, desolate; a Depression-era Berenice Abbott photograph come to life, with a faintly sinister quality that is more than just imagined.
Those who know the area see something else: joggers, artists, dog-walkers, parents taking children to school -- the seeds of a neighborhood.
''One day, it's all heavy machinery and trucks,'' said Ivan Schwartz, who has worked in the area since 1985.
''The next day, there are happenings and Europeans with cameras.''
That may be just the start.
Two Trees Development, which David Walentas owns, has applied for the rezoning of five more blocks, has been conditionally designated as the developer of a city-owned waterfront lot north of the Gair complex and was the only respondent to a request for proposals for the adaptive reuse of the nearby Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park.
Jed Walentas, who is managing the project for his father, likened the broader redevelopment to Harborplace in Baltimore.
''Brooklyn is a huge middle-class city with very few activities for middle-class families,'' he said.
Opponents see a forest of problems in Two Trees, believing that the company will commercialize and privatize the waterfront, flood the surrounding area with automobile traffic, deplete what little open space remains and create a social, economic and physical barrier between a precious segment of shoreline and less affluent neighborhoods like Vinegar Hill.
Mr. Walentas will face political obstacles no matter what he does.
But in at least one respect, his prospects may be brighter than ever.
Although he was anathema at City Hall during Edward I. Koch's mayoralty -- purely for personal reasons, he asserts -- Mr. Walentas has found a warmer reception from the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, even if it falls short of an unreserved embrace.
''There are a lot of people who are opposed to anything and some of them live in the Down Under area,'' said Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation (who dislikes the name Dumbo).
''But the reality is that while there may be some specific flaws in this plan, it's going to create investment and jobs in New York.''
Joseph B.
''It's a great opportunity to develop an exciting piece of waterfront,'' he said, but it ''has to balance a complex set of economic, transportation and land-use planning questions.''

Mr. Rose was less reserved about rezoning measures that permit residential and commercial uses in this manufacturing district.
''We're definitely sympathetic to the goal,'' he said.
''It allows for the emergence of additional SoHos and TriBeCas.''
The rezoning allowed Mr. Walentas to convert the 16-story factory at 1 Main Street into a 124-unit condominium loft building that is now called the Clock Tower.
But the measure was endorsed by Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn, who was described by his chief of staff, Greg Brooks, as being ''very pleased to see that the change in zoning created the impetus for the Clock Tower, which is upscale housing, something that the borough really needs.''
AND Mr. Millard said: ''We have already learned the folly of trying to save manufacturing-only zoning in places where people would otherwise be willing to make a serious investment.''
Serious, indeed.
The Clock Tower conversion was designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, which is also planning the more ambitious development.
Best known for the renovation of Grand Central Terminal, Beyer Blinder Belle has worked for Mr. Walentas since the mid-70's, rehabilitating hundreds of modest housing units, including the Kew Gardens Hills project in Queens; renovating the landmark Alwyn Court Apartments at 182 West 58th Street and converting the Silk Building, 692 Broadway, at East Fourth Street, into lofts.

Apartments in the Clock Tower range from one to three bedrooms and in price from $300,000 to more than $1 million (on average, about $300 a square foot).
For $4 million, a buyer with more imagination than budgetary restraints can pick up the clock loft, a raw space of 3,500 square feet with 25-foot-high ceilings and four see-through clock faces, 15 feet in diameter.
Mr. Walentas and his wife, Jane, plan to move into the unit immediately below the clock loft, which also commands unobstructed views to every point on the compass.
''Our life revolves around Dumbo so we thought, 'Why not?'
Mrs. Walentas, an art director who holds a master's degree in fine arts, has been involved in the furnishing and design of the Clock Tower apartments.
But purchases have started to slow.
''I don't know whether that's because it's later in the year, or because of the market turmoil or because the units that are left are the larger family units,'' he said.
The application that is now under review would create a special mixed-use zoning district for five blocks on which seven of Mr. Walentas's buildings stand.
This would permit residential use in addition to the light manufacturing, warehousing, offices and studios that are now allowed.
Mr. Walentas would convert two vacant buildings, probably into rental apartments: 75 Washington Street, at York Street, and 66 Water Street, near Main Street.
Because his broader redevelopment project involves city- and state-owned land, it will be subject to many approvals.

''There is almost nothing it doesn't need,'' said Raymond H. Levin, of Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding, the lawyers for Two Trees.
''Mappings, de-mappings, garage special permits, rezonings, zoning text changes, Landmarks, Corps of Engineers, Department of Environmental Conservation.
There will be numerous opportunities for public review, comment and input.''
And no one expects the residents of Brooklyn Heights, Fulton Ferry, Dumbo, Vinegar Hill and Bridge Plaza to be shy in expressing objections.
Already, several community-based plans have been drawn up.
The Old Brooklyn Waterfront Alliance, which was formed last year, has called for ''greenspace'' from the Empire-Fulton Ferry park to a point one block north of the Manhattan Bridge.
Mr. Walentas said his plan would expand parkland.
''Instead of a three-acre park,'' he said, ''we'll have eight or nine acres of park, with a boardwalk that runs three-quarters of a mile.''
But that amenity comes at a price: the commercial development of the surroundings, including a city-owned parking lot on Plymouth Street that neighbors would also like to see as a park.
On that lot, stretching out to pilings in the East River, Mr. Walentas would build the Main Street Pier Building, envisioned as a 350,000-square-foot structure including a 150-room hotel, five to six stories high; a movie theater with 12 to 16 screens and 60,000 square feet of shops and restaurants.
More shops and restaurants, perhaps 250,000 square feet in all, would go into the Empire Stores, an abandoned warehouse on Water Street, between Dock and Main Streets, that looks almost medieval, with its solemn ranks of round-arched doorways and windows, some sealed by iron shutters.
Beans still litter the floors.
The Empire Stores is in the Empire-Fulton Ferry park and the city-designated Fulton Ferry Historic District.

Besides redeveloping the Empire Stores, Mr. Walentas would extend the park up to 50 feet, to the pierhead line.
At the water's edge, he would install a historic 1922 carousel from Idora Park in Youngstown, Ohio, with 48 wooden horses and 2 chariots.

Mr. Walentas is seeking a 49-year lease on the property, rather than the customary 20-year concession term, which would require the approval of the State Legislature.
A spokesman for the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Joseph A. Picchi, said last week that ''negotiations are still going on.''
Neighbors are far less enamored of the redevelopment plan.
''Everybody locally is in favor of a park,'' said Richard Brachman, an artist and member of the waterfront alliance, ''yet this regional shopping destination is still seriously being considered.''
A plan drawn up in May by the Community Board's land-use committee recommended that the waterfront be ''devoted to the maximum extent possible to open space, park and recreational opportunities open to the public and accessible to all, including lower-income members of the community.''
''There is no lack of opportunity for people in Brooklyn to find a place to spend money,'' said Paul DiLeo, chairman of the waterfront subcommittee of Community Board 2.
''However, there are not many places where you can go and not be confronted with a commercial environment.''
No less controversial is Mr. Walentas's proposal to build a 1,200-space parking garage under the Brooklyn Bridge and a 1,300-space garage under the Manhattan Bridge.
''For all this to work, you need parking,'' he said.
''Our plan is to put parking where nobody wants to be anyway.''

That is not how Doreen Gallo sees it.
''Do you want parking there or a park?''
''The closer to the waterfront you get, the more openness there should be.''
Ms. Gallo, an artist and member of the steering committee of the Dumbo Neighborhood Association, said she takes her 17-month-old daughter, Giovanna, to Empire-Fulton Ferry park every day.
Mr. Walentas also hopes to tear down a 1936 warehouse known as the Purchase Building, 11 Water Street, in the historic district.
Because no demolition application has reached the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the chairwoman, Jennifer J. Raab, declined to discuss the matter.
Razing the building, Mr. Walentas said, would open an extraordinary vista from Old Fulton Street to the Williamsburg Bridge in the distance.
''No one will believe the view,'' he said.
''We're talking about a $300 million project and this is the front door.''
IT is also a long way from his first investment, 30 years ago, in a five-story apartment building at Manhattan Avenue and 104th Street.
Then he began looking for other opportunities.
''I always believe in following the artists,'' he said.
Mr. Walentas cannot recall exactly who suggested the manufacturing lofts between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges.
But he does remember the day he first visited the site.
''He erected, one after another, the massive monolithic concrete buildings which now compose 'Gairville,' the most modern and thoroughly fireproof structures as yet known,'' Bonner wrote.

There followed what Peter J. Johnson, a state development official at the time, called ''an epic of Marx Brothers proportions, without the comic ending.''
Majestic pays $3 a square foot annually for 20,000 square feet.
Sam and Bala Silver founded the company in 1965 and it is continued today by their son, Moses.
Majestic employs 30 workers to make men's and boys' all-weather coats with zip-out linings, long dress coats, pea coats and suede-collar jackets.
''This is a dying trade in New York City, this kind of manufacturing,'' Mr. Silver said frankly.
It is not a business he expects to hand over to any of his nine children.
''None are interested,'' he said.
That is not to say that manufacturing has disappeared from Gairville, only that it is growing more in synch with the times.

In the workshop now are figures of Diana Ross and the Supremes, bound for the Motown Cafe in Orlando, Fla., and the Martha Stewart holiday window displays for Sony Plaza on Madison Avenue, at 55th Street.
Unlike Ms. Stewart's recipes, the Schwartz brothers' cakes are made of auto-body putty and chopped up Styrofoam.
Having moved to Dumbo from the West Village in 1985, Ivan Schwartz confesses to mixed feelings about the transformation of this ''end-of-the-world spot.''

''On the other hand, all it takes is a certain investment, a Walentas kind of spirit and before too long we'll see restaurants.''
The biggest role in the rescue program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund, which said this week that it would contribute at least $15 billion -- and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even more.
Another $9 billion or so will come from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and the remainder from the United States and other major industrial nations.

Germany and Japan, though, have been reluctant to take part, one American official noted, suggesting that Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own.
So far, American officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for a direct contribution to Brazil.
''Brazil is very important to the economic well-being of the region, the United States and the international community, and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful,'' Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said on Friday.
and the World Bank here three weeks ago.
At the time, Mr. Clinton argued the fund should ''provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion'' rather than wait for disaster to strike.
Direct American aid to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc -- not only for Brazil, but to stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico and other countries that are major American trading partners.
That would be a change of strategy.
So far, the United States has operated almost entirely through international financial institutions, chiefly the I.M.F.
But it would also be a risky move for President Clinton, economically and politically.
Other Administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in Congress to direct American participation in a Brazil bailout.

''I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared to death by what's been happening in the markets, and what could happen in their own districts,'' a White House official said this week, ''and they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it.''
By acting soon to stabilize Latin America, the Administration is hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer panic that engulfed Russia and, at its height, led to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from Brazil, for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue its currency.
Whether this calm marks the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires that have erupted since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 is a matter of considerable debate.
But many experts cite the confluence of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the world: two successive interest rate cuts in the United States, Japan's long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing to return.

Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly on markets, Mr. Rubin acknowledged that ''in the last several weeks there have been a number of significant, positive developments.''
But the former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market rallies, warned that ''serious issues remain'' and that ''it will take some time for the world to work its way out'' of what he has repeatedly called ''the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 years.''
In fact, Mr. Rubin's aides are clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic, which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market countries to borrow money on world markets.
''In Brazil, the issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem.
And in Japan the question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the money.''
But after spending 18 months in frustrating negotiations with the Japanese, Mr. Rubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in Tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not lack of resources.
In Brazil, though, the United States has a better chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program, as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Mr. Cardoso and his team.
But demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt Administration to help stabilize the dollar.
The money is under Mr. Rubin's control, with Presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent Congressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995.

But the reaction was so strong -- for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts -- that Mr. Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since.
So far, Brazilian officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the I.M.F., convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against the country.
But at the same time, the Brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash -- and are certainly in no hurry to get it.
American officials and top officials of the I.M.F.
are clearly nervous, worried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater the risk that Brazil will be caught in another round of market turmoil.
''The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control,'' said an investment banker involved in the talks.
''But the fact is that there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months the Government is going to be forced to devalue'' its currency, which is pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a carefully controlled fall.
To prevent a sudden devaluation, the Brazilian Government has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent, choking off credit for most companies.
Meanwhile, the country is slipping into recession.
The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it is contingent on Mr. Cardoso's success in persuading the legislature to end huge deficits, chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending.
The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's austerity plan, expected to be announced after Sunday's elections but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that the global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil.
''Brazil has to do a lot,'' Mr. Fischer said last week before leaving on his trip.
''In return, I expect the international community will make a large contribution.''
As Japan struggles to revive its economy and avert a global recession, it is under enormous pressure to make itself more efficient and thus stimulate a new burst of economic growth.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But it finds itself profoundly torn, for efficiency would come at the price of egalitarianism and other values that many Japanese regard as at least as important as economic growth.
''Nowadays, everybody calls for reforms and efficiency,'' said Tomishige Yazaki, Daiki's principal.
''But if we just pursue efficiency, the world would become a very dry place, with no sensitivity.''
Japan is often denounced as recalcitrant and paralyzed as its economy sinks into its worst recession in six decades, and it is true that Japanese leaders have spent years denying the existence of economic nettles instead of grasping them.
But in some respects this is a principled paralysis.
Japan's economic catastrophe has harmed all of Asia and arises largely from political incompetence, endemic corruption, webs of relationships that misallocate resources and a parliamentary system that hugely over-represents the most backward parts of the country.
Some of Japan's most serious delays, such as confronting its bad debts and banking instability, have involved more paralysis than principle.
Yet while everyone around the globe is complaining about how bad Japan is, in other respects the problem is that it has been too good.
Economists have long known of the ''paradox of thrift,'' which states that although it is admirable to save, a country that saves too much ends up hurting itself.
That is one of Japan's ailments, but more broadly it is being pummeled by what might be called a ''paradox of virtue.''
The economy is in deep recession in part for reasons that, in an old-fashioned way, seem honorable: a passion for prudent fiscal planning, for stamping out inflation, for saving for the future and perhaps most important of all, concern for the human flotsam of capitalism and for equality for all citizens.
Fiscal Nightmare: Recklessness Urged
Japan's commitment to equality is intricately linked in at least two ways to its economic crisis -- and the world's.
First, it is producing a welfare state for the inefficient, leading to a growing misallocation of resources in the world's second-largest economy.

Second, the impulse to improve the quality of life in remote areas by building tiny schools and countless mountain roads has helped send costs spiraling out of control.
Soaring budget deficits and concern about how to pay for the retirement of Japan's baby boomers led the Government to raise taxes last year.
But even if its timing was catastrophic, Japan was trying to do what economists believe is in principle the right thing: reduce budget deficits and plan for the aging of the baby-boom generation.
All industrialized countries face this challenge but most have put off the hard decisions, while Japan's leaders last year ignored its economic weakness and confronted the problem by raising taxes.
The stock market is at a 12-year low, and Japan's biggest banks -- eight of which have assets worth as much as the entire Russian gross national product -- are wobbling.
''Japan has found itself in the position of fighting the last major economic war, the Great Depression,'' said Adam S. Posen, a scholar at the Institute for International Economics in Washington and author of a new book on Japan's economy.
''And its Government has chosen to pursue the strategy that lost that war.''
Mr. Posen and many other economists here and abroad recommend a gigantic fiscal stimulus, such as a huge new spending program coupled with tax cuts.
Japan has reluctantly taken steps in that direction, but it has dithered because huge spending increases seem so, well, irresponsible.
Japan finds itself hampered as well in its monetary policy, because in the past it attacked inflation so relentlessly that interest rates are extremely low.
That makes it difficult to ease monetary policy by lowering rates further, and so some experts are urging Japan to get out of this box by pledging to be irresponsible and taking steps to nurture inflation.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The upshot is that for a diligent, serious nation like Japan, the present economic crisis is a nightmare: it is being scolded on all sides and advised that it must be more fiscally reckless and monetarily irresponsible.
A fiscal or monetary stimulus may rescue Japan in the short run, but most economists here and abroad say that in the longer term Japan must restructure its economy and pay much more attention to efficiency rather than equality.
Yet the calls for efficiency run smack into the egalitarianism that has been a national ideology since the end of World War II, when a defeated Japan was told of the evils of its traditions of authoritarianism and hierarchy.

Many economists and business leaders say that an obsession with equality is stifling Japan.
Inefficiencies And Bureaucracies
Take the Government's building projects.
They are partly a way of showing thanks to construction companies, which contribute mightily to the Liberal Democrats.
Yet such projects also seem to reflect an egalitarian commitment to improve the lives of people in remote areas.
On Ikarajima, a sleepy little islet in southern Japan that is home to only 350 people, a dazzling new $125 million steel bridge rises like a mirage, to connect one end of the island with a neighboring island.
That led to some sniping about waste of money, and so plans for a $250 million bridge on the other side of Ikarajima have been put on hold for now.
''The island people have been eagerly waiting for this new bridge, but now because of reports of waste, they are deprived even of their dreams,'' said Kenzo Uehara, a town official on the island.
''I don't know that you can criticize these projects just by the logic of numbers.''
One of the most breathtaking economic inefficiencies is the expenditure on tiny schools with just a handful of students.
While Daiki's case is unusual, another school near Ichinosetakahashi also has just a single pupil, and so does a school in the southern city of Kumamoto.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Education Ministry says it does not know how many single-student schools there are in Japan.
But it says the country has 3,324 elementary schools -- 14 percent of the total -- with fewer than 50 students in all grades put together.
Why run an entire school for a single student, regardless of cost?
The main reason is obliviousness to costs, coupled with a feeling of obligation to rural communities that want their children to have a neighborhood school just like city kids.
But Japan's sometimes rigid bureaucracy can also be a factor.
In Daiki's case, the neighboring town operates an elementary school just 20 minutes away.
But the authorities say that because that school falls under a different administrative region, it is inconceivable that Daiki go there.
Income Distributed Too Equitably
''It might be less costly, and we would be happy to make such an arrangement if it were possible,'' said Tadashi Michibayashi, an official in the Enzan board of education.
''But we in the administration have to draw the line somewhere.''
Of the various elements of egalitarianism, Japan is particularly proud of its even distribution of income.
The richest third of the population in Japan enjoys a total income three times as great as that of the poorest third -- compared with more than five times as much in the United States.
Several global studies have found that an egalitarian distribution of income helps promote economic growth within a country.
But by most counts Japan takes it too far.
Japan relies on 65 percent marginal tax rates -- its tax system is among the most progressive in the world -- and Japanese companies suppress income differentials by paying employees according to seniority rather than merit.
The tax rates and corporate practices reflect a psychology of egalitarianism, many say, that has tended to suppress entrepreneurship and hold back the most talented sector of the population.

''And he gave me an answer I'll never forget.
He said: 'It wouldn't be democratic.'
And I thought, gee, these people define democracy very differently.''
Gaining Consensus, Respecting 'Wa'
More broadly, Japan seems troubled by economic changes that are beneficial overall but that make losers out of some people.
Creating losers would upset the society's ''wa,'' or harmony, a value that has been central to Japanese society at least since Prince Shotoku in 604 proclaimed a constitution decreeing ''Wa must be respected.''
The emphasis on wa often impresses visitors, but it also results in paralysis.
Japan has difficulty carrying out changes that benefit the majority but that are vigorously opposed by a small group of prospective losers.
''Japan is a society of consensus, and as long as 30 percent of the population holds out against a decision, the Government will not act,'' said Yoshio Hatano, a former Ambassador to the United Nations.
The tensions between the United States and Japan thus seem to arise not just from Tokyo's political paralysis but more fundamentally from a set of enormously different attitudes and values, not just about economics but about life itself.
''We are at two ends of the spectrum, the U.S. and Japan,'' said Masaru Yoshitomi, one of Japan's leading economists.
Mr. Yoshitomi noted that Japan's egalitarianism runs so deep that when schoolchildren take part in Sports Day activities, the prizes often go not just to the winners of the races but to absolutely every child who takes part.
He suggested that this takes equality too far, breeding cohesion but suppressing the excellence that drives a modern economy.
''There are no outstanding people in Japan,'' Mr. Yoshitomi said, only partly joking, ''and that has to change.''
MARK FALLS.
The nation's largest gay and lesbian church filed suit today against a Chicago television station, accusing the station of breaking its agreement to broadcast an infomercial produced by the church because the station considered the advertisement too controversial.
Leaders of the church, the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, believe the station, WGN-TV, which is seen nationally when it is fed by satellite to cable systems around the country, rejected the infomercial ''based on their views that this is not appropriate content for those stations,'' said a lawyer for the church, Christopher Wolf.
''I think those are code words for homophobia and for antigay discrimination.''
Church officials saw it in part as a counterweight to advertising by conservative Christian groups, including recent full-page newspaper advertisements with people who say they are former homosexuals who ''overcame'' their sexual orientation.
''We just wanted to make our voice heard against the overwhelming onslaught of people using the media to say how bad gay people are,'' said the pastor, the Rev.
Michael Piazza.
''We wanted mostly to reach out to lesbian and gay teen-agers but also people living in rural areas, to tell them there is this possibility that you can be gay and Christian, there is this possibility that you are a child of God.''

Charles J. Sennet, senior counsel for the Tribune Company, which owns WGN-TV, declined to comment on the lawsuit or to explain the network's version of events, saying the company would respond in court.
Mr. Rozansky's version of events differs markedly from the church's.
''I think what they're trying to do is make this a political issue and a slam against gay rights,'' Mr. Rozansky said.
''They are jumping to conclusions and making accusations that are not appropriate and do not logically follow the facts.''

The 30-minute infomercial begins with a montage of antigay demonstrators and speeches by televangelists.
The bulk of the advertisement is devoted to happy church members, both gay and straight, children playing and the church's inclusive philosophy.
Mr. Rozansky said that infomercials that touch on sensitive subjects are routinely turned down by television stations.
He said the other stations, including the Discovery Channel, Black Entertainment Television and Odyssey, had turned the commercial down for varying reasons, including length, religious content and controversial subject matter.
It did, however, break a run of three straight declines, closing at 8,371.97.
''The market is having to deal with some crosscurrents,'' said John H. Shaughnessy, chief strategist at Advest Group.

The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks, which has had a run-up of nearly 20 percent in the last couple of weeks, made a strong comeback in the afternoon but still could not eke out a gain.
Clare W. Zempel, chief strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, was among those regarding the general market advance of recent weeks as more likely to be a building block than a bear-market trap for the unwary.
He pointed to the decline in short-term interest rates in the United States and signs of economic stability in the Far East that he said ''strongly suggest that the worst'' of this year's stock decline is past.
As for Brazil, Mr. Zempel said it would probably ''muddle through.''

Although foreign economic and financial turmoil has in the last 15 months supplanted Washington's economic reports as the dominant market influence, the Government's first estimate of gross domestic product for the third quarter, to be announced tomorrow, will be closely watched for signs that the economy's slowdown might be accelerating, said Rosanne M. Cahn, equity economist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Many analysts already expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again, perhaps as early as mid-November.
A second focal point will be the Labor Department's release today of the employment cost index, a quarterly measure of wage pressure that, like the figures on gross domestic product, has implications for corporate profits.
Rising technology stocks yesterday included Sun Microsystems, up 3 1/16, to 56 11/16, Dell Computer and Cisco Systems, each up 2 1/8, to 64 5/8 and 62 7/8, respectively, and Sun Microsystems, up 3 1/16, to 56 11/16.
Oil stocks were mixed, with Mobil down 3/4 at $72 7/8 after reporting a 45 percent earnings decline, a bit less than expected.
DuPont was the Dow's biggest loser, slumping 2 11/16, to 56 7/8, apparently reflecting a negative discussion of the company's prospects in The Wall Street Journal.

There has been a backlash at the network and the fan level, said Jay Larkin, Showtime senior vice president for sports/event programming.
The fans have really gotten fed up with all the mismatches with no end in sight.
And we've started demanding better fights from the promoters.
Beginning this weekend with the Hamed-McCullough bout, boxing's hit parade will continue through Dec. 19 when Floyd Mayweather Jr., the newly crowned W.B.C.
junior-lightweight champion, fights Angel Manfredy.
The undercard for that show will feature a match between the up-and-coming heavyweights David Tua and Hasim Rahman, on HBO.
On Nov. 13 Ricardo Lopez, the W.B.C.
strawweight champion, will meet Rosendo Alvarez in a rematch in Las Vegas on Showtime.
The next night, Roy Jones Jr., who holds the World Boxing Association and W.B.C.
light-heavyweight titles, will take on Otis Grant at 168 pounds at Foxwoods Resorts Casino in Connecticut, also on HBO.

The agreement should bring in $90 billion that wealthy nations said would provide the framework for a system to protect emerging markets from the turbulence that has ravaged their economies for more than a year.
Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, is considered the most likely candidate for such aid.
In a news conference here today, Mr. Malan said the amount that Brazil would borrow from the I.M.F.
He noted that Brazil, unlike South Korea, Indonesia, Russia, and other victims of the financial firestorms over the last year, has not devalued its currency, the real, or defaulted on debt.
''It's not simple to define the amount, because there is no immediate need for the money,'' Mr. Malan said.
''What there is is a bet that it's possible to re-establish confidence, and the greatest demonstration of success of an operation like this will be precisely a low use of the resources that are made available to us.''
''We are not talking about a rescue operation,'' Mr. Malan said.
The cost of protecting the currency from devaluation, however, has been soaring interest rates, which make investments denominated in reals more attractive but make loans prohibitively costly to many Brazilian businesses, choking economic growth and increasing joblessness.
In a sobering reminder of the impact of high interest rates, the auto parts industry in the Sao Paulo industrial area announced yesterday that it would be laying off 30,000 workers, of a work force that now totals 80,000.
The surge in bank lending has not been enough to offset entirely the decline in the sale of corporate I.O.U.'s.
New offerings of commercial paper have fallen by nearly $20 billion in recent weeks; on top of that, the sale of high-yield corporate bonds, sometimes called junk bonds, has almost disappeared.
These sales normally raise $20 billion a month for companies that lack top-of-the-line credit ratings.

Still, the rise in bank lending ''is somewhat alleviating what would otherwise be a severe credit crunch, and the question is, How long will it keep doing that?''
The great hope is that the global financial crisis will lift early next year.
's, which pay higher interest rates than the Treasuries they are investing in now, will cease to be so nervous and start buying again.
Until the crisis lifts, companies can somehow get by, everyone hopes, either by postponing projects or by borrowing from banks -- if not all the money they want, then at least some of it.
But there is a concern that, even in these final weeks of 1998, the rise in bank lending may be less than meets the eye, and less a support of the national economy than the Federal Reserve's statistics might indicate.

Rather than signaling a flow of new loans, much of the lending appears to be borrowers' drawing on existing lines of credit established months ago.
What's more, while bank loans for general business activity are rising much faster than in the first half of the year, real estate lending is weak.
BANK real estate loans are rising much more slowly now than in the first half of the year.
Home mortgages are flowing fast enough, but loans for the purchase or construction of office buildings, plants and other commercial structures are not.
Banks like to sell to others the real estate loans they originate, and thus limit the amount of risk they bear in the event of defaults.
That is easy for home mortgages, because Federal agencies are big purchasers of these loans.
But commercial real estate loans must be sold into a market of private investors, and investors are not buying these commercial bank loans.
''Applications for commercial mortgages are way up, but the banks are not increasing what they have on the books, not yet,'' said Dennis Yeskey, regional managing director of real estate services for Deloitte & Touche.
A similar ceiling is likely to limit the growth of bank lending for standard business activity, despite the recent surge in such lending, because banks do not like to carry huge loans on their books.
So they syndicate corporate loans, parceling out portions of a big loan to other banks.
And loan syndication is not rising.
''The banks are not going to take that kind of risk,'' said James Davis, president of the Loan Pricing Corporation, which monitors bank lending.
And that is why the banks, for all the current surge in corporate lending, are not likely to sustain the American economy through a financial crisis that lasts past January.

''Now, money is redistributing itself among all financial markets.
If people start getting nervous again, it may reverse.''
In the stock market, however, that view is still widely if not universally held.
Moreover, there is little doubt that the Fed's decision to cut rates in late September and again last month has been vitally significant to the stock market's rally.
''The key thing is that we now have financial leadership worldwide, led by the Fed,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. in Boston.

First, the data.
This year, as in most other years, prices in some individual industries are falling.
Energy prices have dropped almost 10 percent the last year.
Commodity prices have dropped by about 20 percent the last year.
The prices of raw materials, clothes and other imported goods have also declined, partly in response to the economic collapse of Southeast Asia.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But other prices are more than making up for the slack.
Producer prices, excluding energy and food, are rising about 1 percent a year.
Consumer prices are rising by about 2 percent a year.
These rates are small.
But they are nowhere near negative.
Look to the labor market, which drives the formation of prices.
Over the last year, wages and salaries have been rising about 4 percent a year.
Nothing in economic logic or history suggests that wages will suddenly reverse course.
Indeed, even if recession strikes, wages will almost certainly continue to rise, as they have in every recent downturn.
And if wages do not fall, prices will almost certainly not fall either.
Labor costs typically account for two-thirds of the cost of producing goods and services.
In general, wages and prices move up and down together.
They can move in opposite directions, however, in times of rapid gains in productivity.
If, say, workers are given the tools to churn out 5 percent more each hour, then the extra output would yield enough new revenue to allow the company to pay workers 5 percent more even without raising prices.
The company could even cut prices a few percent and still have enough extra revenue to pass along to workers as higher wages.

But productivity is now rising by less than 2 percent a year.
That provides no room for prices to fall if wages continue to rise anywhere near their current 4 percent clip.
As Prof. Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard points out, ''Only in the extreme case of the economy falling into a deep depression like that of the 1930's would the level of prices actually begin a sustained decline.''
Nor are prices falling in any other industrialized economy except Japan.
Throughout Europe, prices are rising very slowly.
In developing countries, inflation rules nearly everywhere outside of China.
Even in the decimated economies of Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand, prices are rising rapidly.
So why the frenzy over deflation?
Robert Solow, Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, attributes some of the chatter about deflation to analytical confusion.
In virtually every industrialized country, the official task of the central bank is to achieve price stability, or roughly zero inflation.
At least since the reign of Paul A. Volcker in the 1980's, Fed chairmen have been measured by their ability to get inflation down.
With prices rising by only 2 percent a year, Mr. Greenspan has come close to victory.
But Mr. Solow observes, ''if average prices are not changing, then, to a rough approximation, half the prices must be falling, while the other half must be rising'' in order to keep the price index relatively level.
To invoke the specter of specific price cuts for oil, apparel and computers as harbingers of deflation is, by this argument, to confuse economics with algebra.
The United States has not experienced deflation since the 1930's.
But though economic historians continue to debate the underlying cause of the Great Depression, they do not dispute the simple proposition that deflation was then, and will almost certainly be in the future, a monetary event.
Translation: prices can only continue to fall if people are given fewer and fewer dollars to spend on good and services.
This is the flip side of the commonplace proposition that inflation can rage only if people are given more and more dollars to spend by the Fed.
It is inconceivable that the Fed would make the same mistake today.
If, as Mr. Greenspan fears, deflation forces drift ashore from Asia, the Fed has an ironclad remedy.
It needs only to step on the monetary pedal, as it has already begun to do cautiously by lowering interest rates.
There are lots of economic forces to fear.
Recession.
Inequality.
Productivity slowdown.
In each case, living standards are at risk and government cannot perfectly anticipate what to do and when to act.
But deflation isn't worth fretting about unless you believe that the United States will suffer a once-in-a-century catastrophe and the Fed will play dumb.
''The odds slightly favor an easing at the next meeting,'' said Bill Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.

Mr. Greenspan did not address the general economic outlook or interest rate policy in his speech today, delivered from Washington by video conference to a meeting of the Securities Industry Association in Florida.
The Fed had cited wariness among lenders and jittery conditions in the financial markets when explaining its last rate cut, on Oct. 15.
During the late summer and early fall, investors around the world rushed away from all but the safest securities and also demanded high levels of liquidity, or the ability to sell at an instant's notice, a development that is ''virtually unprecedented'' and ''startling'' at a time when the economy is strong, inflation is dormant and interest rates are not rising, Mr. Greenspan said today.
But in recent weeks the stock market has marched steadily upward after its precipitous drop during the summer.
More important from the Fed's perspective, there has also been some narrowing of the gap between interest rates on United States Treasury bonds, the worldwide benchmark for investment safety, and bonds issued by companies and other governments.

''It is, of course, plausible that the current episode of investor fright will dissipate, and yield spreads and liquidity premiums will soon fall into more normal ranges,'' Mr. Greenspan said in the speech to the Securities Industry Association.
''Indeed, we are already seeing significant signs of some reversals.''

His answer was that ''when events become too complex and move too rapidly, as appears to be the case today, human beings become demonstrably less able to cope.''
In the financial world, that leads to ''disengagement,'' he said, and ultimately to falling prices.
''That leaves us with the challenge: How can we harness burgeoning international financial flows in a manner that does not strain human evaluation capacities?''
He argued against putting controls on international capital flows, a strategy that is being seriously considered by developing nations and one already adopted by Malaysia.
He noted that governments, central banks and the organizations like the International Monetary Fund were taking steps to develop international banking standards and make sure that investors have more financial information about the countries in which they are investing.
''Doubtless, tomorrow's complexities will dwarf even today's,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
''It is, thus, all the more important to recognize that 21st-century financial regulation is going to increasingly have to rely on private counterparty surveillance to achieve safety and soundness.''
According to Christopher Goldthwait, the senior official of the United States Department of Agriculture who helped negotiate the food accord, the Russians will run out of wheat before their next harvest without American aid.

''We project they will run short some time in the month of July,'' Mr. Goldthwait said in an interview.
Even now Russia is facing regional shortages.
Russia's Agriculture Ministry has reported shortages in 22 of the nation's 89 regions.
Russia's disastrous harvest -- the worst in 45 years -- is just part of the reason.
The tendency of the nation's regions to go their own way, lax government management and Russia's financial crisis have turned a difficult situation into a desperate one.
Many grain producing regions have been hoarding their supply.
The collapse of the banking system and fuel shortages have also delayed the sale and distribution of what food is available to regions that do not produce grain.
''Distribution is a big problem,'' said Viktor F. Lishchenko, a leading agricultural specialist.
''The nation is vast and many local governors practically do not let the grain out of their borders.''
Quantity is not the only problem.
The quality of Russia's store of grain is uneven, diminishing its value for making bread or raising livestock.
The decline in domestic food production has been aggravated by a sharp decline in imports, another consequence of the plummeting value of the nation's currency.
But imports have fallen to a fraction of that and what foreign food is being shipped in is being sold at skyrocketing prices.

''We think the situation is critical,'' said Margarita Plonikova, Moscow representative of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Even ordinary Russians have felt the pinch.
Even before the financial crisis, the annual consumption of meat has declined to about 95 pounds a person, less than half of American levels.
And since the crisis, Russia's pasta factories have been working overtime, a sign that Russians are changing their diet.
Food is not the only problem.
The Russian Government is also struggling to keep its citizens supplied with heat and power.
As the food crisis has grown, the Kremlin only begrudgingly recognized the seriousness of the situation.
Under today's accord, the United States will supply 3.1 million metric tons of food.
That supply includes 1.5 million tons of wheat, which is being provided free.
Another 1.5 million tons of feed grain, meat, dry milk, soybeans, rice, corn and other commodities is being bought by Russia under extremely favorable terms: a 20-year loan at a nominal interest rate.
The United States is also providing 100,000 tons of food to private relief groups for distribution to Russia's needy.

The Russians intend to sell much of the food at home at market rates.
With corruption rampant in Russia, the United States wants to prevent Russian businessmen from raking off the profits.
Instead, the Russians are obliged to use the proceeds to pay pensions and finance other social programs.
The United States is footing the $260 million bill for sending the different shipments for Russia.
Relief organizations, meanwhile, are mounting their own campaigns to buy and distribute food.
Still, American officials said that the food aid may not be sufficient and may need to be increased.
''This is a question that we have left open,'' Mr. Goldthwait said.
''We will continue to assess whether there or not there is a need for additional commodities.''
Correction: November 10, 1998, Tuesday Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about United States food aid for Russia misstated the terms.

It is not buying food worth $625 million.

They may be abating for a while.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Securities Industry Association on Thursday what many analysts have been observing: Investors and lenders seem to be calming down after weeks of turmoil, easing the threat of a credit crunch and reducing market volatility.
Some Wall Streeters took his remarks to mean that there is now less chance of further interest rate cuts, since the Fed explained the last round by citing investor jitters and the need for market liquidity.
But an economic case for a rate cut gathered strength when the October employment report showed the economy gradually cooling, job growth slowing and wages up only slightly.
Now with 40,000 members in 35 countries, Slow Food also has a manifesto.

In the first concrete sign that recession in Brazil may be slowing Argentina's economy, leading auto makers here have temporarily idled plants and are reporting a drop in car sales.
Argentina has been one of the strongest economic performers in Latin America this year, with an expected growth rate of 5.3 percent, down from 8.2 percent last year.
But while Government officials are optimistically predicting 4.8 percent growth in 1999, recent cutbacks in auto factory man-hours and shrinking auto exports to Brazil are seen as suggesting a much weaker economy ahead.
Martin Redrado, a leading economist and former aide to President Carlos Saul Menem, said that Brazil's interest rates, currently averaging 42 percent, were curtailing car exports there.
The key question is whether the financial rescue package from the International Monetary Fund for Brazil will be sufficient, Mr. Redrado said, then quickly adding, ''I say no because the interest rates are eating up potential savings, and a Brazilian recession will clearly have an effect on trade flows from Argentina.''

That may already be the case, at least judging from auto industry figures announced last week.
Manufacturers reported turning out 40,000 vehicles in October, a 15 percent decrease from the month before and 27 percent below a year earlier.

Still, Argentine auto executives say they will produce about the same number of vehicles this year as last -- 450,000 or so -- with nearly half of them going to Brazil.

But with 20,000 cars sitting in sales lots, and showroom prices declining as much as 10 percent, General Motors, Chrysler, Fiat, Renault and Volkswagen have reduced the work hours of their employees and suspended production in their Argentine plants for several weeks this month.
G.M., for example, is halting production at its factory in Rosario for two weeks, effectively cutting wages for 1,600 workers.
The slowdown in car sales comes as beef prices and other Argentine agricultural exports are falling in price, in part also due to a slowdown in sales to Brazil, the buyer of 30 percent of Argentina's exports.
Nevertheless, Government and private economists are offering a broad range of competing predictions.
Most of those from Wall Street firms estimate that the Argentine economy will grow 1 to 3 percent in 1999, well below Government expectations.
Both Government and private economists here are expressing more confidence in the Brazilian economy than just a few weeks ago, and stock markets around the region are rebounding strongly.
The hurricane that has ravaged Honduras and Nicaragua may also strengthen farm export prices, they say.
Roque Fernandez, the Economy Minister, told reporters recently that economic growth would be virtually flat in the second half of this year.
He added that ''we should start to feel a recovery in the first four months'' of 1999.
But business executives are expressing caution about the world economy and how developments in Asia, Brazil and Russia may reverberate here.
''Japan is very slow in approving its reforms,'' said Jorge Di Fiori, president of the Argentine Chamber of Commerce.
''We have to wait and see if the Brazilian Congress passes the adjustment package, and 1999 is an election year here and that always provokes concerns.''
The Brazilian Government, which recently pledged to slash discretionary spending by $7 billion in an urgent attempt to bolster its economic credibility, has released new budget figures showing that the true reduction will run about half the promised amount.
Total spending would actually increase next year, according to the latest figures, which were announced on Monday.
The package was crucial for Brazil to qualify for a backup loan from the International Monetary Fund and other sources, including the United States Government, and to counter a $30 billion hemorrhage from Brazil's foreign reserves, which have fallen to about $42 billion.
The Clinton Administration is concerned that a default in Brazil -- the world's ninth-largest economy and home to more than half of South America's 300 million people -- could set off repercussions around Latin America, the destination of some 20 percent of United States exports.

Soon after it was released, the Government conceded that the economy, instead of growing, would shrink by 1 percent next year, and some independent economists predict a more severe recession, noting that high interest rates are choking off the supply of capital for industry.
Compared with this year's spending, the Government's budget for next year shows some $3.8 billion in actual savings on discretionary expenses, with the budget dropping to $29.8 billion.
The original budget for next year projected $36.4 billion on discretionary expenses, which include a range of programs, including land purchases for agrarian reform and to extend basic sanitation.
But the Brazilian Government's overall budget, because of court-ordered increases in salaries and benefits, will increase $1.9 billion next year, to $154.2 billion, despite its claims to austerity.
Though some economists, like Paulo Rabello de Castro, of the Rio-based Atlantic Institute, say they are confident that Brazil is on the road to righting itself, they appear discouraged by its current response to the crisis.
The Government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is already fighting skepticism abroad, after he announced another austerity package a year ago, only to drop it as elections neared.
''When you're in a situation like Brazil is in, you usually have to do more than enough to win back confidence,'' Mr. Castro said.

''What I want to see is down the road,'' Mr. Barros said.
''What happens after three or six months as the immediate pressures recede, and people say, 'Okay, Mr. President, why don't you revoke this or that austerity measure?'
''
And the presidents of the House and Senate agreed to shower maximum benefits on the 594 lawmakers who will attend a special session to debate Government cutbacks and tax increases, paying them $47,000 for three months -- a sum that the majority of Brazilian workers, making less than $330 a month, would need at least 11 years to earn.

As the Brazilian Government hoists the banner of austerity and finishes negotiations for an I.M.F.-led standby loan, the gap between the Government's calls for sacrifice and its spending practices appears striking.
Brazil is not the only country whose leaders spend lavishly on furnishings or perks, but some leading economists, like Paulo Rabello de Castro of the Rio de Janeiro-based Atlantic Institute, say that systematic Government overspending is so serious here that it lies at the heart of Brazil's financial crisis.
An undisciplined Government soaks up credit, they say, choking growth of the private sector.
A review of purchase orders from every branch of Government, obtained by The New York Times from a member of the Brazilian Congress concerned about excessive spending, along with official budget figures and spending regulations, suggest that the Government has taken minimal steps to control spending, despite the crisis that has been rolling toward this nation since last autumn, when the Central Bank doubled interest rates in reaction to the crisis in Thailand.
In category after category, Government spending has gone up this year.
Salaries and benefits in the federal judiciary were up 42.8 percent by this August over last, rising to $4.7 billion from $3.2 billion.
At a time of tax increases and pension cutbacks, press reports of loose spending are drawing angry criticism.
''Investments are being cut,'' Sylka dos Santos Carneiro, a reader outraged at a report of Government spending on travel, wrote to the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil.
''Spending on health, education and other 'unimportant things' is being cut.
The country has lost its reason!''
Augusto Carvalho, an opposition Congressman and longtime watchdog of Government waste, said senior officials should set an example of restraint for junior workers.
''If we're going to the I.M.F.
for $30 billion, it's the Brazilian people who are co-signing that loan,'' Mr. Carvalho said.
''The Government shouldn't spend for anything that's not absolutely necessary.''
''It doesn't represent a great savings,'' Ms. Costim said in an interview here.
''But at a time when we're asking people to make sacrifices, we have to make the effort.''

While the gesture may be praiseworthy, the problem runs deeper.
Brazilian civil servants who travel, unlike their American counterparts, are not reimbursed mainly for receipts but given a generous allowance for each day away, a system common in many countries.
A senior Brazilian official visiting Washington, for example, collects $280 a day whether he stays at a five-star hotel or at the ambassador's residence.
An American official on the same trip would collect no more than $168 a day.
The Brazilian stipends, keyed to seniority levels, can add up to a kind of supplemental salary.
The executive branch, though, is reviewing major Government contracts and has ordered each agency to come up with ways to trim spending, she said.
David Fleischer, a professor at the Federal University of Brasilia and the president of the Brazilian chapter of Transparency International, said that after October's national elections, the Government cut the budget for auditing and tax collection, citing the need for austerity.
''It's not even shooting yourself in the foot,'' he said.
''It's shooting yourself in the head.''
Others have pointed out that the $7 billion in budget cuts, announced as part of a $23.5 billion austerity package recently, are not all based on actual savings, but on cuts to a pre-election budget for 1999.
That budget counted on 4 percent economic growth, instead of the 1 percent shrinkage the Government now forecasts for 1999.
In that vein, the President of the Supreme Court, Jose Celso de Mello Filho, boasted of slashing 20 percent from the court's 1999 budget.
''It's in, out.''
Supreme Court justices have also been lobbying for higher salaries, which could reach $18,000 a month.
The new salary would apply to the 24 sitting and retired justices.
At $9,150 a month, the justices already earn more than the President of Brazil, who collects $7,200 a month.
Saying it was ''a very difficult time'' for Brazil, Mr. Mello said he might argue against an increase at a coming meeting.
But Mr. Fleischer and other analysts suggested the justices would probably get their increases later.
''It's more smoke and mirrors for the World Bank, the I.M.F.
''After the I.M.F.
signs off on the loan, it will go back to normal and they'll probably pass the increase.''
But the tribunal itself has also come under fire.
So far this year, seven of its eight ministers, who are political appointees, have spent $640,000 on foreign travel, collecting $358,000 in cash.
''It has to fulfill them.''
Once again, ''investors seem to be discriminating among companies,'' said Daniel Knight, portfolio manager at Columbine Capital Services in Colorado Springs.
''Lower P-E stocks are outperforming high P-E stocks,'' he added, referring to the relationship of prices to earnings.

One prominent speculative casualty was Entremed, which dropped 7 3/4 a share, to 24 7/8, after The Wall Street Journal reported on problems that scientists have had in replicating one of the company's experimental anti-cancer compounds.
By contrast, Earthweb built on its spectacular Wednesday debut by surging another 20 9/16 , to 69 1/4, nearly quintupling in two trading sessions from its initial price of 14 a share.
Oil shares jumped on the assumption that an attack against Iraq would jeopardize at least some Mideast oil supplies.
Chevron, up 3 1/8 a share, to 83, and Exxon, up 2 9/16 , to 72 13/16 , were the Dow's most important performers; without them, the Dow -- with only 10 gainers out of 30 -- would have declined.
Most analysts still expect the Fed to make another cut in short-term interest rates -- and the case for it might have been bolstered a bit with the Labor Department's report that first-time claims for jobless benefits climbed last week to the highest level in four months.
But conviction was missing in the market yesterday.

''Our bond markets have been the beneficiary'' of the refuge demand, said Ken Anderson, who helps manage $14.5 billion in bonds at Evergreen Asset Management in Purchase, N.Y.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.25 percent, from 5.29 percent on Tuesday.
Demand for the dollar was also helped by doubts that Japan's latest plan to increase spending and cut taxes will succeed in lifting its economy out of its worst recession in half a century.
A stronger dollar increases the returns international investors receive on United States assets like bonds, once the proceeds switch to their home currencies.
''A very important debate has begun, sparked by the general realization that you cannot leave people unprotected before the global market,'' said Anthony Giddens, the director of the London School of Economics.
''There is a will to recognize the need for some new governance of the world economy.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The question of just what that new governance should be is creating a world of unusual intellectual flux, one comparable to the post-1945 era in its quest for some overarching design for equitable development.
Just as the development of the New Deal and the European welfare state rescued industrial capitalism from its interwar collapse, so a similar and equally critical quest has now begun at a global level for cushions to the harsher effects of electronic capitalism.
Prominent economists have suggested a global taxation on currency speculation, the establishment of a second United Nations Security Council for economic affairs that would act to avert disaster in the economic field, limits on international flows of capital, and setting target zones for exchange rates.
But such steps, which have fairly wide support in Europe, tend to provoke deep suspicion in the United States, although the danger that further volatility could lead to spreading protectionism and possible political upheavals is widely recognized in Washington.
At the center of the disagreement between Americans and Europeans lies the nature of today's instantaneous world.
Has this new global society amounted to an electronic energizer, as the Clinton Administration has tended to argue, a revolutionary generator of new wealth, new job possibilities and greater freedom?
Or has the brave new world, as many European intellectuals have insisted, been no more than a slick reincarnation of the unfettered capitalism of the 19th century, using new technology to atomize societies, isolate the poor and advance a new ideology of exploitation upheld by an ever-wealthier, on-line global oligarchy?
''We live in an increasingly unequal world,'' said Elmar Altwater, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin, ''and what we have now understood is that this will continue as long as there is no political correction.
Incomes based on labor simply have not grown in real terms, even as income based on the global application of capital has soared.
What is needed is more political intervention.''
Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economist and adviser to the French Prime Minister, said: ''If there are systematic losers from today's global economy, we could be overwhelmed.
A way must be found to bring the Frankenstein of deregulated global financial markets under control.''
Such references to ''Frankenstein'' in the same breath as ''markets'' makes many American economists grimace.
After all, the United States under Bill Clinton has seen the creation of millions of new jobs, a vigorous economy that derived 30 percent of its growth from international expansion and, until recent volatility, consistently soaring share prices.
In Europe, by contrast, high unemployment and increasingly strained social security systems have bolstered a far darker vision, popularized by a best seller called ''The Economic Horror'' by the French writer Viviane Forrestier.
It has sold more than 310,000 copies and been translated into 17 languages.
''Shame should be quoted on the stock exchange for it is an important element of profit,'' Ms. Forrestier writes in one of the milder phrases of her uniformly bleak catalogue of contemporary devastation.

Pierre Bourdieu, a French intellectual with a large and passionate following, a man who is perhaps the nearest figure the country now has to a Jean-Paul Sartre, has made his name with relentless and more sophisticated attacks against what Europeans and Latin Americans generally call ultraliberalism, that is, unfettered free-market orthodoxy.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
A dapper, soft-spoken man, Mr. Bourdieu argues that the central aim of ''the pure logic of the market'' has been to weaken every collective group -- the nation itself, the state, labor unions, cooperatives, associations -- to install what he calls a worldwide ''reign of absolute flexibility'' in which international capital and multinational corporations dictate terms of employment and wages.
''Ours is a Darwinian world of insecurity and stress, where the permanent threat of unemployment creates a permanent state of precariousness,'' he has written.
The quest for more equitable development has been strengthened in Europe by the arrival of governments whose intellectual inspiration comes from the left: Tony Blair in London, Lionel Jospin in Paris, Massimo D'Alema in Rome and Gerhard Schroder in Bonn.
It has also been reinforced by the ravages that the rapid, often herdlike daily movement of money across frontiers has recently inflicted on such societies as Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil.
The abrupt unmasking of Russia's sham capitalism -- with its ''stock market,'' its ''financiers'' and its privatized companies beside zero regulation, almost zero tax collection, rampant asset-stripping and a general absence of the rule of law -- has also brought home the danger of exporting a modern capitalist market economy to a society unready for it.
Reviewing this and other fiascos, James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, said last month, ''We have to learn to have a debate where mathematics will not dominate humanity.''
Mr. Clinton, too, has noted recently that a quarter of the world's population now lives in countries in a recession.
He has begun to talk about the need to ''lift the lives of ordinary people.''
Still, what form of regulation the market needs and in what degree remain matters of sharp dispute.
Mr. Blair talks about the ''rebirth of progressive politics,'' by which he seems to mean that the state has an active role to play after the Thatcher years but one that is highly disciplined and ultimately aimed at giving everyone a stake in the national economy.
Mr. Clinton has proposed a ''third way,'' between capitalism and socialism.
The term third way is not new, however, and has been applied during this century to everything from German social democracy through Yugoslav economic experiments to attempted reforms in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev era.
What both Mr. Blair's and Mr. Clinton's formulations have in common, though, is the notion that highly disciplined public entities can bring the necessary balance to market forces.
So far, Western governments have instructed the World Bank to direct extra funds to ''the most vulnerable groups in society'' and provided an extra $90 billion to the International Monetary Fund to be used to try to pre-empt crises.
But these are essentially short-term Band-Aids.
More sweeping measures are certain to meet resistance.
''The last thing the world needs is an economic Security Council at the United Nations,'' said Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs.
''If you really want to undermine confidence, that would do it.''
He added that limits on flows of capital through controls or regulations should be approached warily.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Paul Krugman of M.I.T.
has argued in The New Republic, however, that pressure to constrain or limit international capital flows seems certain to grow if the response to crises continues to be governed by the need to ''mollify market sentiment.''
Mr. Krugman says that cutting interest rates is what is really needed to revive these economies and give poor people in countries like Brazil a better chance to make their way.
Such limits on capital flows would be a body blow to the spirit of American capitalism, which has been so buoyant and dominant since the cold war's end.
This capitalism has been revolutionary, introducing millions of people to stock-holding both directly and through mutual funds.
But capitalism elsewhere has also had a much crueler face as rising poverty rates in Asia, Latin America and Russia show.
The problem, he said, is that that is no longer the case.
Drawing on the model of several imperial villas in Kyoto, the garden incorporates motifs designed to foster personal enlightenment and reflection.
''It's authentic from the point of view of it being a genuine response to the environment, the North Shore of Long Island,'' said Mr. Morrell.
''We're not trying to bulldoze it and erect Mount Fuji.''

Following the land's natural topography, the route to the garden is up a hill, through native beech and maple.
The climb, Mr. Morrell said, represents in some measure an ascent inside one's spiritual self.
At the top of the hill is a gate that marks the beginning of the garden proper, and Mr. Morrell reminds visitors that they are part of its natural totality -- that any line drawn between human beings and their environment is illusory.
''To see it only as a fragment of experience is self-centered.''
The major features of the garden are a pond dotted with lily pads that is fed by a waterfall, and a teahouse that Mr. Humes imported from Japan in 1960, after a trip that inspired him to create the garden.
To reach the pond and teahouse, one descends the hill on a series of stepping stones.
As does the path of life, this path twists and turns.
The stones are surrounded by pools of pebbles, and the temptation is to keep one's feet on the stones alone.
That can be tricky, as many of the stones can only accommodate one foot.
The result is a reflexive and metaphorical taking of one step at a time.
At various points the path diverges into miniature cul-de-sacs, with boundaries marked by groupings of moss-covered rocks and semi-circles of sawn branches a few inches high protruding from the ground.
These areas may be viewed either as symbolic dead ends or as opportunities to pause for a survey of the surroundings -- reminders to stop and smell the roses, as it were, except that here, there are none.
The garden has come to a momentary rest itself, having recently undergone extensive refinishing.
A lack of money, staff and public interest made for an uncertain future.

The conservancy raised $175,000 for renovations, mainly for rejuvenating the waterfall, dredging the pond and erecting a sturdier barrier wall.
The next goal, as yet unscheduled, will be to erect a visitors' center, complete with a sorely needed restroom.
Financing remains a challenge; the staff is almost entirely volunteer and the garden is open only on weekends for half of the year from 11:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. (this year's season ended on Oct. 18).
''What we'd like to do is develop a local board that will take over what we've been doing,'' Ms. Adezio said.
In the meantime, in addition to its natural beauty, the garden offers activities like classes in yoga, tai chi and flower arranging, known as ikebana.
The intricate ritual of correctly kneeling on tatami mats, arranging utensils, folding and unfolding napkins and ladling the tea was a bit daunting for one visitor who had volunteered to serve as honored guest.
''I don't know what I'm doing,'' she said.
''That's a very enlightened statement,'' Mr. Morrell responded.

There are also appearances by practitioners of sui-zen, or ''blowing meditation,'' who play a bamboo flute called the shakuhachi.
The practice originated in Buddhist temples as a way of achieving enlightenment by concentrating on the simple act of breathing.
The sound of the flute, wafting through the still garden, is melancholy but not mournful.
''It's about the sound; it's not the notes,'' said Darius Kaufmann, a shakuhachi player who is a music graduate of Queens College.
''The notes are almost ludicrously simple, but you can play each one an almost infinite number of ways.''
Clad in a black kimono, ensconced in the teahouse, Mr. Kaufmann explained that he was not performing for the public so much as conducting a personal meditation.
''It's an inner experience -- I find that the trees and the sky are inside the shakuhachi.
I just let the music take me away.''
With its blend of West and East, the stroll garden is an accommodation of two very different cultures.
Significantly, Mr. Morrell has found that recurring tensions between the United States and Japan are not usually mirrored in the attitudes of the patrons.
Japanese visitors generally approve of the garden, but, he added, ''Some of them are a little uncomfortable with a Westerner practicing their art form.''
After an hour or so in the tranquillity of the garden, the temptation is to attribute the infrequency of such remarks to the spirit of the place, as expressed in a sign at the entrance.
In English and Japanese, it reads, ''May peace prevail on Earth.''

Re ''Brazil Is to Get I.M.F.
Package for $42 Billion'' (front page, Nov. 13):
Negotiations regarding economic aid for Brazil have been emphasizing the need for spending cuts.
Brazil is expected to receive billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund in order to shore up investor confidence.
In fact, the $250 billion internal debt that Brazil has accumulated in recent months is primarily a consequence of high interest rates, which only benefit speculative investments.
Who is paying the bill for this?
The budget cuts proposed by the Brazilian Government will be aimed at social spending, including health care, education, agrarian reform and housing and infrastructure projects.
Last month President Fernando Henrique Cardoso mentioned the possibility of taxing short-term investments, but that has been forgotten.

Aaron Miller ended his streak of 31 games without a goal at 1 minute 8 seconds of the third period, scoring over a sprawled Salo to give the Avalanche a 4-2 lead.
Forsberg, who was fed the puck by Valery Kamensky after winning a draw, beat Salo with a wrist shot from the slot.
The Avalanche is 20-0-7 when Forsberg scores a goal.
But Joe Sakic, the Avalanche captain, restored Colorado's lead 25 seconds later, ricocheting the puck off an unsuspecting Salo.
His absence was conspicuous only because the PAVEL BURE trade discussions have heated up in recent days.

The $41.5 billion economic rescue package that Brazil signed last Friday with the International Monetary Fund seems to have reassured investors interested in the country's long-term prospects.

But the terms of the I.M.F.
deal have added to the concerns of ordinary Brazilians.
They require the Government to carry out a combination of spending cuts and tax increases totaling $84 billion over the next three years, which will squeeze the wallets and pocketbooks of Brazil's estimated 165 million people.
Companies have been laying off employees and families tightening their belts for three months in anticipation of the austerity package announced last week.
Stores are already predicting a disastrous Christmas season, after a decline in retail sales of just over 5 percent in September.
''I think we are already living in a recession, and I don't think the I.M.F.
loan is going to be a solution,'' said Jose Roberto Ramiz, a university physical education professor here.
''It's only a palliative that has to be paid some day, and unfortunately the bill for irresponsibility and incorrect policies is going to be paid with a lot of sacrifice by all of us.''
Government statistics indicate that while agriculture and commerce are also suffering, industry, especially manufacturing and construction, has been the sector hardest hit by the crisis.
''Recent figures I have seen show industry declining about 6 percent on a September-to-September basis, and that is very worrying,'' said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, who was president of the central bank when Brazil negotiated its previous I.M.F.
package in 1983.
''That has a lot of social implications, but the Government is going to have to resist pressures to abandon austerity and plunge ahead.''
Debate here now centers not on whether there will be a recession, but on its strength and duration.

After the I.M.F.
agreement was signed last Friday, though, the Government appears to have changed its tune and now argues that any slump will be brief and relatively gentle.
''The combination of external support with internal reforms will permit Brazil to resume growth during 1999,'' Finance Minister Pedro Malan said in the newspaper O Globo over the weekend.
But Mr. Malan's opinion is a minority one, discounted by most outside the Government as excessively optimistic.
Banking and other private analysts have been predicting that the economy may contract as much as 3 percent in 1999 and shrink again in 2000 unless interest rates decline substantially and the Government proves to be really serious about tackling the huge budget and current-account deficits.

''The truth is that we have a difficult year ahead of us, following a year that already has not been all that good,'' said Carlos Kawall, chief economist for Citibank in Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial capital.
''But it won't be a totally lost year if we can get tax reform and reverse the negative tendencies we've seen in public accounts.''
The economy grew at a 5 percent rate, compared with the similar period a year earlier, the 11th consecutive quarterly rise, and exceeding expectations of 3.8 percent in a Bloomberg survey of 13 economists.
Yet while Mexico's two-year expansion has surprised economists and business executives, many think that these more comfortable times are over.
They say that recent rises in energy prices, along with the Government's proposal to increase taxes, will force the economy to lose steam in coming weeks.

The 3,500 Fedex pilots were holding out for nearly as good a deal, dimsissing several offers from the company as below industry standards.
The union was also seeking stronger protections against what it called grueling schedules that have pilots flying at night with little rest.
''The crew force was beginning to shake under Smith's threats,'' said Bob Clement, a union spokesman, referring to Frederick W. Smith, the founder of Federal Express, who is now chairman and chief executive of the FDX Corporation, its Memphis-based holding company.

After an extraordinary meeting Thursday evening, at which many senior pilots urged the union's leadership to settle with the company, the union agreed to declare a moratorium on all job actions for 60 days and to delay tallying a strike-authorization vote, the results of which are scheduled to be announced on Dec. 3.
The pilots will immediately begin flying overtime, something they had been refusing to do since Nov. 9.
In return, Fedex said it would resume contract talks on Monday.
''We are happy to confirm that service to customers will continue uninterrupted.''

The pilots could still strike early next year if negotiations with the company again fall apart.
But the likelihood is small because it seems clear that a majority of the pilots do not have the stomach for it.
In addition, a walkout in January -- a time when package volumes are low and many outside airplanes are available for lease -- represents far less of a threat to the company than one in December.
Indeed, the union's leadership now appears prepared to accept a contract that offers less than what their negotiators rejected on Oct. 30.
The only solace for militant supporters of the union is that it now appears that Fedex will sign a contract with its pilots, a feat in itself at the anti-union company.
''I think you will see the negotiations resolved in a short order,'' said Mr. Clement, the union spokesman.
''You might see a Ford Taurus rather than a Cadillac.
But you will have a contract.''
The office of the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, which had been tipped off by union members to possible impropriety in the Thanksgiving give away, is now looking into the sales of all turkeys bought and distributed in the district council.

''It all started with turkeys, and it's ending with turkeys,'' said Mark Rosenthal, the new president of the local representing motor vehicle operators.
In addition to his own local, Mr. DeCanio has sold turkeys to several others, including the local representing 2,800 motor vehicle operators, a local for 2,350 data processing workers, a local for 1,570 custodial workers and the local representing crossing guards and cafeteria aides, according to records and labor leaders who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

''He has not only fed the hungry and done acts of charity and kindness all over the country, indeed all over the world.
It is absolutely appalling that now the very acts that he was praised for many years are now a subject of condemnation.''

The tradition of giving turkeys to union members at Thanksgiving goes back to at least 1985, when Victor Gotbaum was the council's executive director.
In pleading guilty on Friday, Mr. DeCanio said that, acting as a middle man, he gave Bessie Jamison, the president of a local representing 1,800 Board of Education clerical workers, an improperly inflated invoice for the turkeys she bought.

Mr. DeCanio bought his turkeys from the Drohan Company in Woodside, Queens.
In 1995, according to the local's financial records, Robert Taylor, who was then president of the local representing motor vehicle operators, spent $11,000 for 250 turkeys -- $44 per turkey.
''Where'd he get the turkeys from, Peru?''
Members have also noted that sometimes union officials let their friends take more then one turkey.
Edward Blassingame, an urban park ranger, said: ''They used to bring a truck over, and you'd see some people leaving with two, three, four turkeys, while they'd be telling other people, 'Sorry, we've run out of turkeys.'
Many union members also complained that their leaders played favorites in distributing turkeys.
''Some members of the executive board would take cases of turkeys home for themselves,'' Mr. Rosenthal said.

Mr. Taylor's telephone number is unlisted, and district council officials said he was unavailable for comment.
This year, to remove suspicions about the turkey giving process, Mr. Rosenthal's local gave its members $20 vouchers to buy turkeys at Pathmark.
Mr. Saunders, the trustee of the crossing guards' local, did the same thing, substituting vouchers for turkeys.
This performance represents nothing short of a U-turn in investor sentiment.
Euphoria is back for stocks, but confidence has also returned to the arena for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, fueling a recovery in those securities from a moribund state two months ago.

''We've gone through a classic market cycle in a matter of weeks instead of the months or even years that it used to take,'' said John L. Manley, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
Although concerns remain, such as a continuing deterioration in corporate earnings, an Asia mired in overcapacity, uncertainty about Japan's recovery plan and Latin America on the edge, Mr. Manley said investors were anticipating better conditions in the future.
Optimism has also checked into corporate board rooms, as evidenced by yesterday's spate of merger announcements.
Nine deals were announced or reported to be under negotiation yesterday for a total of $40.4 billion, reflecting a belief among many chief executives that a recession is unlikely next year.
[Page C1.]
That most of the deals were done using stock as the acquisition currency indicates how crucial the recent rally has been to deal makers.
Because consumer confidence is inextricably linked to the stock market's performance, the recent run-up in stocks should bolster consumer confidence figures, which will be released today.
These numbers had been falling in recent months along with stocks.
But while investors who own mutual funds that mimic the stock indexes are enjoying big gains, many others are probably feeling left behind.
That is because the surge in the market indexes is, once again, not showing up across the board, with many stocks still well off their peaks.

Indeed, the broad market is only beginning to claw its way back.
According to Salomon Smith Barney, at the starting point of this market surge, on Oct. 8, the average Nasdaq stock was down 54.1 percent and the average S.& P. 500 stock had declined 32.1 percent from their 52-week highs.
Similarly, while the revival of mergers and acquisitions is an indicator of optimism, the activity is still far below the levels reached earlier this year.
Yesterday's $40.4 billion in deals brings the pace this month to $70 billion.
That is up from the low of $51 billion in September, according to the Securities Data Corporation, but nowhere near the spring's levels of $210 billion a month.

Initial public offerings are showing life, too.
But a couple of spectacular one-day gainers hide the fact that many recent offerings are hurting.
So far in 1998, the average initial offering has inched up only one-tenth of a percent.
But separating technology offerings from nontechnology ones exposes a chasm in performance.
According to Securities Data, the average technology offering is up 15.2 percent this year, while the average nontechnology offering is down 8 percent.
As for the volume of deals, investment bankers have raised $9.4 billion in 29 initial offerings since Sept. 1, but three deals -- Conoco, Fox Entertainment and Swisscom -- account for 80 percent of the money raised.
Analysts pointed to several factors driving stock prices.
The single biggest driver is the rapid rise in the nation's money supply.
The figure for M-2 -- the broadest money supply measure that includes checking accounts, savings accounts, money market funds and other assets -- has grown at an annual rate of 9.3 percent in the last three months.
This is the biggest rise since 1987, and much of this money is flooding into stocks.
Another factor propelling equity prices is the large number of investors who are buying back shares to cut their losses on open short positions, or bets that stock prices would decline.
A short position is created when an investor borrows shares and then sells them.
If the share price falls, the investor can profit by buying shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed ones.
Conversely, if the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces a loss.
Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions, are those shares that have been borrowed and sold but not yet covered by repurchase.
Those investors who thought stocks were headed for a fall are now scrambling to limit their losses caused by the big move up.
That is the largest decline in more than a year and indicates that pessimistic traders are having second thoughts.
It has not hurt, of course, that the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times since late September.
The 30-year Treasury bond is yielding 5.25 percent, an unappealing rate for investors accustomed to double-digit gains.
It seems that more and more investors see nowhere else to put their money except in stocks or higher-yielding junk bonds.
Some investors also say there are more interest rate cuts to come, although the Fed has signaled it would prefer to hold off on further reductions.
Jason Trennert, vice president at International Strategy and Investment in New York, says that continuing weakness in gold and commodity prices is predicting further easing by the Fed.
''Most likely monetary policy around the world is too tight,'' he said.
''We're of the opinion that the Fed left the door open for more easings.''
Lower interest rates are a tonic for both stocks and bonds.
As a result, few strategists are willing to say this market's run is over.
''Fear and greed are both contagious,'' Mr. Manley said.
In a good year, a tree will produce 100 pounds of pecans, about 1,000 pounds an acre.
Farmers still speak wistfully of 1978, when the state produced 135 million pounds.
This year's shortfall is forcing prices to $7 or more a pound for halves, up about a $1 from last year's prices.

The harvest, which began about a month ago, is now going full bore and is likely to continue well into December.
You start to see roadside stands that advertise ''new crop pecans'' along the flat highways that radiate south from Macon.
In Georgia, freshness is so important that in mid-October, as the harvest was just getting under way, there were no pecans for sale at a Harry's Farmers Market in Marietta, one of a chain of huge food stores in the Atlanta area.
''We're waiting for this year's crop,'' a clerk said.
A fresh pecan is a revelation, a far different thing from the brown, often wizened nut that you find in bags on supermarket shelves.
At its best, no more than a month off the tree, a pecan is golden, plump and tender, with a mellow, buttery flavor and hardly any of the bitter tannins found in the walnut, a distant relative.
The farmers always hope for an early harvest, starting in mid-October and finishing fast.
Later in the season, when the tree's slender, gray-green leaves begin to drop, they slow the complex sorting and grading process.
And in an off year especially, it becomes a burdensome expense.
''One good day of harvest in October is worth a week in December,'' Mr. Pearson said.
But Mr. Pearson, a gray-haired man who manages to avoid the farmer's weather-beaten look, is into pecan production for keeps, as temperamental as it may be.
Constantly fishing the smooth-shelled oval nuts from his pocket, cracking them in his palms and absent-mindedly munching them, he explained that his great-grandfather came to the region from a town near the Alabama border more than 100 years ago for logging and farming.
Pecans are native to the lower Mississippi Valley but not to Georgia.
They are a relative of the hickory, and their name comes from a Cree word meaning ''bone shell'' or ''hard shell.''
Their botanical name, Carya illinoinensis, or Illinois hickory, may be a misnomer, since you won't find many pecans growing there.
Texas follows Georgia in production, with an average of 60 million pounds a year.
Pecan trees still flourish at Mount Vernon.
The ideal pecan tree -- one that is easy to grow, has a straight trunk that is not vulnerable to storms and matures early with high yields of large, high-quality paper-shell nuts -- has not been developed.
Today, there are more than 500 growers in Georgia but no single major brand to promote them, the way Diamond Walnut Growers has established a market for California walnuts.

Mr. Pearson's grandfather John Winlock Pearson, who was the oldest of six boys and six girls -- a number that gives Big 6 Farms its name -- grew mostly peaches.
Fort Valley is in Peach County.
Mr. Pearson's father, Lawton Pearson, began planting pecans on a large scale after World War II, finding that the two crops complemented each other: they require the same soil and can be harvested at different times.
Mr. Pearson now runs the farm's 1,100 acres of pecans and 1,200 acres of peaches with his brother-in-law Bill McGehee.
''I wish it could be all pecans,'' Mr. Pearson said.
''They're less labor-intensive, and they don't have a lot of competition, the way the peaches do from California.
I think there's a real future for them.''
By future, Mr. Pearson is looking beyond Thanksgiving's pies, or even the few weeks following the holiday when bags of the nuts are added to cookies and gift baskets.
And perhaps he is also looking beyond our shores.
Unlike other indigenous American foods -- corn, beans and potatoes, for example -- pecans have never been embraced by Europeans and are still relatively unknown in Europe or other parts of the world.
Hardly any of the American crop is exported.
Only recently have pecans been grown outside the United States, notably in Australia and South Africa.
But if there is to be future growth in the pecan market, there must also be an appreciation for pecans that goes beyond the pie and a few other confections.
Pecan pie is on every Georgian menu, of course.
It's usually made with nut pieces, not halves, and often has a gooey, pale filling, because many Georgian cooks use granulated sugar and light corn syrup.
Elizabeth Terry, an owner of Elizabeth on 37th, a restaurant in Savannah, said that the more delicate flavor is needed to make the pecan taste stand out.
(She also toasts her pecans for pies.)
It's the same at the venerable New Perry Hotel in Perry.
But Mr. Pearson's wife, Mary, who bakes the pies that the Pearsons sell in their cafe and store, Pearson Farms, also in Perry, uses light brown sugar for a little more intensity.
When it comes to pecan pie in Georgia, everyone is an expert.
But you have to be in Georgia to understand that pecans are also there for breakfast, lunch and dinner year-round, in pancakes, muffins, salads, chicken dishes, fish breading, casserole toppings and desserts.
And also for nibbling plain, an easy habit to acquire when the nuts are so good and so fresh.
And freshness is at the heart of the matter.
They know how to handle pecans in Georgia.
When the season is over, Georgians maintain the quality of the nuts by keeping them refrigerated, which will preserve them for a month or so, or better still, by freezing them, which holds them in top condition for six months or longer.

''If people came down into a grove and tasted a fresh pecan, they might never buy one from a store,'' said Buddy Leger, who grows pecans at L & M Enterprises in nearby Cordele, and who is also the chairman of the state's Pecan Commission.
''We can't get supermarkets to put them in the cooler with the produce.''
Because pecans have such a high fat content -- more than 70 percent, compared with 64 percent for walnuts -- they easily turn rancid and acrid.
But freshness is only the first thing to understand about Georgia's pecans.
Of the 100 or so varieties, about 30 have been developed for commercial production, and several of them are important in Georgia.
Stuarts -- medium to large flattened ovals -- are the most likely to be on store shelves outside the state.
The Schley -- pronounced SLY and more spade-shaped than the Stuart -- has the thinnest shell, making it the easiest to crack; it is often sold in the shell.
The largest of the lot is the Desirable, which is often called ''mammoth'' in mail-order catalogues.
It is fat and meaty but slightly rumpled-looking.
And who would not be intrigued by medium-size ones called Cape Fear?
But local connoisseurs tend to prefer the plump but small, rounded Elliotts.
''Why does anyone need a nut larger than the Elliott, especially when it tastes so good?''
It isn't hard to be won over; they are deliciously sweet and beautiful, in flawless halves.

At Ellis Brothers Pecans, a grower and sheller in Vienna (pronounced vye-AN-nuh), the owners love the Elliott because the neat, perfect halves are easily popped from the shells.
''It doesn't make pieces, and in our business, we want 85 percent of the nuts in halves,'' said Elliot Ellis, who is an owner of the company, which was founded by his father in 1944, and whose first name is a coincidence.
Once the nuts have been harvested and separated from debris like leaves, twigs and stones, they are polished mechanically to remove the natural black streaks that sometimes mark the shells, a process that is strictly cosmetic.
Then the shells are washed in a chlorine solution to sanitize them before they are fed into a bank of crackers, where each nut is grabbed in a little vise and hit by a plunger to break the shell, at the rate of one nut a second.
At Ellis Brothers, which is a relatively small company, 10,000 pounds are processed a day during harvest time.
The nuts pass through a series of contraptions with galvanized metal arms and chutes covered in pecan dust.
In the chutes, extraneous bits of shell are removed, as the nuts are sorted and graded before reaching conveyors, where women do a final inspection and sort the pecans by hand.
Then the nuts are bagged.
Some go directly into the country store in the front of the plant, where they sail off the shelves.
''This year we know we can sell everything we shell,'' Mr. Ellis said.
So, it may pay to stock up on shelled pecans.
Now.
Just remember to put them in the freezer.

His circumspect view may well have sharpened Mr. Moss's performance this year.
It has achieved a return of 14.3 percent through Nov. 20 -- notably north of the 8.4 percent for its better-known, value-oriented sister fund, Harbor International, and the 8.3 percent average for its peer group of foreign stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
Over three years, Harbor International Growth has tallied an average annual return of 18.5 percent versus 16.2 for the sister fund and 9.2 percent for the peer group.

In 1997, as much as 14 percent of the portfolio was in Hong Kong real estate and bank stocks.
Asian companies outside Hong Kong don't tempt him.
''With the debacle of currency devaluations and falls in the stock market, the companies we used to follow in places like the Philippines and Thailand, specifically, are no longer viable, in that their market capitalizations are too low for us to become interested,'' he said.
As for Japan, companies like Sony, Matsushita Electric Industrial and Hitachi ''have unfortunately become cyclical,'' in part because of slowing consumer spending there, he said.
''They are no longer secular growth companies on which one can rely'' for consistent earnings growth, he added.
So how is Mr. Moss playing Europe?
While he doesn't see a recession there, he expects economic growth to slow to 1.5 to 2 percent annually over the next 12 to 18 months, from his estimate of 2.3 to 3 percent for this year.
As a result, earnings in cyclical sectors like chemicals, steel and auto-making are likely to slump, while well-managed noncyclicals -- the kind he prefers, in any case -- should do much better.
That points to drug, telephone and bank companies as outperformers.
He expects European economic growth ''to pick up from the middle of 2000 going forward.''

For companies that can expand, he said, the elimination of economic borders in the European Union offers huge opportunities.
''From the individual company point of view, this will become the United States of Europe,'' he said.
''So you will see the growth of new, pan-European companies.''
HE predicted that many of those companies would be based in southern Europe, where, after decades of high inflation and high interest rates, governments have adopted many of the disciplined economic policies of their northern neighbors.
About one-third of his fund's assets are invested in southern Europe, mainly in banks and telephone companies, which often meet his growth criteria.
The fund's biggest holding, at 6.4 percent of assets, is Unicredito Italiano, a Milan-based bank previously named Credito Italiano.
Its chief executive, Alessandro Profumo, is expanding the company, trimming costs and making it ''very shareholder-friendly,'' Mr. Moss said.
He started buying the stock last year at 3,400 lire.
Another big position in southern Europe, at about 5 percent of the fund's assets, is Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish telephone company, which has about 85 percent of the conventional, fixed-line business in Spain and 71 percent of the cellular market.
Telefonica also has major stakes in phone companies in Latin America, where stock prices tumbled recently.
He predicts earnings growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next four to five years and said share prices would tend to rise at the same rate.

One of International Growth's newest holdings is Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical company, which Mr. Moss began buying at about 780 francs a share in late September.
Sanofi has two new cardiovascular drugs -- Plavix, a blood thinner, and Avapro, which treats high blood pressure -- that it is marketing worldwide with Bristol-Myers Squibb.
''The sales have literally exploded,'' Mr. Moss said.
He forecasts earnings growth of up to 25 percent annually for the next five years.
Computer animation is pushing into new territory on the wings of an unlikely fleet of cartoon airplanes -- characters in a series for preschoolers that began Nov. 2 on the Learning Channel on cable television.
Animators who create two-dimensional characters like those in the shows ''South Park'' and ''Rugrats'' routinely use computer graphics to replicate the hundreds of frames needed to make a character move.
But the creators of the new show, ''Jay Jay the Jet Plane,'' are using a method called real-time performance animation in which the facial expressions of as many as seven actors are detected by sensors and fed into computers, giving expressive vitality to animated characters.
The so-called digital motion-capture technique has never been used for an entire 24-minute show, according to Bruce D. Johnson, a former Hanna-Barbera executive who started Porchlight Entertainment in Los Angeles to create children's programming.
''Jay Jay'' is a joint venture of Porchlight, Chris Walker's Modern Cartoons and the character's creator, David Michel, a Dallas executive who hopes to convert the airplane stories he made up for his son into a licensing franchise.
Digital motion-capture technology has existed for a decade, but its use has been limited to a single virtual character for video or CD-ROM games and for effects in feature films, such as the figures who dangled from ropes in ''Titanic.''
Animated films like ''Antz'' from Dreamworks SKG get their three-dimensional quality through the costly, time-consuming process of adding realistic lighting and backgrounds by computer.
Motion-capture makes animation more affordable by speeding production and lowering costs; it also improves production values by giving characters the humanistic qualities animators strive for, said Joan Collins Carey, a visual-effects producer who is assembling a documentary on computer animation.

''The direction Chris is going is leading the rest of the industry,'' she said.
''This is very good for studios that want to kick out content.''
To orchestrate all the ''Jay Jay'' elements -- seven character performers, two walk-on live-action characters, miniature sets and seven model airplanes -- meant spending $1 million during the last year converting a missile plant in Oxnard, Calif., into a studio.
Proprietary software that synchronizes 35 Compaq Alpha NT computers does the job.

Like a situation comedy, ''Jay Jay'' uses several cameras that shift the audience's point of view.
''We're shooting 11 minutes of production animation a day,'' said Douglas Rask, the show's producer.
''It's a volume unheard of in animation.''
Modern Cartoons falls short of the Holy Grail of animation: the simulation of human motion naturally.
''Jay Jay'' characters rely only on actors' faces; their bodies are airplanes.
But Mr. Walker thinks the show has achieved a breakthrough.
''We've industrialized cartoon production with motion-capture,'' he said.
''I've been working toward this for 12 years.''
The cable network, owned by Discovery Communications and distributed to 70 million homes, has licensed 26 episodes for each of three years.
The partners hope to turn a profit by selling foreign broadcast rights and merchandising.
It's a path well trod by characters like Barney and Teletubbies, and ''Jay Jay'' has an advantage they lacked.
In the last four years, Mr. Michel has sold 250,000 ''Jay Jay'' videos that featured some of the same production techniques, mostly using direct-response advertising on two children's cable channels, Viacom's Nickelodeon and Time Warner's Cartoon Network.
The Learning Channel ''is not a destination point for preschoolers,'' Mr. Michel said.
''They've made a big commitment in giving us a time slot.''
About 1,500 people work in the exchange's open-outcry pits, but more than 200 of them have been retrained to operate trading screens in the offices of the exchange's 212 members.
Some traders said the real test would come with busier trading.
The challenge to the London exchange is driven by the planned introduction of Europe's single currency, the euro, on Jan. 1, which has galvanized European financial markets into cross-border deals to strengthen their position and compete for business in the 11-nation euro zone.
In a further acknowledgment that the insurgents are gaining ground, the London exchange also announced today that from next month it would use two competing euro interest rates as a reference for euro futures contracts -- the Euribor, which is calculated by 57 mostly European banks, and the euro Libor, which is based on daily quotes from 16 international banks.
Traders said it was still unclear which rate would be most commonly used and how much they would differ from each other.

By contrast, moves in other market measures were much more modest.
Gains in the Dow would have been bigger but for a slide in the price of Exxon, which fell 3 3/8, to 71 5/8.
Analysts who say the market has little room to advance further acknowledge that bonds are providing a positive framework for stocks.
''Bond yields are lower, and that is positive, but I still think the market is exhausted,'' said Douglas Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan & Company.
''All the good news is at hand: the buyers are back, and it seems foreign investors, which pretty clearly have a big-cap, technology bias to their buying, are also back in the market.''
Given the drop in bond yields, Mr. Cliggott says that according to his valuation model, stocks are now about 2.5 percent overvalued, a level he concedes is ''not a big deal.''

Analysts attributed much of the decline to profit taking following big gains in recent weeks, and to concerns that major central banks are unlikely to cut interest rates further before the end of the year.
Cisco Systems, which is building much of the Internet's infrastructure, gained 4 3/8, to 79 3/4.
-------------------- Bonds Gain Again
(By Bloomberg News) -- United States bonds rose for a fifth session yesterday, driving 30-year yields to six-week lows, amid optimism that falling oil prices will curb inflation.
A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

Bonds got support earlier, rallying almost a point, as a second day of declines in global stock markets spurred demand for the safety of Treasuries.
But, with stocks up, ''that's taken some steam out of the bond market,'' said John Burgess, who oversees about $90 billion at Bankers Trust.
The drop in oil prices served as a reminder that the Federal Reserve may still cut interest rates for a fourth time, because falling oil prices will hurt economies, especially in Latin America, that depend on oil exports, said Richard Gilhooly, a senior bond strategist at Paribas.
The bank argues that it would have been less harmful to let the currencies fall but keep interest rates low in an effort to revive the economies as quickly as possible.
But that choice would have created other difficulties, worsening inflation and perhaps discouraging foreign investors from returning to those markets for years, other economists argue.

The primary responsibility of the World Bank is tending to the poor, with development programs to help them fight poverty and disease.
The fund focuses chiefly on economic and monetary policy.
The report predicts that most of the countries involved will probably begin climbing out of their recessions next year, with growth continuing in 2000.
But it warns that a rebound is not certain and that ''there is still a substantial risk that the world economy will plunge into recession in 1999,'' particularly if Japan is unable to end its recession.
The report reflects a broader debate among economists and policymakers about whether decisions by the fund and the United States Treasury deepened the crisis and whether the movement in recent years to liberalize financial markets around the world should be dramatically slowed.
It argues that some system should be developed to limit the rush of short-term investments into developing countries that do not have the systems to monitor spending.
The surge is followed by a precipitous flow out.
Few countries, no matter how strong their financial institutions, could have withstood such a turnaround.
Neither the I.M.F.
There are parts that the agencies agree with.
Officials of the fund and the Treasury have often faulted the huge volume of private investment into developing countries, as well as investors' refusal to heed the risks associated with investing in countries with few regulatory safeguards, for creating the conditions that led to the bust.
And the officials say no one foresaw the extent of the crisis.
But they continue to defend their initial strategy of urging Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to raise interest rates, a classic economic solution intended to reassure investors and stabilize currencies.
In Thailand and South Korea, interest rates have declined, to about 7 percent, and the currencies have stabilized, developments that fund officials say vindicate their approach.
The bank report argues that the strategy backfired, stabilizing the currencies at the cost of plunging the countries into deep recessions, with substantial unemployment.

The higher interest rate, the study says, spread the economic pain far beyond the banks, investment funds and real estate companies that got the countries into trouble to begin with, sending thousands of small businesses in to bankruptcy.

''Some estimates are that levels of bankruptcy in Indonesia now are 75 percent,'' Mr. Stiglitz said.
''And, you know, you cannot have a country perform with 75 percent of its firms in bankruptcy.''
Although the World Bank is a major participant in that bailout, it warned today against the risk of what it termed ''rescue creep'' as aid packages grow larger and larger.
''No reasonable amount of public money can stop a justified speculative attack'' on a currency, the World Bank said.
''Larger packages worsen moral hazard problems,'' the risk that investors will expect governments to bail them out, ''and may lead to excessively tough conditions, defeating the end objectives.''
Their differing mandates have often led the World Bank and the I.M.F.
to disagreements.
One of the many proposals here Washington to reform the institutions would merge their governing boards, but that would require a marriage of two extremely different cultures.
The fund also argues that its program in Indonesia was undermined by the refusal of President Suharto's Government to stick to its economic agreements and then by the chaos that resulted in Mr. Suharto's resignation and continues on the streets.

Several months ago the first deputy managing director of the fund, Stanley Fischer, said, ''In most cases governments call us in only after they discover they are in a mess, usually because they didn't do things they needed to do long ago.''
Many of the conclusions in the report are likely to fuel the debate over what to do next.
The bank calls for a major slowdown in the movement to deregulate financial markets in developing countries, a reversal of the policy that the fund advocated as late as April 1997, three months before the troubles in Thailand touched off the crisis.
''Financial-sector liberalization,'' the report adds, ''which can significantly boost the risk of crisis, should proceed with care -- fully and in step with the capacity to design and enforce tighter regulation and supervision.''
In the last year the fund and the Treasury have begun to take the same stance, stressing the need to build regulatory institutions before opening economies to huge capital flows.
The bank praised fund programs in several countries, including their focus on reorganizing corporations and compelling countries, in return for aid, to overhaul bankruptcy systems and inject public money into weak banking systems.
for loosening the conditions on the bailouts to ease the pain on the poor.
But it noted that 17 million more Indonesians are expected to fall below that country's poverty line.
THE YEN RISES.
Some 64.1 percent of all Americans of working age now have jobs, the highest percentage on record.
And even though about 250,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs have been lost this year, American workers on average are earning 3.7 percent more than a year ago, a strong increase at a time when inflation has nearly vanished.

Despite the tightest labor market in decades -- the unemployment rate has been below 5 percent now for nearly a year and a half -- there is little evidence that rising wages are starting to push up prices.
While economic turmoil swirls outside the United States, prime-age workers -- those between the ages of 35 and 54, who are the breadwinners of millions of American families -- are enjoying the same low unemployment rate, 3 percent, as in the best of the Eisenhower years.
The strong labor market suggests that the economy, while expected to slow from the current brisk pace, has plenty of momentum to keep expanding next year.
Wall Street cheered the report, seeing hints that company profits may improve next year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 136 points, closing above 9,000.
The bond market, which often fears that a robust economy threatens to lift inflation, took the unexpectedly strong numbers largely in stride, pushing long-term interest rates up only slightly.
[Page C1.]
The report appeared to dash any lingering hopes that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates again when it meets later this month for its final monetary policy session of the year.
So far this year, the economy has been growing at a 3.7 percent annual rate and adding an average of 226,000 jobs a month.
The economy entered its 91st month of uninterrupted growth in December, suggesting that the current expansion will soon surpass the 92-month period of growth in the 1980's.
It will beat the record 1960's expansion if growth continues for another year.
Not everything is rosy by any means.
American manufacturers are struggling, and factory workers are losing jobs in large numbers.
Manufacturers shed 47,000 jobs last month after eliminating 61,000 in October.
''There's a spending-and-construction boom and a production bust,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company.
How can the total number of jobs grow so much when so many people appear to be losing theirs?
The answer lies in the capitalist process of constant job destruction and job creation that the economist Joseph Schumpeter termed ''creative destruction'' as long ago as 1942.
Even a large number of layoff announcements, expected to exceed 600,000 this year, pales in a economy that has added more than 19 million jobs this decade and currently employs about 132 million people.

In fact, numbers based on newspaper reports grossly understate the amount of job destruction.
''Big layoff stories are the tip of the iceberg,'' said Steven Davis, a labor economist at the University of Chicago's business school.
Something like one in 10 jobs disappear in a typical year, research by Mr. Davis and others shows.
That means roughly 13 million jobs vanished this year.

When unemployment is this low, workers to fill new jobs have to come from somewhere else.
''If Boeing lays off 20,000 workers, we need them,'' said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business.
Nearly one-third of small businesses surveyed last month reported having trouble filling job openings.
''These are not hamburger-flipping jobs,'' Mr. Dunkelberg added.
Evidence that he is right comes from the rapid rise in average wages -- especially in real, inflation-adjusted terms -- for the last few years.
Of course, there is plenty of pain in manufacturing, which employs about 15 percent of the work force.
American industry is being battered by a nasty combination of slowing capital investment at home, collapsing export markets abroad and surging imports, which depress prices and profits as well as cut into sales.
A sharp 1.6 percent drop in factory orders in October portends further pain ahead.
Since last March, manufacturing payrolls have fallen by nearly a quarter of a million jobs as companies cut production and struggle to rein in costs.
Not surprisingly, the cutbacks have been biggest in those industries that are most affected by foreign trade, including metal, transportation equipment, capital goods, clothing, textiles and electronics.
While manufacturing is in a slump, the rest of the economy is on a tear.
Retailers, gearing up for holiday sales, did lots of hiring, adding 65,000 more workers than they normally do at this time of year.
Over the year, employment in this industry has risen by 457,000.
Over the last 12 months, employment in construction has risen 310,000.
''The housing market is going to set its third consecutive record this year,'' said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae, the biggest buyer of home mortgages.
As it has month after month, the sprawling service sector continued to power the job machine, adding 50,000 new jobs in November, the largest increase since May.
Employment in business services rose by 55,000, including 30,000 management and engineering consultants.
With labor markets this tight and job growth this robust, wages are rising briskly, but the pace of increase slowed slightly last month.

Still, with workers producing more per hour, those wage gains are being largely offset by greater efficiency, easing the strains on companies that find it difficult, if not impossible, to raise prices.
So, with that negligible inflation, pay increases are being translated into some of the best gains in real purchasing power in decades.
It was in New York, however, that I encountered a quintessentially French delicacy and one that encapsulates the danger of dining with the rich.
A rather grand dinner had for its centerpiece an enormous platter of frogs' legs, an entree that the humbler folk among my acquaintance wouldn't dream of serving.
The others dutifully bent their heads to their plates.
Some of the guests may have been delighted.
The remainder, I suspect, wanted only to be out of there and into McDonald's.

The menus in Japanese restaurants are often mysterious, though not so mysterious as to stop me from ordering sushi deluxe at every opportunity.

Other lawmakers were still smarting over Mr. Hawke's aggressive behind-the-scenes lobbying that helped scuttle legislation to overhaul the nation's banking laws earlier this year.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
To the senators involved, the delay was not over Mr. Hawke's credentials, but his policies.
''Jerry Hawke knows his banking law,'' Mr. Sarbanes said, using Mr. Hawke's nickname.
''But the question is to what purpose will he put that knowledge to work?''
So the 65-year-old Mr. Hawke, who, many say, has wanted all his life to be the Comptroller, was put into the awkward -- and embarrassing -- position of being in a bureaucratic no-man's land.
Even his detractors acknowledge that on the basis of his brains and experience alone, Mr. Hawke deserves the job of overseeing more than 2,700 national banks with $2.5 trillion in assets.
In doing so, his views made him many friends -- and some influential foes.
''But he is philosophically at odds with many members of Congress, and they have gotten royally mad at him.''
Mr. Hawke, who has been Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance since 1995, would not comment yesterday.
Still, it is apparent that he stepped on some Congressional trip wires.
For his part, Mr. Sarbanes said, ''The Administration has exercised its option for a recess appointment,'' and added that he would continue working with Mr. Hawke and the Treasury Department to push his point of view.
Mr. Sarbanes has been particularly upset at the Treasury's slow response and Mr. Hawke's lackluster answers to his concerns about a new Federal program to transfer electronically all Government checks to their recipients.
Mr. Hawke ''was not fully forthcoming in his responses'' on this issue, the Senator said.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, was troubled by Mr. Hawke's vigorous defense of the Comptroller's hand in overseeing the insurance industry, at the expense of state regulators.

And many Democrats said Mr. Hawke did not embrace strongly enough one of their favorite pieces of banking legislation, the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to provide services to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
Indeed, the Democrats said Mr. Hawke leaned over backward to placate Republicans who want the act abolished -- including writing a apology to Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who is one of its staunchest critics.

''No one has it in for Hawke,'' Mr. Sarbanes said.
''There is no personal antagonism towards him.
But these are very important issues and there wasn't time to get them worked out before the end of session.
If we can get these items resolved that would place his nomination in a different light.''
With regulators and Congress often reluctant to deregulate banking, aggressive financial institutions relied on lawyers like Mr. Hawke to outfox the law.
His most famous case was a 1986 Supreme Court 8-to-0 decision that created ''nonbank banks,'' or bank-like commercial companies that provide financial services, further blurring the line between banks and other financial institutions.
He followed up his courtroom victories by helping to put together complex bank purchases in Florida, Pennsylvania, Virginia and New England.
''Jerry has a free-market and pro-competitive point of view,'' said William M. Isaac, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and a banking partner at Arnold & Porter.
''He also believes that regulators have to make sure banks are behaving in a safe and sound fashion.''
Mr. Hawke has repeatedly favored sweeping away the Depression-era laws that separate banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies.

Instead of supporting deregulation, he ended up opposing the bill when it created a corporate banking structure for new financial services activities that would have weakened the oversight authority of the Treasury Department and strengthen that of the Federal Reserve, which regulates bank holding companies.
Mr. Hawke became a strong backroom player on behalf of the Treasury Department in the resulting turf battle with the Federal Reserve.
The question was whether new financial activities would be done in subsidiaries of banks and then regulated by the Comptroller, or in affiliates of bank holding companies and thus regulated by the Federal Reserve.
Moreover, lobbyists describe a mud fight led by Mr. Hawke who, they say, telephoned them after the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund, to rail against the Fed, which helped orchestrate a rescue of the fund by banks and brokerage firms.
It got down to Treasury saying one thing and the Fed saying another.
And when it comes to who carries the most weight in Congress, it is Alan Greenspan, even though Jerry is a forceful advocate in making his case.''
Just how tough Mr. Hawke will be as Comptroller is unclear.
Banks are now allowed to have operating subsidiaries with broad powers, but their reach remains undefined.
It is up to the banks to propose what these new powers will be, whether they are underwriting revenue bonds, engaging in real estate development or starting leasing businesses.
They must then apply to the Comptroller to see whether he will allow them.
In many ways, Mr. Hawke's misfortune is an object lesson in the vicissitudes of Washington.
''Jerry recognizes what the competitive demands of the marketplace have meant for banking, which is that it hasn't been very favorable,'' said H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell.
''Therefore, I think he will try to innovate and expand bank powers.
But in Washington, you can only go so far before you blow yourself up with Congress and the Adminstration.
He will have to have a pretty good sense of where that is.''
It is set to pay a lower interest rate than South Korea, Thailand or other neighbors would if they tried to raise money now.

China's move, raising money that a country with $144 billion in foreign reserves really does not need, was a sign that investors still hungered to invest there, despite continuing risks elsewhere in Asia.
''At this moment, if China can indicate that our economy has the resilience to withstand external shocks we can also help boost confidence with the region,'' Deputy Finance Minister Jin Liqun said in a telephone interview today from the New York headquarters of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the lead underwriter of the offering along with Credit Suisse First Boston.
China is an exception.
It has fixed the exchange rate of its yuan against the dollar, and Mr. Jin repeatedly said today that ''we certainly are committed to maintaining the value of our currency,'' though did not specify for how long.
The solidity of the implicit guarantee is important to investors, who saw Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia end similar commitments last year.

By contrast, in a typical week of the O. J. Simpson trial, almost five million people were watching CNN's coverage.

Re: ''Inside the Head of the Fed: Alan Greenspan's Journey to the New World Economy'' (Nov. 15):
Mr. Greenspan may contend that central bankers cannot do much to bring an overvalued stock market back into line -- that there is no orderly way to deflate an asset bubble.
But the very thing the Fed does, smoothing short-term interest rates by setting the Federal funds rate target, does much to create asset bubbles in the market.
It greatly reduces the risk for investors who borrow short term to make leveraged bets on stocks and bonds.
If short-term rates fully and immediately responded to inflationary and deflationary events, as these rates should, investors would be much less willing to take the leveraged bets that inflate asset bubbles.
Key to greater financial and economic stability is getting the Fed out of the interest-rate signaling business.
The markets can do a much better job of setting short-term rates.

Re ''Clinton Meets 48 in Congress on Future of Social Security'' (news article, Dec. 10):
In discussing ways of saving Social Security, we should recognize that the current budget is balanced in part because it includes as revenue Social Security taxes collected in excess of payments to recipients, that the Federal debt is not eliminated by a current balanced budget, and that the reserve to make future payments to recipients is the United States Treasury's obligation.
At some point in the 21st century, current Social Security taxes and the reserve will be insufficient to pay eligible recipients.
Prior to that time, the Treasury could increase the interest it is obliged to pay on the Social Security tax deposits.
The rate of interest could then be adjusted from time to time to maintain the viability of the system.
This flexible interest rate need not be the only answer.
But it could be a part of the answer.
JACK H. HAMILTON
Lakeville, Conn., Dec. 10, 1998
The suggestion that one fund's misstep could harbor such dire consequences has Congress reconsidering how to oversee the derivatives market.
''But now we see that industry risk management controls were lacking.''
Congress has asked a Presidential working group -- with representatives from the Federal Reserve Board, the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -- to deliver a study in the coming year on the derivatives market and another on the public policy implications of the near collapse of Long-Term Capital.
Members of the working group will give a progress report to the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.
Former Fed officials and regulators will also testify before the committee, one of several looking into the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital.
Though Congressmen and regulators have not yet lined up behind specific proposals, the debate over additional regulation is spreading beyond just hedge funds and focusing on three broad areas:
*New disclosure requirements for hedge funds, which are largely unregulated, and derivatives dealers.
These groups might have to reveal their closely guarded trading positions and their risk levels frequently to regulators.
The idea has support from much of the financial industry, which says it would at least provide a window on the amount of hedging and the amount of speculating in the market.
*Some limit on how much commercial and investment banks can lend to hedge funds like Long-Term Capital or new disclosure on that lending.
For example, securities regulators might decide to monitor hedge funds weekly or monthly, rather than rely on the quarterly filings now made to the futures commission.
*The creation of a clearinghouse, much like a stock exchange, for the trading of derivatives that do not now have an exchange.
A clearinghouse could hold both parties accountable and step in to complete transactions if one party was unable to cover its losses, reducing the chance that a big default would touch off a series of defaults.
For the most part, brokerage firms now patrol their own risks, and bank regulators tend to focus on overall risk management practices, though they may look at industry sectors or even specific loans if they have a special concern.
Hedge funds, which are investment pools open only to wealthy investors, are largely unregulated.
Attempts at additional oversight will face stiff opposition from financial industry officials, who consider more regulation costly and cumbersome -- possibly stifling the smooth functioning of the derivatives markets.
Derivatives, so called because their value is derived from an underlying asset like a stock or a bond, allow companies and individuals to manage many types of risk, such as a sudden fluctuation in a currency or an interest rate, throughout the global marketplace.
Even Government regulators are torn over how and whether to tighten rules on derivatives.
In Washington, officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are in a pitched battle with the Treasury, the Fed and the S.E.C.
over which agency has jurisdiction and whether any further regulation is needed.

The derivatives market has faced down oversight before.
In late 1994, Orange County, Calif., made headlines by declaring bankruptcy after suffering more than $1.6 billion in derivatives-related losses.
Time and again, after studies and consideration, regulators backed down from wholesale regulation for fear of impeding the market's growth.
Instead, they have made incremental changes in the way banks and brokerage firms -- the major dealers in the derivatives market -- handle transactions and support industry efforts at self-regulation.
Regulators in other countries are wrestling with the problem as well.
Three months later, UBS said it would take a $700 million loss on its business with Long-Term Capital.
Since then, Dresdner Bank of Germany and Credit Suisse First Boston have also taken big hits because of Long-Term Capital.
These missteps from some of the world's most prestigious financial institutions point to another concern: the giant derivatives market rests on about a dozen global financial institutions, which account for more than half of all derivatives business, according to Swaps Monitor, an industry publication.
That concentration troubles some financial experts.
''You have huge risks building up on the shoulders of these few huge financial institutions that dominate this market,'' said Henry T. C. Hu, a derivatives expert and professor at the University of Texas Law School.
''That's a Herculean task and one that I worry about a little more now that Long-Term Capital almost collapsed.''
Though Long-Term Capital is considered unusual in the size of its bets, the extensive amount it borrowed and the number of markets it entered, there is nothing to prevent other investors from getting into similar predicaments.
A report by the International Monetary Fund suggests more problems are lurking.
In its annual survey of international capital markets, released this fall, the I.M.F.
referred to ''ticking time bombs'' buried in losing derivative trades by financial institutions in emerging markets like Asia -- time bombs that could shake government officials out of their regulatory slumber.

Derivatives contracts have exploded in the last 10 years as a way for corporations, local governments and others looking to manage risks in the global marketplace.

An American company doing business in Japan, for example, might buy an option on the Japanese yen to protect itself against a decline in the currency that could hurt its profits, posted in American dollars.
Many derivatives are standardized contracts, like this foreign currency future.
These contracts, called ''plain vanilla'' derivatives, trade on a financial exchange that is regulated.
But many other derivatives contracts are tailored for specific parties, like an interest rate swap, in which one party agrees to exchange a fixed interest rate for a floating rate with a second party for a specified period.
Such private business contracts are traded over the counter and remain off banks' balance sheets.
It is this second type of derivative that is the most vexing for regulators since trading is conducted behind closed doors and largely unregulated.
Derivatives of both types have grown, though they are measured in different ways, making direct comparisons difficult.
For the contracts not traded on an exchange, the prime measure is notional value, or the amount of the underlying asset on which they are based.
About $37 trillion in such contracts are now out, up from $865 billion in 1987, according to the International Swap and Derivatives Association.

As this market has grown, so has concern about whether banks, brokerage firms and derivatives dealers could be brought down by a market mishap, a big bet turned sour or a rogue trader at another institution.
and the C.F.T.C., take derivatives into account when setting aside capital, and follow certain guidelines when dealing with people who are not finance professionals.
For Regulation
More Information Helps Everyone
A drumbeat for greater disclosure is now being sounded by prominent Wall Street figures and hedge fund managers such as George Soros; Julian H. Robertson Jr. of Tiger Management; Citigroup's chairman, Sanford I. Weill, and the Goldman, Sachs co-chairman, Jon Corzine.
Regulators and the financial markets could, the thinking goes, operate much better with more information.
Bank regulators already have access to information about derivatives risk; in fact, they often set up shop inside big banks.
Brokerage firms voluntarily provide quarterly reports on the risks associated with derivatives.
The question remains, though, whether regulators receive information on a timely basis and whether they need information on hedge funds, which merely provide financial statements once a year to the futures commission.
Brooksley E. Born, the chairwoman of the commission, says that secrecy in the derivatives market is worrisome.
''There has been a great deal of concern internationally about the lack of transparency,'' she said in an interview.
''I share that concern.''

Creating a more open market, however, is fraught with difficulty.
The value of derivatives contracts changes rapidly, making information out of date as soon as it is gathered.
And what exactly would derivatives dealers and hedge funds disclose, since others could use that information for market gains, and whom would they disclose it to?
Regulators?
Investors?
Creditors?
Another possibility is to restrict how much regulated financial institutions can lend or require hedge funds to put up more collateral, in effect putting a brake on easy lending, which some industry officials argue is the crux of the matter.
''This is all about leverage.''
Long-Term Capital had borrowed assets equal to 25 times its capital at the end of last year, making it look more like a securities firm than the typical hedge fund.
But Representative James Leach, Republican of Iowa, and others suggest that new rules may be needed to protect against a national banking crisis since hedge funds are often supported by federally insured banks.
''It would be imprudent and anti-intellectual not to seriously review the derivatives and hedge fund industries,'' Mr. Leach, chairman of the House Banking Committee, said in an interview.
Critics of such proposals say that Government interference would only impede business.
''The problem in the derivatives market is that it's hard to figure out what something's worth,'' said Michael Segal, president of Lamborn Securities, a derivatives dealer in New York.
''You can't come up with a standard measurement to put restrictions on leverage.
This is not the place for government.''
A third proposal is the use of a private clearinghouse to settle the many derivatives trades that are not now handled on any exchange.
A clearinghouse, for a fee, would match trades and guarantee that all transactions are honored, even if one party goes bankrupt before making good on its contract.
It could also be used to impose controls on borrowing.
The clearinghouse proposal has received a great deal of attention and was recommended by the Bank for International Settlements, which coordinates global banking rules.
''It's been talked about for a long time,'' said Leslie Rahl, a principal with Capital Markets Risk Advisers, a New York consulting firm specializing in derivatives.
But the idea ''hasn't gone anywhere because of dealer resistance -- the costs and the complexities in agreeing on what something can be valued at.''

Whether a clearinghouse could stave off huge losses amid severe market turmoil is hard to determine.
''A domino effect will bring down a clearing operation, too,'' said Franklin R. Edwards, a professor of economics and finance at Columbia University.
Against Regulation
Financial Costs Of Adding Rules
Yet for all the proposals being forwarded, many regulators and financial experts worry that creating more regulatory hurdles could disrupt or stifle a vibrant and vital marketplace.
''It's very easy to call for regulation, but one needs to assess whether it's going to do any good,'' said Susan Phillips, dean of the school of business and management at George Washington University and until recently a member of the Federal Reserve Board.
''Every time someone talks about a new regulatory scheme it adds costs.''
Ms. Phillips and a host of regulators have long opposed tighter controls on derivatives that are traded over the counter.
Many of them, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, believe that the market can be more effectively regulated through banks and brokerage firms.
''Aside from safety and soundness regulation of derivatives dealers under the banking or securities laws, regulation of derivatives transactions that are privately negotiated by professionals is unnecessary,'' Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told the House Banking Committee this summer before the Long-Term Capital rescue.
For their part, the banks argue that their examiners already scrutinize derivatives activity.
''Every swap contract at every bank is regulated,'' said Mark C. Brickell, a board member of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and a managing director at J. P. Morgan.
''It comes down to, do you think the regulation of banks is sufficient?''
''If the links in the chain are strong, the chain won't break.
But the fact is, it's very difficult for regulators to see what's going on; this market is too complex, too opaque and too fast moving.''
Mr. Clark works for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, not for J. P. Morgan.
Joining the list of major oil companies that are retrenching in the face of low crude oil prices, the Chevron Corporation announced cuts yesterday in both capital spending and employment, primarily in North America.
In what has become a familiar oil company response to persistent low prices, Mr. Derr said that cuts in capital spending of 8 percent, to $5.1 billion next year, would come mostly in the company's older exploration and production, refining and marketing and chemical businesses in North America.
He said that significant spending would continue in its promising long- term prospects in Kazakhstan, West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, where the company has been able to increase its production of crude oil.
Mr. Derr added that the company would spend about $2.6 billion on exploration and production outside the United States and $1.1 billion within the United States.

The overall reductions in its work force of 34,000 would be modest, he said, because of the overseas growth.
It said it would sell 40 percent of its chemical business, cut staff and take charges of $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
There was speculation early last week that Chevron and Royal Dutch would merge, fed by rumors on the Internet.
Mr. Derr said yesterday that ''we will consider mergers or acquisitions as one possible way to improve business results, but it is not necessary for Chevron to merge with a competitor to continue to provide top returns to our shareholders.''

He added, ''We have the financial strength to deal with low oil prices, poor economic conditions in Asia and other financial challenges over the next few years.''
With crude about 40 percent lower than a year ago, the oil companies see little prospect of a recovery, although the January crude oil contract rose 26 cents, to $11.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday.
There was some hope that a meeting tomorrow among three of the world's largest producers, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, could lead to another round of cuts in crude oil production.
It had been difficult, however, to agree to further cuts since the low crude oil prices have severly reduced the producing countries' revenue.
Most are reluctant to cut further, fearing that other countries would eat into their market share by not abiding by the lower production levels.
Thus most oil companies, having gone through years of retrenchment, are preparing for a long period of low crude oil prices with another round of cost cutting.

The company's work force has fallen to the current 34,000 from 54,000 in 1991.
Still, with neither side in a rush to negotiate, it appears that Jan. 1 is not a hard deadline for an impending settlement.
Hunter even spoke of the season beginning Feb. 1, a date that would allow teams a 40- to 50-game season.

''Of course it concerns me,'' Hunter said, when asked if he was worried about not reaching an accord before Christmas.
Obviously, I'm not.
I look at David, and I figure David will be the one to decide when and if we get a deal.
When he's ready, he'll negotiate.
Obviously, his time line is not affected by the week before Christmas now that he's going to Aspen, Colo.''
That was just one of several shots Hunter lobbed Stern's way yesterday.
Indicative of how pride has filtered into the negotiations, Hunter also seems to be fed up with initiating conversations to bring the sides back to the table.
''The problem with initial contact, it gives the impression we're weakened,'' he said.
''I know on several occasions they haven't called is because it's an issue of a pride, and that goes before the fall.
Maybe this time, I need to stay where I am and see if they want to talk to me.''
Stern disputed that Hunter is always the one to make first contact.

''As we told the union's representatives, we remain willing to negotiate at any time and at any location if it will be productive.''
The most ominous stumbling blocks to a deal remain how large a percentage of revenues will be devoted to salaries, and whether there will be an absolute maximum salary for players with more than seven years' experience.
On many other issues, the sides are gaining ground.
''There will be no piecemeal negotiations,'' Hunter said.
''We're not going to sit around and concede.
We always concede to the demands of the N.B.A., and we're no longer going to engage in that.''
Hunter also addressed the issue of race in the negotiations, a subject that has been openly discussed in articles in Newsweek magazine and The New York Times this past week.

''No, I don't think race is,'' he said.
''The problem is, you've got a group of extremely successful businessmen who own teams.
Most of them are billionaires.
You've got men accustomed to seeing their dictates honored.
When they make a demand, it's customary that most people respond to it.
''On the other side of the table, you've got a group of players who are predominantly African-American in origin.
People can read into it anything they want.
But I think it's all about dollars.
It's about hard economics.
People tend to read different things.
If things don't go right or tempers flare, the first reaction is, it's got to be racial.
I think we have to put that aside and get a deal.''
Finally, Hunter also warned of the grave consequences of a lost season, including the formation of a rival league.
He spoke of ''other individuals who would step up and try to fill the void, create another league, a competing league.''

If there's a mass exodus, I think the N.B.A.
would be decimated.
It's ludicrous for us to not try and reach an accord.''

Similarly, the impeachment of President Clinton by the House of Representatives is viewed by many on Wall Street as all but certain, and only mild anxiety so far surrounds a possible Senate trial next year.
In the meantime, said Edward Collins, head of trading at Daiwa Securities America, the financial markets have other events in view, namely the release of fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports.
''It's probably sacrilegious to say it, but I don't think whoever is in the White House has as much to do with what goes on in the business world or the market as the fact that right now the Federal Reserve is being extremely friendly,'' Mr. Collins said.
By keeping interest rates low and the supply of money flowing, the Fed has most investors feeling they have little reason to worry about a quick downturn in the economy.
Since the stock market's midsummer slump, both of those benchmarks have lagged behind the Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily laden with the technology stocks that have been the hottest performers this year.
That is more than double the 12 percent rise in the Dow industrials and well ahead of the 22 percent gain in the S.& P. 500.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.01 percent, from 4.99 percent on Wednesday.
Certainly events could turn darker for the markets and the economy generally, and investors could even see the return of a bit more volatility to the market today, traders said.
Today's session marks the quarterly occurrence known as ''triple witching,'' when options, futures contracts and options on futures all expire, sometimes accompanied by more frenetic trading.
The greatest activity yesterday could be found among financial and technology stocks as investors reacted positively to Chase Manhattan Bank's announcement on Wednesday that its fourth-quarter profits would be better than expected.

Abby Joseph Cohen, the widely followed investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, told clients in a recent report that many semiconductor-related companies might be well situated to generate earnings gains.

That view helped to pull technology stocks generally higher, and as they are wont to do, investors used any hint of good news as an excuse to buy shares of Internet-related companies like Yahoo and America Online.
As investors look ahead to the beginning of the year, there are several things that are likely to weigh more heavily on their minds if they have not begun to do so already.
In the wake of the market's October reprise of its August decline, mutual funds have been a bit slower than usual to put new cash to work, financial analysts say.
In addition, there is every reason to expect that January will bring a flood of new money into those portfolios as a new cycle of payments into retirement plans begins.
Therefore, institutional investors ''are feeling the need to put money to work beforehand,'' Mr. Collins said.
But other factors could begin to temper the optimism of investors as the year progresses.
Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers, said that the new year would only bring more discussion and confusion about the possible effect of the Year 2000 problem.
''It's hard to see how Y2K isn't going to create some distortions in market and economic activity,'' Mr. Applegate said.
''For example, the preference for just-in-time inventory could turn into just-in-case, and we could see an inventory buildup,'' he said.
In addition, he said, ''there are likely to be a whole lot of little credit crunches going on, even before the Year 2000 gets here.''
And stock picking will become more important than simply buying a market index, she added.

''We believe that the S.& P. 500 is roughly at fair value based on our views for the coming year,'' she wrote.
''But several sectors appear to offer more attractive value opportunities,'' among them semiconductor-related companies and energy stocks.
Mr. Applegate, too, has indicated that gains in the market next year should be more in line with long-term trends -- and far below the returns of 25 percent or more experienced over the last four years.
That is roughly equivalent to 9,850 for the Dow industrials, she added, or about 10 percent above the gauge's current price.

Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, called impeachment ''a runaway train headed for a cliff.''
Sharply partisan like all the others in recent months, the debate lasted through the day, ending at precisely 10 P.M.
It came, too, in a coincidental conjunction that would have delighted Kafka, at the very height of the holiday season for both Christians and Jews, with festivities scheduled every night at the White House.
''I think the vast majority of Americans share my approval and pride in the job that the President's been doing for our country,'' Mrs. Clinton said on the White House lawn, with the dome of the Capitol, where the impeachment debate was under way, looming behind her.
White House aides said Mr. Clinton would address the nation after the impeachment votes.
She said that ''his usefulness would be lost in dealing with other nations.''
Democrats planned to march out of the chamber in protest after losing their censure move and to return for the impeachment vote.
The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, replied that the President would ''absolutely not'' consider resigning, and he launched a fresh attack on the Republicans on Capitol Hill, accusing Republican leaders of luring moderates into supporting impeachment by denigrating its ultimate importance.
Mr. Clinton spent the day dealing with Iraq and the international economy and in meetings with foreign leaders, including Chancellor Viktor Klima of Austria.

While conceding that the President had committed reprehensible acts and made deceitful statements to cover them up, Democratic members of the House argued that his actions did not come close to warranting impeachment, that they should be given an opportunity to vote on censure as an alternative to impeachment -- an option the majority has denied them -- and that the debate should not be taking place during military action in Iraq.
''What we are doing is equally wrong -- an exercise in the abuse of power by the majority over the minority.''
The House's only independent member, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, decried the prospect of a vote ''perhaps to paralyze our government as the Senate explores Bill Clinton's extramarital relations.''
''If it is in his interest not to tell the truth,'' the Californian said of Mr. Clinton, ''he will not tell the truth.''
Mr. Campbell's flawless legal pedigree -- son of a Federal judge, star student at the Harvard Law School, clerk to a Supreme Court justice, former professor at Stanford Law School -- lent weight to his words.
But another Republican, Constance A. Morella of Maryland, said she would vote against impeachment.
No matter what happens, she said, Mr. Clinton's legacy ''shall be indelibly stained.''

Representative Ray LaHood, who comes from the quintessentially Middle American city of Peoria, Ill., presided over the debate, in which dozens of members participated.
A low buzz hovered over the House chamber for most of the day, fed by whispered chats among members, ad hoc conferences, the rustle of turning newspaper pages and speeches practiced in stage whispers.
A few times, hissing and hooting was heard.
Democrats bemoaned the lack of civility that has marked the entire process that has brought the President and nation to the current moment of crisis.
African-Americans, who benefited hugely from all of those programs, have been among the President's staunchest backers from the start.
In 1998, it's still about Reconstruction.''
''Some of my colleagues,'' said Representative Vic Fazio of California, a Democrat who is retiring, ''obsess about Slick Willie in the same way that those on my side of aisle used to [obsess] about Tricky Dick.''
But the continuing air assault on Iraq, which is code-named ''Desert Fox,'' came up more often today than transgressions and crises from the past.
''You can't separate the President from the Commander in Chief,'' said Mr. Rangel.
''You can't salute him in the morning and impeach him in the afternoon.''
For the Republicans, Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, who spent seven years in a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp, made this retort: ''Our military fighting men want the Congress to carry on our responsibilities every day.''
A potentially volatile ingredient was injected into the political equation by the Thursday evening confession of marital infidelity by Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, the Speaker-designate.
As read out this morning in a somber voice by the House reading clerk, Paul Hays, it began ''Resolved, that William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors,'' and went on to accuse Mr. Clinton of perjury before a grand jury and in the Paula Jones lawsuit, of obstructing justice in a variety of ways, and of abusing his power by lying to and misleading Congress in his answers to 81 questions posed by the House Judiciary Committee.
Forbidden Fairways
African Americans and
the Game of Golf.
By Calvin H. Sinnette.
Illustrated.
216 pp.
Chelsea, Mich.:
Sleeping Bear Press.
$24.95.
While many African-Americans have loved golf for generations, the sport has not always returned that love.
Calvin H. Sinnette shows that in ''Forbidden Fairways,'' a straightforward and informative book that describes the exploits of many courageous, innovative and determined individuals.
The book's jacket cover depicts Bill Spiller, a legendary black golfer during the 1940's and 50's, sitting forlornly on a bench at the 1952 San Diego Open, head in his hand, dejection on his face, after being excluded from the tournament because of the Professional Golfers' Association's color bar.
Yet, as Sinnette notes, many blacks have overcome great odds to make important contributions to golf's history.
Sinnette -- giving credit to black newspapers for providing critical references, because mainstream newspapers seldom published information about minority exploits in golf -- begins with the sport's all-too-little-known African-American trailblazers.
Around the same time, Joseph Bartholomew, a noted architect, designed and built more than a half-dozen golf courses in the New Orleans area.
''Finally fed up with the prejudice that was preventing African-Americans from playing the game,'' Sinnette writes, ''Bartholomew constructed a seven-hole course for black golfers on property he owned in nearby Harahan, La.
It was separate, but -- even with his superb skills -- he could not make it equal.''
As of 1998, Sinnette could find only four black-owned golf courses in existence, the oldest being the Clearview Golf Course in East Canton, Ohio, owned by William Powell, the father of Renee Powell, who played on the Ladies' Professional Golf Association Tour for 13 years.

There is ample room for more books on African-Americans in golf.
However, ''Forbidden Fairways'' required passion and persistence, and Sinnette has done a significant service in bringing attention to achievements and struggles that are an important part of golf's history.
Attendance at the local school on Saturdays to make up for class time lost during a teachers strike has been surprisingly high, administrators say, because the children want the free lunches.

Chile has been South America's economic model for the last 20 years, with growth rates averaging more than 8 percent a year during the last decade.
The country led the way in privatizing inefficient state-owned businesses, and its privatized pension system has been adopted by Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay.
But now Chile's economic miracle is stumbling, mostly because nearly 40 percent of its export earnings come from copper.
From a price of $1.19 per pound in June 1997, the price of copper on the world market has declined to 65 cents a pound, its lowest level since 1987.
That has meant a loss of $1.5 billion in export earnings in the first 10 months of this year.
The effects could have been far worse had oil prices not also tumbled, saving Chile more than $200 million over the same period.
Nevertheless, the signs of a painful adjustment are everywhere in a country that has become increasingly middle class over the last generation.
Sales of cars, televisions, houses and apartments have dropped sharply in the last few months.
Distribucion y Servicio, the country's largest supermarket chain and retailer, originally intended to open nine new stores next year, but now plans to open only two.
The economy, which grew by more than 7 percent in 1997, will grow by only 4 percent this year.
That would not be bad if most of the growth had not come before June.

A zero-to-negative growth rate for the fourth quarter is expected by most economists to remain constant for at least the first half of 1999.
Unemployment has increased to 6.9 percent from 6.5 percent in the last year, and Government economists predict a continuing deterioration to at least 8.5 percent by June.
''We've had to change our projections four times, and now we'll be lucky to reach a growth rate of 1.5 percent.''
But for all the bad news, a consensus has emerged among local businessmen and economists, Government officials and Wall Street experts: Chile should rebound in the second half of next year, unless a Brazilian financial collapse shakes the entire South American economy or if Gen. Augusto Pinochet's extradition proceedings in London should set off political turbulence here.

The experts note that the Chilean peso has remained stable, the local stock market has revived in recent months and the Central Bank has lowered interest rates several times during the last two months after several rate increases earlier in the year that stalled the construction and retail sectors.
While the flow of foreign investment has slowed, Exxon and Procter and Gamble have recently announced major new investments.
And unlike several Asian economies that have been shaken by the collapses of weak banks, strong Government regulation and the emergence of many foreign banks in recent years have kept the Chilean financial sector sound.
Chile's percentage of past-due loans to total loans is projected to be a modest 2 percent by the end of the year, compared with 13 percent in Argentina and 5 percent in Brazil, according to a report by Santander Investment.
''We have an economy that's decelerating very sharply,'' said Jose de Gregorio, an economist at the University of Chile.
''But over all, the country is strong.
It's an open economy, there's low corruption and the financial system remains strong.''
Nevertheless, to the desert towns like Tierra Amarilla that depend on small copper mines, a recovery looks like a mirage.
Four of eight local mining companies have closed in the last year here, and a persistent drought has slowed a transition to grape farming.
Domingo Cortes, 49, a copper miner, has seen his earnings drop from $250 to $180 a month, forcing him to take up seasonal tomato and onion farming to supplement his living.
''I'm always in debt,'' he said, while hammering rocks looking for blue veins of copper.
''One month I pay the electricity bill, another I pay the store.
It will be a very different Christmas this year.
I had to tell my children they won't be getting presents.''

The Fed is scheduled to meet next on Jan. 30 and 31, and analysts said there is a good chance of a rate cut then, especially if there are further signs that the economy is weakening.
''The purpose of the announcement today was to assure businesses and households that the Fed is not blind to the evidence of and concern over the slowing economy,'' said Joel Prakken, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisors in St. Louis.
''They're signaling that should it become necessary to do so, they are prepared to lower interest rates.''
''The drag on demand and profits from rising energy prices, as well as eroding consumer confidence, reports of substantial shortfalls in sales and earnings and stress in some segments of the financial markets suggest that economic activity may be slowing further,'' the committee said in a statement issued about 2:15 p.m.
''While some inflation risks persist, they are diminished by the more moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence of any indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased,'' the committee said.
Using words that signaled the formal adoption of a presumption that the Fed would soon have to consider cutting rates -- a 180-degree turnabout from its previous position -- the committee said it ''believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.''
Although the Fed has been trying for a year and a half to cool down what had been an overheated economy, the abruptness of the slowdown over the last month or so has clearly caught it by surprise.
In its report on conditions in the Federal Reserve districts earlier this month, the Fed noted no signs of real trouble, saying only that some regions were reporting slower growth and others moderate but steady growth.
And at its last meeting, on Nov. 15, the Fed concluded that ''the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures.''
The sharp deceleration has left Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues approaching circumstances that give central bankers nightmares: realizing that they may have raised rates too much, requiring them to do a quick about-face in hopes of averting a stall that would drive up unemployment, sink the stock market and set off finger pointing about who is to blame.

What is particularly inducing fear for the Fed is the possibility, remote at this point but still real, that it could face an upturn in inflation because of higher energy costs and low unemployment at the same time growth slows to a crawl or goes into reverse.

President-elect George W. Bush has been warning for the last two weeks that there may be a downturn just ahead, and that his proposal for a $1.3 trillion tax cut over the next decade is just the prescription for a faltering economy.
Mr. Bush and his team have cited rising energy prices in particular as a cause for concern.
A report in The Wall Street Journal on Monday suggesting that the Fed would seriously consider a rate cut today generated hope among investors who see a declining interest rate environment as the best tonic for the pessimism that has gripped the markets in recent weeks.
Regalia, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
It has left the rate unchanged since then.
The rate increases were intended to slow the growth in economic output from above 5 percent a year, well beyond what most economists think is sustainable over the long run without igniting inflation, to something closer to 3 percent.
Growth now appears to be running about 2.5 percent, a subdued but still healthy rate.
As the Fed suggested today, however, there are plenty of reasons to think that the growth rate could fall further.

Perhaps more important, confidence among both investors and consumers appears to be deteriorating.
If left unchecked, that could lead to more concrete economic problems.
''If psychology goes decidedly south, the real numbers will follow,'' Mr.
''That's what the Fed was trying to address, and it's why they went from an anti-inflation bias to a progrowth bias without a stop at neutral.''
But if the Fed wants to avert a meltdown in the markets, it is clearly not unhappy to see the speculative froth skimmed off stock prices.
Indeed, some Fed officials may not be particularly displeased with where the economy is now, given their desire to make sure that inflationary forces do not get a toehold.
Consumer price inflation by some measures has been creeping up.
Average hourly earnings have been accelerating.
The sharp rise in natural gas prices will put pressure on both businesses and consumers.
''On the one hand, growth has slowed, maybe more sharply than most were expecting, and the economy in those circumstances is vulnerable to recession,'' Mr. Prakken said.
''On the other hand, it's foolish to argue that the inflation risks have evaporated.''
Correction Appended
For years, investors have been trained to believe that whenever the financial markets turn particularly stormy, Alan Greenspan can be counted on to calm the seas.
With the Nasdaq composite index down 54 percent from its March peak and the Dow Jones industrial average down 12 percent from its high of last January, investors are clearly experiencing more pain and less gain in their stock holdings than they are accustomed to.
So it seems utterly perplexing to many of them that when the Federal Reserve Board met on Tuesday, it didn't cut interest rates.
All its members could muster was a shift from an inclination to raise rates to a neutral monetary policy stance.
Shares of Cisco Systems, which had been viewed until recently as a safe haven among growth stocks, have lost 55 percent of their peak price.
Even so, the stock still trades at 61 times current earnings, nobody's idea of a discount.

''The problem we have to unwind now is the extraordinary amount of money that was crammed into technology stocks at the end of last year and beginning of this year,'' said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
It's going to be difficult to unwind that in a relatively normal manner.''
Mr. Meehan expects stocks to rebound today.
But an underlying fear remains among investors that the United States economy has rolled over and the best years are behind us.
''We're looking down, not up, in terms of how the economy is going to climb.''

''When you've had a cumulative growth rate that has been expanding at a much faster pace and you turn back on that growth rate, for some people it's going to feel like a capital-R recession,'' he said, even if it is only a slowdown in growth.
Much of the recent market turmoil is a result of investors trying to gauge the level of earnings growth they can expect from corporations next year.
A. Marshall Acuff Jr., a market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said: ''Investors are wondering, 'What can we count on and what can we value it at?'
It's kind of a moving target, and a lot of people in the market have never seen that before.''
Some strategists think that the more the market falls, the faster the Fed will move to cut rates.
Still, the reality that Mr. Greenspan is moving more slowly on rates than investors would like is a new and unpleasant idea for the markets to absorb.
''The Fed chairman took away the punch bowl and wants to make sure that everybody feels the headache before he brings it back again,'' Mr. Babson said.
Who knew Mr. Greenspan could be such a grinch?
The market was also buffeted by speculation that the Federal Reserve might cut short-term interest rates without waiting for its late-January policy meeting and that I.B.M.

But the broader stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, rose less than the Dow even though advancing S.& P. issues outnumbered declining ones by a wide margin, 330 to 158.
The S.& P. 500 finished up 10.12 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,274.86, recovering about one-quarter of Wednesday's retreat.
(This is the time of year when funds distribute capital gains.)
Richard Cripps of Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore described yesterday's market as ''very tentative,'' with many retail investors moving money to bonds from stocks or to more conservative, less expensive stocks from technology.
''But the major problem,'' he added, ''is a slowing economy and slowing earnings.''
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.41 percent from 5.40 percent on Wednesday.
The gains came in relatively heavy volume for the last trading day before Christmas, with 1.09 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.

I.B.M.
Yesterday's rebound, however, cannot be read as a signal that the stock market has finally hit bottom.
That still depends on how much more the economy slows and how quickly the Federal Reserve moves to stimulate growth by cutting its short-term interest rate target.
''I don't believe that we have seen the bottom,'' said Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities.
''The news on earnings is still very negative, surprisingly negative for an earnings bear, which I have been for eight months.
My numbers are probably too high.''
Mr. McManus also said that President-elect George W. Bush's comments about the possibility of a recession and disagreement from the Clinton White House are not helpful for consumers or stocks.
''It is not encouraging to see politicians arguing over the state of the economy,'' he said.
In addition, investors still have to get through another week or so of fourth-quarter earnings preannouncements in the first part of January.
If the negative tone of this month's announcements continues, stocks could be pushed lower.
With just four more trading days to go in the year, the Dow is down 7.5 percent, which would be its worst performance since 1981.
The Nasdaq is down 38.2 percent, on the way to its worst performance in its history.
And the S.& P. 500-stock index is off 11.1 percent, its worst year since 1977.

While Fed policy makers unexpectedly shifted their bias to cutting interest rates from raising them at their Tuesday meeting, they have not yet cut their benchmark federal funds rate from 6.5 percent.
Given the recent signs of the economy's slowing, more economists and analysts are saying the Fed will cut interest rates when policy makers meet at the end of January.
The Fed rarely moves on interest rates between formal policy-making meetings.
But it has done so, most recently in the fall of 1998, during the Russian financial crisis.

''I think the market will definitely be extremely disappointed if the Fed does not cut rates by Groundhog Day,'' Mr. McManus said.
Several government reports yesterday added to the portrait of an economy that has slowed sharply from the 5 percent growth pace of 1999 and the first half of this year.
Although the increase was a little larger than the 1.5 percent expected, it still reflects how wary consumers have become.
But much of the increase went to pay for higher utility bills, which analysts say have been cutting into spending for household and other goods and holiday gifts.
The slowing growth and the prospect of a Fed rate cut before the end of January helped drive Treasury interest rates lower in a trading session shortened by a holiday.
That is its lowest yield since February 1999, when longer-term interest rates were rising after reaching 30-year lows in October 1998.
But now the euro has jumped almost 12 percent against the dollar since its record low in October, including an increase yesterday to 92.52 cents from 91.43 cents on Thursday.
At this level, the euro is already as high as some forecasters predicted it would rise in 2001.
At some level, this history inhabits people's minds, marking one of the fundamental transatlantic cultural divides.

Why has the nation -- in many ways an artificial construct on Europe's mottled soil -- so completely obscured an older reality of mingling?
Taher Ben Jelloun, a French author of Moroccan descent, sees one problem in the history of empire and the relationship of colonizer to colonized.
''For the French, in North Africa the relationship was always one of domination and exploitation,'' he said, ''and even decades later this troubled memory makes full acceptance of the North African difficult.''
Similarly, Europe's long memory of repetitive war against Islam and the Ottoman Turks no doubt plays into wide prejudice against Muslims.
Still, even bad imperial history provides the French and British with long experience of cohabitation with foreign cultures, whereas the Germans -- who lack this experience -- often seem less able to imagine an integrative model of society.
''Nationalism is ridiculous in an open world,'' said Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, a member of a high-level committee reviewing immigration in Germany.
''But people still say to me: why don't we just chuck the foreigners out?''
Europe is at a crossroads where it is being asked to define its identity.
Over the past year, it has had to confront a series of disasters -- 58 dead Chinese migrants in the back of truck in Dover, 59 immigrants lost in a dinghy off Italy, the corpses of more than 100 Moroccans washed up on the beaches of southern Spain -- that testify to its lure and the desperation of those trying to get in.
But, at some fundamental level, the continent is uncertain that it wants, or can accommodate, these foreigners.
''It is very delicate to say that we need immigrants, because perhaps 60 percent of Germans still have a certain resistance to the idea,'' Otto Schily, Germany's Social Democratic interior minister, said in an interview.
The nation was a unifying idea imposed on diffuse history, and the German imagination -- like that of many other European states -- still longs for homogeneity, whatever the abundant evidence to the contrary.
But these attitudes now pose an acute quandary.
Europe is full of immigrants and needs more if it is not to become moribund.
But governments are also aware of an uncomfortable truth: surrounded by countries like Turkey and Morocco, with high birth rates and huge youth populations, Europe is certain to face immigrant pressure over the coming years that may be uncontrollable.
Mobility is greater than ever before; no wall divides the continent any longer.
A salary of $100 a month south of the Mediterranean becomes $1,000 on a fruit or vegetable farm on the European side.
EUROPE will also be involved, at the other end of the economic scale, in the global quest for the best and the brightest -- whether Sri Lankan or Nigerian -- that characterizes an information economy.
But the readiness to confront, let alone embrace, these realities appears limited.
Indeed the politics of xenophobic innuendo are enjoying a revival.
Take Germany, where more than seven million foreigners live, or about 9 percent of the population.
This has been the year of renascent German pride, or patriotism, or bigotry -- the distinction is not always clear.
The opposition Christian Democrats, for example, speak of Leitkultur, or guiding culture -- a potpourri of Christian and Enlightenment values to which immigrants are being asked to conform.
The message is clear enough: a complicit wink to that broad swath of Germans who do not like living with more than two million Islamic Turks, believe such ''guest workers'' should go home one day and still think the German Volk is defined by blood.

Similar trends are evident elsewhere.
Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of Italy's center-right Forza Italia, said that illegal immigrants ''all too often swell the ranks of organized crime.''
In Austria, Jorg Haider's governing Freedom Party has made made much of ''Uberfremdung,'' literally ''over-foreignerization,'' and Britain's conservative leader, William Hague, likes to assail the asylum-seekers living off the country's welfare.
Why this refocusing of fear?
In part, center-right parties, facing a left that has occupied the economic center and with no cold war left to fight, have been casting around for a new agenda.
They have found it in threatened national identity.
In part, European countries, including Italy and Spain and Greece, are struggling with the profound adjustment to their national psyches involved in viewing themselves as countries of immigration, as they have become, rather than emigration, as they always thought they were.
There are other factors.
High birth rates in the developing world combined with the so-called Baby Bust in Europe have fed shadowy concerns about being overwhelmed by foreign hordes.
Europeans fret that their generous welfare systems cannot support a tide of newcomers who, unlike those in the United States, qualify for a range of benefits as soon as they arrive.
Free housing, free medicine and free education are norms.
''The social standard in major receiving countries is higher than in the United States, and a relatively much larger share of social welfare benefits are spent on immigrants,'' said Kay Hailbronner, an immigration expert.
''This creates resentments.''
Such comprehensive welfare lifts wage bills, so unemployment has remained high, even as the European economy has picked up over the past year.
About 15 million people, or 9.2 percent of the population, remain out of work.
In this context, the foreigner often appears as a threat.
Contrast this with an America of full employment where employers clamor for more foreign-born workers.
In addition, globalization and the very process of European integration built around the shared euro currency feed fears about loss of national identity.
The fears may prove costly.
David Hale, the chief economist at Zurich Financial Services, argues that one reason the United States may continue to outperform Europe lies in ''its demographic characteristics and high tolerance for immigration.''
''During the next 10 years,'' he said, ''the working age population of Japan will decline by 6 percent, in Europe it will stagnate at best, and in the United States it will expand by at least 10 percent.''
The potential result: a Europe short of labor and struggling to finance retirement payments.

But a European reaction may be at hand.
Europeans often argue that their cohesive social model must be defended against the raw social fragmentation of American multiculturalism; they tend to insist that immigrants adapt to local culture rather than introduce new ones.
But they are looking closely at one American idea.
Several governments are coming around to the view that a model similar to the American H-1B visa -- allowing skilled foreign workers into the country -- needs to be adopted.
In the United States, this program has been expanded to allow in 585,000 workers over the next three years.
Germany has now offered 20,000 so-called green cards for qualified foreigners.
This would mark a shift, albeit small, toward controlled immigration and away from the policies that have made family reunion, asylum-seeking and illegality the only roads into Fortress Europe.
But the deeper problem appears political and cultural.
''Politicians have forced us into parallel societies by denying for so long that we existed and pretending for so long that we would go home,'' said Safet Cinar, who heads an association of the 130,000 Turks in Berlin.
THE problem of immigration in Europe has existed for a long time.
Global culture, economics, demography and reactionary politics have now brought it to a head.
The corpses on Europe's borders demonstrate its gravity.
In his pioneering 19th-century book on nationalism, ''What is a Nation?
Paraphrasing Renan, it may be asked, at the beginning of the 21st century, how a nascent United States of Europe hopes to further the peace and prosperity that the European Union has brought without overcoming the enduring prejudice that divides Christianity and Islam and without burying, once and for all, the ethnic bigotry that has little basis in a multinational history and has so repeatedly plunged the continent into war.
An Iranian passport, for example, goes for $250 with the original photograph in it, or $350 with your own photo inserted and a forged official Iranian stamp applied to it.
Western passports are far more desirable and expensive -- a Danish one costs $9,000 and an American one $14,000 -- but the Iranian document has its uses.

For the migrants gathered here -- from northern Iraq, from North Africa, from central Asia, all of them desperate to get into the European Union -- an Iranian passport offers visa-free travel to Bosnia.
From there, illegal access to Western Europe is available in the backs of trucks headed to Austria from Sarajevo.
Poverty, high birth rates and the new routes from Asia to Europe opened by the fall of the Berlin Wall all encourage the tide of human traffic through Turkey.
So, too, does global communication.
Here in Istanbul, as in much of the developing world, Western cable television eradicates distance as it conveys images that seduce: plush homes, scrubbed children, gleaming cars, faces soft and pouting.
Their lure to the unwashed, living on $200 a month or less, is irresistible.
Certainly, Mr. Erriad, 27, could not resist.
He came here from Casablanca two months ago in a roundabout attempt to reach Italy, where four of his brothers work.
Like most European countries, Italy is trying to curb the so-called ''family unification'' that brings more immigrants.
The fastest illegal route from Morocco to Europe is the nine-mile sea journey in small boats from northern Morocco to Spain -- Europe's Rio Grande.
But it is a perilous passage to the promised land that has already cost more than 100 lives this year and led to the arrest of 15,000 immigrants, four times as many as in 1999.
''I can't swim,'' he explained.
So this young Moroccan, a driver who reckons that he will quintuple his salary in Italy, flew to Istanbul and bought himself an Iranian passport, preparing to fly to Bosnia and then make his way to Italy overland.
Now he sits in a small hotel room with a droning television and offers a visitor another Iranian passport, on which he will earn a $30 commission.
A few hours later, the document is handed over in the street by a young, bespectacled Palestinian, who says good evening but asks no questions.
A resident of Kuwait, according to the passport stamps, he entered Turkey on Nov. 12.

''The passport was either sold by its owner, lost or stolen,'' said Ahmed Sulun, the manager of a small Laleli hotel who has long observed the trade surrounding migrant attempts to move westward.
''This kind of thing goes on all the time.''
Mr. Erriad has a friend, a Tunisian woman named Noura Feyala, age 22, who is also trying to get to Europe.
She says simply: ''I am proud to be Tunisian, proud to be a Muslim, proud to be an Arab.
But I am not proud of my passport.
I cannot even see my uncle in Paris or my cousin in Madrid.''
Everything is mobile -- images, capital, information -- so people see no reason why they should not be too.
Immigrants seep into Turkey, seen as a bridge to Europe.
''The political instability and turmoil that marks our neighbors makes Turkey a desirable transit country for those who want to reach Western Europe through illegal means,'' Hikmet Sami Turk, the Turkish justice minister, said recently.
But thousands more are never caught and many, like Mr. Erriad or Ms. Feyala, are in Turkey legally looking for a less-than-legal means to move to the West.
Turkish organizations specialize in that business.
The gangs are generally small, ranging from 5 to 20 people, and are often made up of extended families or clans.

Charging between $1,000 and $4,000 to move people to Western Europe from Turkey, those organizations quickly build up large amounts of cash that are invested in stolen luxury cars, property, restaurants and illegal activities including drug smuggling.
The Turkish authorities contend that a ''terrorist organization'' -- an oblique reference to the Kurdistan Workers Party -- is active in these areas.
Many borrow money to pay such crime rings to move them.
A 37-year-old port worker who would give only his first name, Sukru, paid $2,500, all borrowed, to a gang last year to be taken to Germany.
''I am nearly 40,'' he said.
He has a son and daughter, ages 11 and 7.
There, the group was hidden in the back of a truck and taken over the border into Poland before being put on a train to the Polish border opposite the German town of Frankfurt an der Oder.

Two gang members accompanied them along the banks of the Oder River at night before leaving them with instructions on where to swim across into Germany.
After making contact with a Turkish company there, he was able to borrow some money and make his way back to Turkey.
''But in the end you realize that you have no recourse and that like heroin traffickers, they are ready to kill you at any moment.''
But why risk so much to try to get to Europe?
''Europe is life, humanity, everything,'' Sukru said.
''You feel you are a human being in Europe.
In Istanbul I feel hardly more valuable than an animal.
But Europe is like a fortress.''
He earns about $180 a month carrying loads in the port.
He will try again, perhaps using another route.
A nephew recently got into Western Europe from Bosnia, paying $2,000 to be taken in the back of a truck from Sarajevo.
''You must realize that these gangs are making enormous amounts of money.
More than in a factory.''
And while the rewards are great, the punishments are much lighter than for drug smuggling.
Mr. Erriad from Morocco is also considering other means to reach Europe.
He recently bought a plane ticket from Istanbul to Casablanca via Zurich, with the idea of trying to alight during the Swiss stopover.
''Everything is being tightened up,'' he said.

Turkey has recently added extra border posts at its frontiers, increased the number of border guards, tightened inspections in various Aegean ports, started sharing intelligence on human smuggling with other countries including Italy and Bosnia, and begun new training for guards.
Eager to become a member of the European Union, the country is determined to show its law enforcement credentials.
The European Union, meanwhile, is reviewing whether a policy that seems only to push more and more people into seeking illegal entry needs to be changed, especially as the Union's estimates suggest that as many as 35 million immigrants may be needed by 2025 to offset an aging population.
But any suggestion that the doors may be opened is sure to be seized on by center-right politicians across the continent.
In Italy, Silvio Berlusconi suggested this year that coast guards should be allowed to open fire on the boats bringing illegal immigrants from the Albanian and Turkish coasts.
Of course, the people on those boats and in the backs of trucks are there because of their desperate conviction that only in the West does a decent future beckon.
''If a child is born in France,'' asked Ms. Feyala, the woman from Tunisia, ''does the child automatically get French citizenship?''
Asked why, she said only, ''I want my child to live well.''

Violence against wives is a common problem in India, as it is in many societies.
More than half of married women justified wife-beating in a recently released survey of 90,000 women sponsored by India's Health Ministry, most commonly for neglecting housekeeping and child-rearing duties, showing disrespect to in-laws, going out without a husband's permission or arousing a husband's suspicions of infidelity.
Dozens of surveys taken around the world have found that from 10 to 50 percent of women have experienced domestic violence -- and that the most common reasons were related to wifely shortcomings.
Twelve percent of the women said they had been harassed for dowry, which is generally given at the time of engagement and marriage but is sometimes demanded later.

''Until we get away from burning and dowry, we'll never get close to understanding violence against women,'' said Veena Talwar Oldenberg, a historian at the City University of New York and an expert on the dowry death phenomenon.
But the police, prosecutors and judges have tended to try to squeeze women's accounts of violence into the box of dowry harassment, researchers say.
For that and many other reasons, efforts to prosecute dowry-related violence end with the vast majority of defendants acquitted, official statistics show.
While dowry deaths, including suicides and murders, have risen to 6,975 in 1998 from 4,648 in 1995, according to official figures, researchers and others in the legal system say they believe domestic violence cases are often inaccurately classified as dowry deaths.
For three years Pratima, a plump, sprightly young woman with a robust sense of righteous indignation, has moved briskly through the Victoria Hospital burn ward, asking the charred, fatally wounded women there why they were burned.

She is a caseworker for Vimochana, a women's organization that tracks the cases of married women who die unnatural deaths each year in Bangalore, more than half from burns.
Their stories of despair are as varied as the bad marriages that produced them.
But by far the most common stories -- related by more than half of the women -- involved drunken, abusive husbands, often irregularly employed.
There is evidence that stoves can be deadly.
Cheap pump-action kerosene stoves, used mainly by the urban poor, are the most dangerous, say surgeons and experts.
R. B. Ahuja, a surgeon who is secretary of the National Academy of Burns in India, an association of burn doctors, estimates that perhaps a quarter of the injuries he sees are a result of accidents with kerosene pump stoves.
Pratima and Gurumurthy, the doctor who heads the Victoria Hospital burn ward, believe that most of the burn cases they see are actually attempted murders or suicides, but that the women, fearful and dependent on their in-laws, keep the secret.
Often a woman like Geetha starts out saying she was burned in a kitchen accident, only to later change her story.
That is why some women's advocates here resist the idea that thousands of mostly poor women are dying in stove accidents every year.
Women's groups are pushing for new laws to combat domestic violence.
The government is considering a bill that would enable a woman to initiate civil proceedings against an abusive relative and obtain a court order of protection.

Experience suggests that the Fed can almost always persuade consumers and businesses to spend more by cutting interest rates, but that there's a longish lag between the rate cut and the spending increase.
And that's why we're still vulnerable to recessions: now and then the Fed gets behind the curve, failing to recognize a weakening economy until it's too late to prevent a slump.
That's what happened in 1990; it may be what's happening now.
Of course, I'm talking with the benefit of hindsight; it seemed like a good idea at the time.

The Fed can and almost surely will reverse that rate hike sometime soon, but the favorable effects of that reversal on spending will take time to materialize.
Meanwhile the economy will slow, and could shrink for a couple of quarters, which is the technical definition of a recession.
But it should be only a temporary setback -- which brings us to the difference between ourselves and Japan.
In Japan, the sky really is falling.
Because the interest rate is already very close to zero (it isn't quite zero, because of the Bank of Japan's foolish decision to raise rates back in August -- but don't get me started), the slowdown is a sign that the nation's basic economic policies aren't working, and that it is long past time to do something radical.
By contrast, our slowdown is just one of those things that happen now and then; it doesn't indicate any fundamental flaws in our economic policy, any need to do anything except cut interest rates.
So what should we be afraid of?
The nightmare scenario, which cannot be completely ruled out, is that we will turn out to be more like Japan than we think -- that we have just gone through our own version of the infamous ''bubble economy,'' and that we are about to find out that this time cutting interest rates won't do the trick.
But at this point that scenario isn't very plausible.
What worries me is not the recession that we may or may not be about to experience; it is the way that our politicians are likely to react to that slowdown.
Will they use a mild, easily treated ailment as an excuse to force expensive, dangerous quack remedies down the nation's throat?
I am, of course, talking about tax cuts -- which won't cure the short-term slowdown, and will undermine our long-run fiscal health.
We don't need to fear a recession; if it does happen, it's something that the Fed can easily cure.
What we do need to fear is fear itself: the all-too-likely prospect that the threat of recession will panic us into doing things we will regret for years to come.

It did not.
To deal with a world no longer dominated by nuclear rivalries, Mr. Clinton would place a brand of economic diplomacy at the core of his foreign policy.
The man who came to office criticizing President George Bush for putting commerce ahead of human rights ended up arguing, quite passionately, that the spread of American-style capitalism would eventually help spread American-style democracy.
Particularly after his re-election in 1996, Mr. Clinton supported the use of economic enticements to bring about political change, including lifting cold war embargoes, signing more than 300 trade agreements and even teaching countries the basics of contract law.
Whether he was in an Irish village, a Vietnamese industrial park or at Beijing University, the message was the same: Prosperity would create choices, choices would lead to a demand for information, and that information, provided at the speed of the Internet, would bring political change.
In time, perhaps, dictatorships and one-party rule would fall.
Mr. Clinton will leave office with the experiment under way but the thesis unproven.
Some of the fledgling successes he has nudged along, like Poland and South Korea, were well along the path before he came to office.
Others that began the trip toward democracy have since floundered.
At moments it seemed that Mr. Clinton's approach would backfire at home.
The danger faded, but even today, there is a sense of precariousness in the world economy, with the American economy slowing while Japan remains in a recession.
His boldest experiments at using economic incentives to achieve democratic reforms have been in China and Russia.
Critics have called them failures, but the administration has argued that the verdict is still out.
In China, the market economy has flourished, and state-owned enterprises are changing or have closed.
For his part, Mr. Clinton wants to be remembered as the man who pushed China toward capitalism, just as President Richard M. Nixon is remembered for opening links to China and President Jimmy Carter for normalizing relations.
Mr. Clinton argued that the accord would spark political openness, but in Beijing, leaders believe they can enjoy the benefits of market reform without loosening their political grip, and by some accounts, they have imprisoned more dissenters than during the Tiananmen crackdown.
Now Russia's inability to compete appeared to be causing a return to the days of central control and sporadic challenges to American power.
Job No.
1 was using diplomatic power to open markets for American goods, helping to create jobs and lift the United States out of a recession.
The next year, he used the same strategy to win passage of the largest global trade deal in history, establishing the W.T.O.
as the arbiter of world trade.
Traditional Democrats struck back by denying Mr. Clinton the authority to negotiate trade accords that Congress could not alter.
Labor and environmental groups got even five years later in Seattle by sinking his next major trade initiative.
But Japan's sinking economy made much of the agreement worthless.
''People looked and said, 'How much are we getting for this?'
Moreover, the American economy was taking off, easing the pressure on Mr. Clinton to reverse trade deficits.
''If engagement is only for commerce, you will not be enhancing your interests,'' Mr. Berger concluded.
''If we use it to press nonproliferation and human rights, then it advances our interests and reaffirms the theory.''
Old trouble spots -- the Middle East, Iraq, Northern Ireland -- would not go away, and they remained immune to economic incentives.
In dealing with the Middle East, Mr. Clinton drew praise from supporters and detractors for his tenacity and his mastery of the history and politics of the region.
Even so, in the last hours of his administration, he was still trying to negotiate a settlement in the Middle East.

Mr. Clinton was also criticized as failing to articulate clear standards about when America should cede power and when it should use it.
Michael Mandelbaum, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, dismissed the administration's approach to peacekeeping as ''foreign policy as social work.''
Nothing in the foreign policy manuals tells you how to deal with these, and it took more than a little nerve.''

And for months, the fund made the situation worse for the poor, requiring cuts in social programs before it would provide loans to forestall default.

By early 1998 rioting broke out in Indonesia, and soon its dictator of three decades, Suharto, was ousted.
But opinions have shifted.
Mr. Clinton gets much of the credit.
Probably.''
But Mr. Rubin says, ''Whatever money we spent, it was worth it for a world in which we are not now in a nuclear standoff.''
Similarly the much-talked-about effort to build a ''global financial architecture'' has faded.
There have been some changes -- countries now must reveal more financial information to investors, and the monetary fund has changed many of its lending practices -- but even the president has stopped talking about redesigning the world's financial system.
Eventually the backlash from the crisis came full circle, colliding with Mr. Clinton's free-market dreams.
But poorer nations often found that their products could not compete and that their low-tech exports were subject to tariffs and quotas that American, European and Japanese industries would not eliminate.
So when the United States proposed a further opening of world markets, developing nations struck back, starting in Seattle in late November 1999.

Trade ministers were gathering for a new round of global trade talks.
Charlene Barshefsky, Mr. Clinton's trade representative and an advocate of using trade accords for political ends, peered out the window of a suite in the Westin Hotel.
''Where are the barricades?''
For months, unions, environmental groups, rights activists and others had been planning to grind the meeting to a halt, to make the point that their issues were being ignored.
In an effort to appease the protesters and help Mr. Gore in the coming election, the president arrived in Seattle and began talking about establishing labor and environmental standards for all nations.
In an interview a few weeks ago, Mr. Clinton said: ''A lot of the people in these developing countries who were marching are mad at America because we, almost alone among the advanced countries, would like to have a global trading system that has minimum labor and environmental standards.
And so a lot of them thought that's my indirect way of being a protectionist, in protecting the good jobs in America and keeping them poor.''
Ms. Barshefsky pressed on, piecing together an agreement with Jordan meant to spur trade in the Middle East, and negotiating the deal of her political life, the one with China.
The China accord could eventually redefine the United States' relationship with Beijing.
And if Mr. Clinton is right, it could result in the erosion of the Communist Party's control.
He argued exactly that, as he was selling Congress on the merits of the deal, making his now-familiar pitch that ''in the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem.''
But even as China has opened up economically, the State Department has documented six years of intensifying crackdowns on dissent.
Elsewhere in the world, Mr. Clinton has adjusted his pitch.
In the past year, he has talked far more about the fate of the poor.
This sounded big-hearted, but it was also rooted in a new reality: The world's developing nations were gaining clout by forming coalitions.
''They are now willing to say, We are not going to do it the American way,'' one Clinton adviser said.
''The Bush people are about to find that out.''
''We have seen the collapse of the U.S.S.R.,'' he told Mr. Clinton, and yet ''we are still on our feet, we have reaffirmed socialism.''
The Vietnamese leader's message was clear: Just because we trade with you, don't expect us to embrace democracy.

Which side will prevail?
''I don't think there's any way for us to bring openness and freedom to China or Vietnam more quickly than the one we've adopted,'' Mr. Clinton said later.
But he added: ''I don't think freedom is inevitable, or the triumph of democracy is inevitable.
But I think it is rendered far more likely by the power of our example and the strength of our engagement.''
Investors say Mr. Thompson is making sensible decisions, but until they see evidence that the company is back on track, they are reluctant to give him the benefit of the doubt.

''I admire Ken Thompson's candor and honesty,'' said Thomas Finucane, a portfolio manager of John Hancock's Regional Bank Fund, a longtime shareholder.
''But investors have lost a lot of money in the stock.
Management needs to restore its credibility.''
To be sure, Mr. Thompson faces some daunting challenges.
Retail banking, which accounts for 30 percent of operating profits, is a mature business, with consumers continuing to shift assets out of savings accounts and into brokerage firms.
Since 1994, the bank has been aggressively diversifying into the brokerage, money management and capital markets businesses, which in recent years have been fast-growing areas.
But these are linked to the economy and financial markets, and, at least in the near term, are not likely to deliver the profits the bank had anticipated.
Mr. Thompson acknowledges the markets will slow his plans, but is confident that in time he will win investors over.
''I'd love for the stock to be at $50 a share, but I don't go home and beat myself up,'' he said in an interview at the bank's Charlotte, N.C., headquarters earlier this month.
''I can't emphasize enough how focused we are on creating shareholder value.''
Last week, Mr. Thompson demonstrated this focus, announcing that he was cutting First Union's annual dividend of $1.92 a share in half, saving $1 billion annually.
''We heard specifically from a number of shareholders that a stronger balance sheet and lower dividend payout would be attractive to them,'' he said.
Mr. Thompson, who comes across as earnest and determined, is not nearly as charismatic as First Union's previous chief executive, Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., who in 16 years took what was once a sleepy North Carolina bank through a dizzying 82 acquisitions, building a retail banking franchise that extends across 11 states.
Two of Mr. Crutchfield's later deals sent First Union into a tailspin it is still trying to recover from.
In November 1997, it acquired the CoreStates Financial Corporation in Philadelphia for $20 billion, paying a record six times book value -- to this day the highest such multiple paid in a large banking deal, according to SNL Securities, a Charlottesville, Va., research firm.

By 1999, problems stemming from the CoreStates deal hit First Union's bottom line.
The bank could have left it to analysts to comb through the document and find the information for themselves.
It must have been frustrating for First Union's executives to see analysts so easily distracted.
But while analysts have been busy handicapping First Union's potential loan losses, an ultimately more important question is how well positioned the bank's businesses are, particularly in a softening economy.
Mr. Thompson has made progress fixing the retail banking franchise, and the bank's brokerage and money management business is doing well.
But the outlook for capital markets, still a work in progress, is clouded by the recent downturn on Wall Street.

First Union has started to correct the problem.
Retail deposits are up 0.6 percent from February through the end of October, according to a bank spokeswoman.
The retail bank should benefit from an expected decline in interest rates.
Still, even in the best of situations, Mr. Thompson is aiming for earnings growth of 6 percent from this business over an economic cycle.
While retail banking seems on the right track, Mr. Thompson is hitting turbulence in the capital markets.
First Union is confronting a slowdown on Wall Street, particularly in corporate lending, which accounts for more than half the division's revenue.
It has captured a respectable share of the lending market, and is ranked fourth among lenders to highly indebted companies, up from 11th place five years ago, according to preliminary data from the Loan Pricing Corporation, a research firm.
But the business is in a cyclical slowdown, as a weakening economy makes it difficult for borrowers to meet obligations.
Not only are new loans scarce but after the Sunbeam disclosure, investors worry that First Union will be forced to mark down more loans on its books.
Mr. Thompson says these fears are overblown, noting that the next largest nonperforming loan on the bank's books is less than one-tenth the size of Sunbeam's.
Still, even a pile of smallish loans could hurt earnings.
In its other Wall Street businesses, First Union has made minimal progress despite the long bull market.
It ranks 14th among underwriters of high-yield bonds this year, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data, and just 32nd among advisers to mergers valued at $250 million or less, the market singled out by First Union.
(The bank says a lot of the deals it works on are private and therefore are not credited in the rankings.)
It is ranked just 38th among equity underwriters.
First Union has been in the equity business less than three years, and while it is rarely the lead banker, it has garnered some co-manager slots on stock offerings.
But the business is still operating at a loss, a First Union spokeswoman confirmed.

''We don't measure our success by league tables,'' Mr. Thompson said, referring to Wall Street rankings, but he said the bank was looking to slow expense growth in the area.
''We still see capital markets as a growth engine for us, but there will certainly be less growth in the short to intermediate term,'' he said.
The most stable of First Union's businesses is capital management, which includes brokerage accounts and money management.
The division has $173 billion in assets under management, up from $47 billion in 1995.
First Union is now the nation's sixth-largest brokerage firm, and its $86 billion Evergreen Funds division is the 20th-largest mutual fund family, according to bank statistics.
While First Union has been an active acquirer of mutual fund and brokerage firms, nearly 25 percent of the division's growth has been from market appreciation, said Donald McMullen Jr., head of capital management.
That growth could slow in the near term, he acknowledges, amid a choppy market climate.
Mr. Thompson is promising earnings growth of 15 percent annually from capital markets and capital management, but the markets' downturn means that goal is probably a few years away.
''We've hit a speed bump, as have others in the industry,'' he said.
''It will slow our progress, but it won't change our direction.''
Still, Mr. Thompson does not have an endless amount of time to execute his plan.
With a cheap stock and an enviable franchise in some of the wealthiest markets on the East Coast, some investors say the bank could prove a tempting takeover target.
The most likely buyer: FleetBoston Financial, which has a robust franchise in New England but is looking to expand in the mid-Atlantic region.
What may buy Mr. Thompson time is that Fleet probably cannot afford to do a deal right now.
While its stock has not performed nearly as poorly as First Union's, it is still trading at just 11 times expected earnings, making it a weak currency for deal making.
''First Union's management would be out of their minds to sell at the present time,'' says H. Rodgin Cohen, chairman of the New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and a longtime legal adviser to the bank.
''If I am right as to the value of the franchise, it is an absolute steal right now.''
Mr. Thompson says he has no plans to surrender control anytime soon.
''We think we can build shareholder value by instituting our own plan,'' he said.

For First Union and its competitors, a lot will depend on the health of the economy.
''We think all the bad news is in the stock.
It's a great franchise,'' says Alan Straus, an analyst for the Merrill Lynch Basic Value Fund, who has been adding to an existing stake in First Union.
''There's probably 50 percent upside from here, looking out two years.''
Still, he adds, ''If there's a serious recession, all bets are off.''
The curses floated all the way to the rafters, and soon there were flashing elbows and faces wrinkled in anger and a parade of players from the same team skating to the penalty box.

Parrish swept in a shot for his third goal in three games.
''It's good to see everybody score,'' Islanders Coach Butch Goring said, ''but these are the guys who are supposed to score.''
Now it is the Islanders' turn to play on back-to-back nights; they are scheduled to play host to Buffalo on Saturday.
''We know we have to keep working hard,'' Czerkawski said.
''We don't have big-caliber superstars to win games for us.''
SLAP SHOTS
Because of the predicted snowstorm, the Islanders said they would probably wait until noon Saturday to determine if their 7:05 p.m. game against Buffalo would be played.

Those who have down payments of 35 percent and are willing to pay the lender 60 percent of the home's future appreciation will get an interest rate that is 3 percentage points less than the prevailing interest rate, Mr. Bader said.
Those who have smaller down payments, or are willing to pay only a smaller part of any appreciation, will get smaller reductions.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But even a relatively small reduction in the interest rate can amount to a significant savings.
For example, a buyer making a 20 percent down payment on a $350,000 house would need a mortgage of $280,000.
The monthly payment on such a mortgage, for a term of 30 years at 8 percent interest, would be $2,054.54.
The same mortgage at 6.125 percent interest -- the amount that would be charged to a borrower with a 20 percent down payment who was willing to share 60 percent of future appreciation -- would be $1,701.30, a difference of $353.24 a month, or $4,238.88 a year.
And while a SAM can be used to lower a borrower's monthly payment, Mr. Bader said, it can also be used to increase the amount of house a borrower can buy.
For example, he said, a borrower who can afford a monthly payment of $2,054.54 -- the amount that would be required on a $280,000 loan at 8 percent -- could instead obtain a 6.125 percent shared appreciation mortgage of $340,000 for roughly the same monthly payment.
''You can then extrapolate out how much that affects the purchase price,'' he said, explaining that such a mortgage, with a 20 percent down payment, would allow the borrower to buy a house worth about $425,000.
There are, however, other factors to take into consideration when considering a SAM.
''If you're in the house for more than a couple of years, there is an excellent likelihood that you'll have a significant amount of appreciation, at least in this area of the country,'' he said.
While the homeowner may have saved $4,238.88 in mortgage payments with a SAM, he or she would have to pay roughly the same amount to the lender, based on 60 percent of that $7,000.

Accordingly, Mr. Schatsky said, any appreciation that exceeds 2 percent a year is likely to cost the homeowner money in the long run.
''Over extended periods of time it's not unusual to see two times that rate of appreciation in this area of the country,'' he said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Moreover, Mr. Schatsky said, while the homeowner is required to share his profit with the lender, the lender is not required to share in the expense of the sale.
''The homeowner ends up paying the entire brokerage commission and all attendant closing expenses himself,'' he said.
''The lender doesn't share the net profit; it shares the gross profit.''
Another provision of a shared appreciation mortgage, Mr. Schatsky said, allows homeowners to exempt from the appreciated value certain increases attributable to improvements they have made.
However, the improvement must cost more than $10,000 or 6 percent of the value of the home, whichever is greater.
For instance, a homeowner who makes a $22,000 improvement to a $350,000 house will not have to share the resulting increase in value with the lender because the cost of the improvement is more than 6 percent of the value of the home, or $21,000.
But a homeowner who makes two $11,000 improvements -- or even a single $20,000 improvement -- will have to share with the lender any appreciation in value resulting from those improvements because they are below the threshold.
Moreover, he said, homeowners who want to exempt appreciation attributable to improvements must notify the lender beforehand and must have appraisals conducted -- at their own expense -- both before and after the improvement is completed.
(Appraisals typically cost about $300 each.)
Finally, he said, it is not the cost of the improvement that is exempt, but only the increase in value attributable to the improvement.
More important, Mr. Schatsky said, those who choose not to sell their house at the end of the mortgage term will still have to come up with the money to pay the lender's share of any appreciated value.
The tax implications of a shared appreciation mortgage are another matter to consider.
Joel E. Miller, a Queens tax lawyer, said that since the shared appreciation payment that will be made when the house is sold is actually a deferred interest payment, most borrowers should be able to deduct a part of that on each year's tax return in addition to the actual amount of interest paid.
However, he said, if there is no appreciation to share with the lender when the house is sold, or if the appreciation is less than the amount expected, the borrower will most likely have to ''recapture'' any excess deductions claimed over the years on the deferred interest and report them as income at the time of sale.
Accordingly, Mr. Miller said, anyone contemplating a shared appreciation mortgage might want to consult tax lawyer or accountant.
The results of the migration and the many dollars sent back here are evident soon after a visitor passes the huge Western Union billboard that dwarfs the fading welcome sign that reads, in English and Spanish, ''Welcome to Intipuca City.''

The wood-and-tin houses outside the town limits give way to sturdy, freshly painted houses with elegant wrought-iron flourishes.
Along pothole-free streets paved with stones -- and named for one United States president, George Washington, and one former American ambassador -- there are pay phones on nearly every block and about as many wire transfer businesses.
Some men walk around with cellular phones, rather than the machetes of an earlier era, dangling from their belts.
And the annual harvest has been long forgotten by many in favor of the monthly vigil for remittances.
The streets have the lazy, empty feel of a permanent holiday.
''It has lifted up consumerism,'' Mr. Reyes said.
''The people are practically without anything to do, because they receive dollars.''
Emigre dollars have helped prop up many poorer nations, like Haiti, where construction is booming in some areas despite a battered local economy.
In El Salvador the Central Bank estimates that remittances from the United States will reach $1.6 billion this year, compared with $850 million in 1992.
The flow has helped the country amass significant dollar reserves.
That will come in handy now that the dollar can freely circulate alongside the colon at a fixed rate of $1 for 8.75 colons, stabilizing interest rates and eliminating conversion fees.
But some critics of the way this town has evolved said that while money-changers may lose out, the search for the dollar will continue to exact other costs from their society.
Almost every day, a few people embark on their journey northward with a visit to the Canales International Travel Agency.

''They go looking for the new horizon of paradise, even if it costs them being with their family,'' said Brigido Galea, the agency's manager.

They go to his agency to change their return tickets so they can leave sooner, thinking nothing of paying a fee of $75, nearly as much as a sugar worker earns in a month.
Very few have come back for good or to go into business here.
Some of those who left 25 years ago have retired here, living off their pensions and savings, sometimes turning a quick dollar making loans.
''The qualities of the hard-working Salvadoran of the 1970's is being lost,'' said Mr. Galea, who had just finished selling a one-way ticket to Houston.
''There are few people here who work in agriculture, business or construction.''
Jose Hernandez is one of the few locals who came back to open a business.
In the shadow of the AT&T billboard that towers over the town plaza, he runs a general store, which was doing a brisk business in prepaid phone cards for the holidays.
He spent 13 years cooking and washing dishes in restaurants in the Washington area before returning to Intipuca for good in 1997.

''They are so used to getting dollars they do not produce,'' he said.
''Last year, a newspaper published a survey that said the majority of the dollars that come here are spent on food, clothing and education.
But education is last.
It's one of the least significant areas.''
Some people see the changeover to the dollar as but one more step in the fading away of Salvadoran culture and sovereignty.
Mr. Reyes is not so alarmed about that, but he is not taking any chances.
Outside his center, a group of young people strummed guitars as part of a cultural workshop he has started with the help of a friend who works with young people in Washington.
He wants to do more, especially involving the young people, whose schooling is cut short when they leave to work in the States.
He is also worried about the lack of community spirit and the consumerism that overtake some of the emigres.

Still, high-quality corporate returns, up 9.1 percent, were so far below those for Treasury notes and bonds, up 13.4 percent, that the investment-grade corporate bond market -- despite the higher yields it always offers -- lost the performance edge it has enjoyed over Treasuries since the bond debacle of 1994.
The investment-grade corporate bond market now trails Treasuries in cumulative return 61.5 percent to 62.2 percent over those six years.

What happened?
Concerns about slowing economic growth raised fears of corporate credit problems, especially in the telecommunications sector.
Investors responded to those fears by selling, sending yields on junk bonds to double-digit levels and on high-grade corporate bonds to high single digits.
But it is this sell-off that has created the opportunity.
''No one wants to own bonds,'' says Kathleen C. Gaffney, a corporate bond portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Company in Boston, a signal to many that it is a good time to buy.
With average yields of 14.2 percent on junk bonds and more than 7.3 percent on investment-grade corporates, both categories are attractive, especially at a time when the stock market is putting in its worst performance in more than two decades.
But on top of this, these junk and investment-grade bonds also offer an opportunity for nice capital gains.
Their prices have been driven down in some cases to levels that assume a recession.
And if that proves to be a bad forecast, the prices should rally.
What has made this bet more attractive is the recent shift in thinking at the Federal Reserve, where policy makers have now signaled that they expect to cut interest rates soon, possibly as early as this month.
The negative economic signs may yet get worse before they get better, but the Fed's willingness to act does suggest there is a smaller chance of a recession.
The rally in both the investment-grade and junk markets since the first indication of this policy shift on Dec. 5 shows that some investors are already jumping back into the corporate sector.

''The Fed is saying that I am not going to make this worse,'' said William Cunningham, the corporate bond strategist at Chase Securities.
So even though there is probably more pain to come as the economy slows further, he said that ''it is probably time to look at selected sectors.''
These include banks and financial companies, which he said are the types of companies that usually benefit first when the Fed begins to cut rates and investors think more of rebound than recession.
As for high yield, Mr. Taylor of United States Trust suggests buying a fund because that provides the diversification necessary to mitigate the negative impact from some of the companies actually defaulting on their bonds.
In the case of Treasuries, it is hard to believe that they can repeat their performance of last year, when notes and bonds returned 13.4 percent and longer-term Treasuries, with maturities of 10 years or more, returned an average of 20.2 percent, according to Merrill Lynch indexes.
Treasuries had many things going for them: the expectation of slowing economic growth, growing government surpluses and the consequent reduction in issuance of new Treasury debt, the beginning of the actual buying back of existing Treasury debt and the expectation, confirmed by Fed policy makers at their Dec. 19 meeting, that the Fed will be cutting interest rates soon.

But, for this year, many analysts think that Treasuries have already priced in several Fed rate cuts and an economic slowdown to 2 percent or lower.
The yield on the March futures contract on the Federal funds rate has plunged almost half a percentage point, to 6 percent in the last two months, signaling that many investors expect the Fed to make two quarter-point cuts in its benchmark interest rate by the end of the first quarter.
One of the forces that accounted for much of the move in longer-term Treasuries last year will be around again this year.
That is a continued decline in the issuance of new Treasury securities and the elimination of the issuance of others as the country continues to enjoy large budget surpluses.
This decrease in supply only makes the securities more attractive, driving the yields even lower than economic fundamentals might justify.
This year the Treasury could stop selling new 30-year bonds.
One-year Treasury bills are expected to be eliminated as soon as the new Bush Treasury can get up to full gear, and the issuance of the two-year note will be cut drastically, from monthly sales to just eight times or even four times a year.
This new diminished supply of shorter-term securities should add extra downward pressure on these Treasury rates this year.
On a December afternoon, Mr. Huggins, 42, stood on the elliptical deck, looking over a magnificent panorama of the Rocky Mountains and Continental Divide.
Sometime this year, Mr. Huggins and his two sons plan to become the house's first human occupants.

Behind him, the rooms and hallways receded in a billow of soft curves, not a right angle in the bunch.
The sculptural shapes embodied Mr. Deaton's belief that architecture should reflect the rounded natural world, as well as the rounded bodies that have to live in it.
''It's hard to tell, till we've tried, what it'll be like living here,'' he said.
The history of the Sculptured House and its nearly four-decade gestation involves good luck and bad, and two very different temperaments -- round pegs -- that saw home in its charmingly rounded lines.
Mr. Huggins is a bulky 6 foot 5 and speaks with a measured earnestness that seems at odds with the house's sense of play.
In the early 1990's, he was working in public development in Denver when two of his friends conceived of a software program that would compress images for the Internet.
''My stock has gone up 20 times since the merger,'' said Mr. Huggins, who now devotes most of his energies to various philanthropies.
Even with AOL's recent difficulties, he said, ''it's virtually impossible that the stock would fall so far that it would change my standard of living.''
He began to invent, in unrestrained bursts: board games, bank vaults, lighting systems, cameras, furniture, sewing machines.
''I can reason with a cube,'' he wrote in the magazine Art in America, ''but I cannot cherish one.''
''He said: 'That's a house.
How would you like to build it?'
In Art in America, he wrote in triumph: ''In building this house, I believe I have committed an act of freedom.
I am out of the box, off the streeted grid.''
Charlee Deaton, the architect's daughter, remembers her father playing poker with Mr. Allen, one eccentric recluse locking horns with another.

''Frank Gehry has computers to work out the curved geometries,'' Mr. Antonopoulos said.
Mr. Huggins plans to make the house a weekend home, a getaway from his landmarked 1925 mansion in downtown Denver.
But he will mainly use it for charity events.
''People are very curious about the house,'' he said.
''It's a great draw.''
For his two sons, Bobby, 8, and Bill, 10, the house's biggest attraction is the elevator.
If they are too young to see it as Woody Allen did, for them, too, it conjures up pop cultural associations.
''They think it's out of 'Star Trek,' '' Mr. Huggins said.
''They want to be able to step in and say, 'Bridge,' and have the elevator take them to the living room.''
It may someday do that.
But up on Genesee Mountain, the future runs about 35 years behind schedule.

Whether it is to research car prices or actually buy a car, many women find that using the Internet is a more comfortable -- and in some cases more profitable -- alternative to braving the salesman's turf: the showroom floor.
''I think the most powerful thing a buyer can do is withhold the human element,'' wrote one visitor to the Women's Auto Corner, an online message board at Edmunds.com, a site that provides information for car shoppers.
''That's where the dealers have the edge over many of us.''
Only a handful of sites, including Greenlight.com and CarsDirect.com, work directly with car dealerships in a given area to strike an acceptable deal and guide the buyer through the transaction.
By having a representative from either of these sites handle the negotiating, buyers could conceivably avoid setting foot in a showroom except to sign the contract and take the keys.
''Greenlight and CarsDirect are trying to offer customers a new way of buying cars,'' said Babba Shetty, an analyst at Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., Internet research firm.
''They're not trying to go around the dealer, but they have a hand-holding process with customers, almost like a concierge service for new-car buying.''
Several sites, including Autobytel.com and CarPoint.com, provide referral services, handing off the shopper to a dealer for final negotiations.
Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com) offer invoice and manufacturer pricing information as well as links to other car-buying sites.
Many women say they still feel ignored, or sense other forms of discrimination, when they go to dealerships.
''I don't think the issues have changed,'' said Bonnie Rick, who oversees the Women's Auto Corner message boards at Edmunds.com.
''There are still a lot of dealers who treat people poorly based on perceptions of gender -- and also race and socioeconomic status.''
It is also generally believed that women get worse deals.
''Women tend to pay more; I don't know why,'' said Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing/Research, an auto-industry research firm in Bandon, Ore. ''They pay higher interest rates for their loans and higher prices on the cars.
It may be a case of not wanting to haggle, or not being willing to say, 'That's too much' -- not being aggressive enough.''
A recent study of car pricing in California, conducted by the Yale University School of Management and the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley, suggests that women who use online car-buying sites save money.
''In every statistical analysis we've done, we've found that women pay about a half-percent more, or about $100 more per car, than men do,'' said Fiona Scott Morgan, associate professor of economics at the Yale School of Management.
''Women who use the Internet do not pay this half-percent.''

Professor Morgan said a likely reason for the findings was that dealers tend to perceive shoppers who come through the online sites as serious buyers.
That represents 28.1 percent of all online car shoppers, up from 24.3 percent in 1999 and 19.6 percent in 1998.
Although many dealers work with the car-buying sites, some say that any consumer will get a better deal by coming to them directly.
''Most consumers will make out better by doing their own research online, then by dealing with dealers directly, because the dealers are in the position to make the best deal,'' said Andrea Carsien, vice president of Teresco Enterprises, a dealership group in Springfield, N.J. ''We have the product, the distribution and the chains.
Autobytel doesn't have cars in inventory.''
Ralph Sibbio, sales manager of the Manhattan Auto Group in New York, said a lot of dealers were trying to erase the stigmas around the treatment of women who buy cars.
It is well understood, he said, that asking a woman if her husband or boyfriend would be coming in was very ''old school.''
''The Internet is not a threat to dealers,'' Mr. Sibbio said.
''A consumer coming in educated usually is a quick sale.''
Factors like manufacturer's sales incentives are such ''moving targets,'' Mr. Spinella said, that it's difficult for the research sites to provide consistently accurate information.
''The best way to do it is to get whatever information you can online, and understand that the information may or may not be to the dollar,'' he said.
''Always assume that there is yet one more incentive out there that you don't know about or that they don't know about.
After you have all the information in hand, the best place to buy is in a showroom, not over the Internet.''
While the Internet arms both male and female shoppers with much more information than they once had access to, it has also made the buying process more confusing.
''The dealers who've been trained better to deal with different populations, in general, tend to treat women better, but the overall process has become more complex than it used to be,'' said Ms. Rick of Edmunds.
But now consumers have to think about the invoice price, rebates, incentives and holdbacks'' -- money the manufacturers pay to dealers to help cover interest expenses.
And for some women, the relief of not having to contend with sales pressure is just as important a reason to shop online as whether they actually get the lowest price.
''When I went to the dealers it almost always came down to them saying, 'What's it going to take to put you in this van today?'
''I hate being in a situation where I feel stupid and pressured.''
''I wouldn't buy a car any other way.''

Amid signs that the economy is slowing faster than expected, the Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut the federal funds and overnight lending rates at midweek.
The labor report on Friday, showing continued tightness and increasing upward wage pressure in the employment market, brought investors back to earth.
It indicated that inflationary pressures could make it difficult for the Fed to cut rates further.
The Dow Jones industrials also took a hit, ending at 10,662.01, down 1.2 percent.
With uncertainty in the equity markets, investors turned to bonds, driving down the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 4.92 percent from 5.10 percent a week earlier.

In the media industry, of course, advertising is the crucial -- and often, the only -- revenue component.
''If interest rates come down, then people can afford high-ticket items and advertisers pump up their spending,'' noted Robert Coen, the forecasting director at the advertising agency Universal McCann.

In other words, few other industries are so directly linked to public confidence in the economy -- and thus able to so quickly benefit from, or be dragged down by, changes in the public mood.
''Advertiser-driven stocks are leading indicators,'' noted Michael Kupinski, who follows media companies for the investment firm of A. G. Edwards.
''They will drop in anticipation of a recession and rise in anticipation of a recovery.''
Entertainment companies, which provide the public with affordable amusements like music, movies and TV programs, were once considered recession-proof, making them good investments in a slow economy.
No more.
As entertainment and media companies have merged, many are more dependent on advertising revenue.

Mr. Kupinski, who was warning last summer that a recession could batter media stocks, sees last week's upturn as justified.
''We feel that slower growth and lower expectations are already built into stock prices,'' he said.
''We feel that the economy will be healthy and that the comparisons will be fairly decent.''
That said, some media companies are taking steps to cut costs -- particularly at Internet operations that are not yet profitable.
For example, New York Times Digital, the Internet division of the Times Company, is laying off about 70 employees, or about 17 percent of its work force, people at the unit said over the weekend.
And last Thursday, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation said it would eliminate several hundred jobs in its Internet division, News Digital Media.
Michael J. Wolf, senior partner for media and entertainment at Booz Allen Hamilton, sees a reasonably good year ahead for media companies.
''Advertisers won't cut back as much as people say,'' he said.
''They may slow down, but they are concerned that in a slower economy they have to create demand.''

''Much of the bad news is known, but not how long it will last,'' cautioned Edward Hatch, a media analyst at SG Cowen.
''How big is the valley, and are investors willing to look over it?
I would not say that the stocks are out of the woods.
Investors need to be mindful of that.''
They should be mindful, too, that economic hopes and fears do not fully explain the recent behavior of media stocks.
''When a stock moves like that, you wonder whether it is institutions and day traders that are just trading on momentum,'' he said.
''It is true the government can lower interest rates, but changes don't happen that quickly.
You have to look out a year or so.''
To several media analysts, much of last week's media rebound was traceable to short sellers -- investors who bet that a stock's price will fall.
Whatever the fate of the economy in coming months, the question for media investors this week is whether the current prices of their stocks are justified by the fundamentals -- or whether media stocks will follow the rest of the market and give back all their gains.

''I feel like a pilot who has taken off and discovers a serious malfunction,'' said Pepe Perille, 35, who opened a restaurant last year featuring sushi and disco dancing.
The alarm ranges from the histrionic to the philosophical in this resort that is in season for a precious 10 weeks -- from the third week of December to the end of February -- and then reverts to a virtual ghost town by April.
''Rely on the Argentine economy?''
asked Ana Maria Bozzo, owner of La Posta del Cangrejo, one of Punta del Este's most fashionable hotels -- with $345-a-night pastel bungalows and photographs of former President George Bush and King Juan Carlos of Spain in the lobby.
''Better to rely on God.
Every year the big question is what is going to happen to Argentina, and you just never know.''
Punta's crisis is a product of long-term social trends as well as five years of generally mediocre economic performance in Argentina.
But now they generally take shorter vacations.
And with their overvalued pesos pegged to the strong dollar, they go increasingly to Europe, the United States and Brazil.
The construction boom here that spanned much of the 1960's, 70's and 80's, fed by capital flight from Argentina during periods of political unrest and bouts of hyperinflation, ended in the early 1990's, leaving several unsightly skeleton towers of incomplete structures and half-vacant apartment buildings.
Local business owners and political leaders, who found it unseemly to promote their resort in the past, have taken some strong measures to maintain their hold on their half-million annual visitors.
Sensitive to several critical stories in the Argentine press last year, the local government has pressed food stands on the beaches to cut their prices for ice cream and other refreshments in half, and it has broken up the monopoly franchise that one company had to clean the beaches, hoping that competition will result in cleaner boardwalks and sand dunes.

It has extended the hours discotheques can remain open to 7 a.m. and eased noise restrictions.
And after some brainstorming with business leaders seeking new marketing ideas, local officials announced that from now on topless bathing will be welcome.

Very few women are actually going topless in Punta -- no more, and maybe fewer, than in previous years when topless bathers had to be more discreet, say watchful lifeguards.
Argentine women like to wear skimpy bathing suits, but they are generally more conservative than, say, the French, Italians or Spanish.
''Now that topless is legal it's less appealing,'' said Orlando Uviroga, 21, a lifeguard at Las Terrazas de Manantiales beach.
Nevertheless, the announcement that topless bathing would be allowed brought a strong negative reaction from the Roman Catholic Church of Uruguay and, as Uruguayan businessmen eagerly hoped, a news media frenzy in Argentina.
Buenos Aires is in the middle of a heat wave, and with Congress and schools out for the summer break, television news producers have chosen to fill their shows with rather complete coverage of the topless bathing issue in Punta.
Gente, Argentina's glittery version of People magazine, featured the subject on its cover this week, with a multipage photo layout of two fashion models, Daniela Urzi and Andrea Bursten, sunning virtually au natural in Punta.
Seeing a competitive threat, in recent days Pinamar and other Argentine beech resorts have announced that they, too, welcome topless bathing.
''Topless is the talk of Punta del Este,'' said a smiling Ruben Rijo, manager of the San Marcos Hotel.
''I hope to God it helps bring back the Argentines.''
But most people just wink at the topic, knowing it is more hype than reality.
''Here we are at the nudist beach,'' he said, laughing, even though there was no one topless in sight.
''They are just covering themselves because they don't want to appear in the media.''
Luis Sader, a leading real estate executive, said, ''Topless may have modernized Punta, but we're still in a crisis.''
Even before the current crisis, Punta had gradually moved downscale, responding to the changes in social patterns.
It has tried to attract more middle-class Argentines and shifted its marketing toward Brazil, Paraguay and Chile.

Taxi stands began to replace their aging fleets of powder yellow Mercedes-Benzes with powder yellow Volkswagens.
Discos and fast-food chains proliferated, replacing much of the understated elegance of a previous era.
But many of the changes have only partly taken hold.
The Conrad, a Las Vegas-style hotel that opened four years ago with an immense and gaudy casino, has been only a modest success and has not spurred much interest among international hotel chains.
And a hoped-for surge of Brazilian tourists has not fully materialized, in part because of the devaluation of the Brazilian currency in 1999.
''Punta del Este is ending one era that lasted 60 years,'' said Ramon Isequilla Real de Azua, president of the Punta del Este Development and Tourism League.
''And what comes next we just don't know.''
If the Federal Reserve Board continues to cut interest rates, Mr. McVey said, the more diversified firms ''will outperform the retail on a sustained basis.''

Shares of Schwab fell $1.38, or 4.75 percent yesterday, to $27.56.
After that decline, the stock still trades at about 45 times forecast earnings, compared with about 18 percent for Wall Street firms.
The downgrade was the latest in a series of blows to the online brokerage sector, whose fortunes are directly linked to the ups and downs of the Nasdaq stock market.
Schwab, which is scheduled to report earnings next week, had already announced that it would have difficulty meeting expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings even after cutting executive salaries and freezing hiring.
This week, Ameritrade Holdings said that it would lay off 230 employees to adjust for a slowing in customer trading.
The cutbacks reflect a drastic change from the first quarter of 2000, when online stock trading activity soared to its highest level, testing the capacity of young companies like Ameritrade and E*Trade.
That boom collapsed along with technology stocks, especially Internet stocks, last spring and online trading has not recovered.
''The retail investor trades much less when his or her positions are underwater.''

He added, ''It is going to be very difficult for Schwab to grow earnings at the same pace it did in the past.''
That migration resulted in more trades per customer and lower costs for Schwab, allowing it to improve its profit margins while charging less for each trade.
But the migration is largely over and now Schwab must look for other sources of profit, Mr. Worthington said.
Given that, Mr. Worthington said, Schwab should trade for no more than other dominant financial services companies, like the insurer American International Group, or about 30 to 35 times earnings.
Though Mr. Worthington did not set a target price for Schwab's stock, a similar valuation would put its price at about $21 a share.
That is a significantly more bearish view than Mr. McVey has.
Mr. McVey's calculations suggest that Schwab should go no higher than $30 over the next 6 to 12 months, a rise of 8 percent.
By another measure, he concluded that the stock might not move much at all for several quarters.

Home equity loans typically provide funds at a fixed rate for a fixed period of time.
Home equity lines of credit have variable rates and can be tapped into at any time.
Either loan can be used for any number of things, including home improvements, consolidating or paying off debts, tuition or medical bills.

Equity loans soared after Congress passed the tax act of 1986, according to Keith Leggett, a senior economist for the American Bankers Association.
Thus, bridge loans are also deductible, but they are usually made for only a couple of months and home equity loans can be repaid over decades.
Overall statistics about the number of bridge loans are nonexistent, because very few banks even make the loans and because reporting the statistics would hardly be worth the bother for the lending institutions that do.
''But those loans still have a place.''
This is so even though interest rates on bridge loans are often two percentage points higher than those for conventional loans and some lenders require borrowers to pay points as a loan-origination fee.
(Each point is equal to 1 percent of the total loan.)
Worse, if the borrower cannot sell his current house, he may end up shouldering two mortgages and the bridge loan.
In that case he may have to lower the asking price sharply.
The lending company, too, could find itself at risk, and in possible legal trouble.
That is why financial counselors advise people thinking of taking out a bridge loan to instead sell their current house before buying another, even though that runs the risk of losing out on a dream house they might have an eye on.
Another safeguard would be to make the sale of one's current house contingent on finding a new house, although that too is easier said than done in a seller's market.
Most bridge loans cover 80 percent of the overall value of the property, while equity loans often go as high as 90 percent.
''But in order to get a new or bigger equity loan, you can't have your house listed for sale,'' said John Greco, the president of Darien Financial Services Inc. in Darien, Conn.

And applying for a new equity loan or a higher line of credit requires a new appraisal -- but ''you can't get a new appraisal if your house is already on the market,'' said Moshira Namoury, president of First Fidelity Mortgage Bankers in Stamford, Conn. Ms. Namoury added that if borrowers with home equity loans want to refinance their first mortgages, ''a lot of lenders won't allow them to if they've touched their home equity within the last 12 months.''
While people who already have a home equity loan can list their home for sale, Mr. Greco said, some lenders require the borrower to occupy the house for as much as six months before putting it on the market.
In addition, if the loan is closed within six months, some lenders will require the borrower to reimburse them for the expenses incurred in opening the loan.
For many borrowers, the appeal of bridge loans is that they can borrow a larger amount than would be the case if they simply took out an unsecured loan.
One reason is that the bridge loan is secured by existing property.
Another is the formula by which lenders calculate the size of the loan for which borrowers can qualify.
That calculation is based on dividing borrowers' gross monthly income into their monthly housing expenses, including principal, interest, taxes and insurance.
Almost all lenders make housing loans that most borrowers will be able to repay with no more than 33 percent of their incomes, while allowing another 5 percent of income to repay all other debt.
For a bridge loan, most lenders do not use the bridge loan itself in calculating the debt.
Instead, they require that a borrower have a signed sales contract for the existing home, or they require that the borrower pay six months' interest in advance.
But just because higher loans are available, lenders say that borrowers should apply for only as big a loan as they need.
''The bridge loan is not usually for the faint of heart,'' Mr. Greco said.
''It's usually for the more sophisticated buyer.''
Bridge loans are also appealing for borrowers who do not have a home equity loan or who have reached the maximum of their existing line of credit.
They also appeal to that handful of investors who would rather take out a short-term loan for the down payment and closing costs of a new house than sell their stocks or bonds.

Lenders justify the higher rates of bridge loans, when compared with home-equity loans, by citing a higher degree of risk.
''They are fairly risky transactions, more so than on traditional owner-occupied properties,'' said Mr. Heenan of Weichert Financial Services.
Weichert charges two points (that is, 2 percent of the total loan) and an interest rate two percentage points more for bridge loans than for more traditional loans, Mr. Heenan said, ''because if the loan is outstanding for only a week, as some of them are, we need to be compensated for taking a risk.''
Bridge loans come in an assortment of shapes and sizes, although the usual term is 30 to 60 days.
But Darien Financial Services, for example, makes them for 180 days, and borrowers need not have a existing relationship, as many other lenders require.
Others will make them for longer periods.
Weichert offers two types of bridge loans and only for terms of one year -- a first mortgage on which the borrower makes monthly payments of only the interest that accumulates between receipt of the loan and its repayment, or a loan secured by a second mortgage on the borrower's existing property.
On second mortgages, Weichert will lend up to $100,000, compared with $400,000 on a first mortgage.
The recent bullish housing market has conspired against bridge loans.

''When properties are still selling briskly, most sellers can still get a buyer pretty quickly,'' Mr. Heenan said.
''But as the economy is throttling back, that may change.''
Bridge loans were once a routine part of the corporate relocation process -- that is, employees transferred to other cities who have an urgent need for loans to tide them over while they look for a new house as they try to sell their current one.
Most of the time the employer will advance the amount the employee needs for the house, said Ms. Namoury of the First Fidelity Mortgage Bankers in Stamford.
Even when bridge loans are offered as part of a corporate relocation, lenders are wary.
''We only offer a true bridge loan to people being transferred by a Fortune 1,000 company, and we'll lend them 100 percent of the value of the home purchased,'' said Mr. Declercq of Countrywide Home Loans.
''But the company must agree in writing to buy the house after a fixed period, usually six months, or carry the payments.''
In such cases, the employee takes out a first and second mortgage to finance the full sales price of the new home, up to $500,000.
Eighty percent is financed with the first mortgage; the remainder is available as a home equity line of credit for a fixed-term second mortgage.
''This way we've protected the consumer, making sure they don't get in over their heads,'' Mr. Declercq said.
''Then when they sell their house, they'll be able to pay off the second mortgage, leaving them with the 80 percent first mortgage and without having to incur any private mortgage insurance.''
That insurance, known as P.M.I., is required on any home loan for which the borrower puts down less than 20 percent.
Bridge loans are not limited to individual homeowners.
''I do them on a small scale for friends who are builders and with whom we have a long-term relationship,'' said Nadine Malone, president of Madison Home Equities in Carle Place, on Long Island.
BY contrast, the average bridge loan provided by the American Mortgage Acceptance Company in Manhattan is $2 million -- not for single-family homes, to be sure, but primarily for the construction and mortgage financing of government-insured multifamily housing.

''Developers can go to the Federal Housing Administration and under a special program can get them to put up 90 percent of the cost of developing apartment buildings,'' said Stuart Boesky, the company's chief executive.
''But then they have to ask themselves whether they can put up the other $1 million or so, and if not they come to us for a bridge loan.''
However, he added that bridge loans generally are getting harder to find, because ''our environment is getting more risk averse.''
He added, ''People want bigger and bigger returns to take risks.''
Mr. and Mrs. DiForte may have taken a risk of a different kind by deciding to move to Easton, but you wouldn't know if from talking with them.
''The closing was painless,'' Mrs. DeForte said, before rhapsodizing about their new house with its sun room, dining room, living room, eat-in kitchen and second bathroom, spaciousness that she does not have in her other house.
Besides, Mrs. DiForte added: ''My mother takes a bus from Arden Heights to Manhattan, and it takes her two hours each day.
God forbid how long it takes when there's an accident in a tunnel or on a bridge.''
After another difficult night following a 115-81 loss to Milwaukee, he had found refuge in hard work, trying to persuade himself and his teammates that change will eventually come.
''The thing I've said about Steph is that he has to mature into a leader,'' Scott said today as the Nets practiced at Philips Arena for Monday's game against the Atlanta Hawks (14-22).
''The last two days he's been great.
Last night after the game he was real positive, telling the guys we'll just keep working.
''He has matured.
He's a lot smarter, a lot stronger than he has been in the past.
Also, he's starting to see the big picture, that it's not going to change overnight, but you got to continue to work hard every day and sooner or later.
.''
Perhaps the hardest work for Marbury, however, has been overcoming his anxiousness to make the winning come sooner -- to see a future through the bleak landscape of four straight losses, 12 in the last 14 games and a record of 11-26.

''I hate losing, and now I've been in this situation for two and a half years,'' Marbury said.
''It's frustrating, but we have to get through it.
You're 23 years old, and you've been a winner all your life and all of a sudden you're faced with losing every day.
It's hard to deal with it.
I do it.
Some people look at me as being a leader and more mature on the court.
I'm still human, and I'm still 23.''
After the Nets' 104-87 loss to Philadelphia on Tuesday, Marbury lashed out, saying that he was ''very fed up with losing'' and that ''something has to give.''
He talked to Marbury an hour and a half a few nights ago, trying to instill reason and patience.

''We had a conversation and I think we both left feeling a lot better about each other, and about our situation.
He has to stay positive and understand he's the leader of this team.
Everyone looks to him when things are going right or things are going wrong.''
'The most visual thing to me is that both of you guys get everyone involved for three quarters and can take over a game.'
The Bucks, like other teams recently, realized the obvious key in stopping in the Nets: ''Get the ball out of his hand and make somebody else on this team beats us,'' Scott said.
''That's something I also talked to the guys about.
If they're going to double him, I'm going to get a lot of open shots.''
Scott believes the Nets will eventually make those shots and has repeated his plan to Marbury.
''I knew it wouldn't change over one year, that in two or three years down the line I would have the people that I want and we would play the way I want to play,'' Scott said.
''I don't think anybody expected this.''
All Marbury expects now is for the losing to end.
''I know eventually something is going to happen,'' he said.
''I don't know what, but I know we will change as a team.
We will get on a run.
It will happen, just right now we're fighting.''
At times so quiet as to seem almost meek, Mr. O'Neill displayed a firm determination to pursue long-term strategic goals even if it meant forsaking short-term profits or breaking with industry practice.
On the flip side, this single-mindedness gave Mr. O'Neill a reputation for not suffering fools easily and for displaying a doggedness that could, at times, border on the inflexible and made it hard to build consensus.
Where other companies made profits their No.
''Paul is a very strategic thinker,'' said Judith M. Gueron, an Alcoa director.
''Greenspan.
Cheney.
Rumsfeld.
Time and again, Ford would turn to Paul and say, 'Is that right?'
He could be asked about shoe imports and Paul would know the number.''

At the time, Mr. O'Neill was a new director on the Alcoa board and president of the International Paper Company.
Mr. O'Neill was tapped to perform the alchemy of turning Alcoa aluminum into cash.
But mostly, he figured out how to make money -- not by cutting costs or the payroll, but by improving factory productivity and making worker safety his top goal.
In addition to being an altruistic goal, his push on worker safety had bottom-line benefits.

''He'd go visit investors and talk about safety.
They could care less and he's off for 20 minutes on it.
But he would say, 'I'm trying to create a cultural change.
If I can unify employees on the obvious issue of safety, I can unify them behind return on investment and assets.'
''O'Neill told them he would grow the business.
Mr. Becker said he also welcomed Mr. O'Neill's selection since ''he understands the need to manufacture things and he's not from Wall Street.''
He devised an innovative ''floating dividend'' program providing shareholders with higher dividends in years of exceptional profitability.
Once Alcoa gained financial stability, it went on a buying spree, picking up depressed former state-run aluminum makers in Hungary, Italy and Spain as well as taking over the No.
3 domestic producer, Alumax Inc., and then buying its main rival, the Reynolds Metal Company, in August 1999.
Everyone got rich under Mr. O'Neill's tenure -- including Mr. O'Neill.
He also holds options on millions of Alcoa shares that the company values at $86.3 million in government filings.
He correctly reasoned that Alcoa would do best with stable prices.

His argument to the Clinton administration was that Alcoa could bring an antidumping suit against Russia and probably win.
But, fearing protectionism, he suggested an alternative.
He reasoned that if global output shrank, prices would rise.
In the end, six nations, including Russia, signed a memorandum of understanding to cut aluminum output, and prices stabilized.
The cutbacks had the added benefit of causing many inefficient European aluminum plants to close.
In 1994, Mr. O'Neill joined with four other industrial chief executives to meet with White House officials and argue that the economy could be allowed to grow at a faster pace through lower interest rates without triggering inflation.
It is a position Mr. O'Neill repeated in his first news conference as treasury secretary-designate -- and one certain to please corporate America.
But on other questions he would face as treasury secretary, his corporate background offers few clues.
While he sharply cut Alcoa's debt, he has made no statements on the debate over tax cuts versus deficit reduction.
As an exporter he would be expected to favor a weaker dollar, but he has made no statements on this question either.
What do you get when you cross a godfather with a Federal Reserve chairman?
Someone who makes you an offer you can't understand.
Sorry; an old joke, and one that's somewhat unfair to Alan Greenspan.
Still, the Fed chairman does talk in a code that, while usually easy to decipher, bears only a distant resemblance to English.
Moreover, he has a weakness for Delphic statements, seeming to imply that he knows more than he chooses to say clearly.
So Mr. Greenspan may bear some of the blame for the current rash of conspiracy theories surrounding the Fed's recent decision to cut interest rates.
There isn't any real mystery about why the Fed acted; but those who insist that there must be more there than meets the eye have gained some undeserved credibility from the Fed's tradition of inscrutability.
The Fed has always believed in the occasional usefulness of ''slap in the face'' interventions, dramatic moves that pull investors up short.
But there are many people who won't accept the obvious explanation, who insist that the Fed acted on secret information about a looming recession or financial crisis -- so many that last week Roger Ferguson, the Fed's vice chairman, went out of his way to deny those rumors.

Why would commentators want to invent elaborate and unnecessary stories about hidden Fed knowledge?
One reason is political: ardent tax-cutters, who hope to use recession fears to stampede Congress into giving them what they want, are eager to put as much negative spin on the economy as possible.
Another reason is personal: those who were skeptical about the glories of the ''new economy'' have spent the last few years in the doghouse.
Now that some economic clouds have finally appeared, they don't want the sun to shine on their parade.

Finally, there's the CNBC effect.
Providing business news has itself become a big business.
But all-news channels, which struggle to stay interesting while covering the same material hour after hour, often find themselves emphasizing entertainment values over the usually prosaic truth.
Even the Weather Channel has fallen into the habit of hyping each storm as if it were soon to be a major motion picture.
And now that CNBC can no longer run breathless tales about the economic boom, it has started to feature equally breathless (and potentially self-fulfilling) speculations about economic crisis.
The result has been to put Mr. Greenspan himself in a no-win situation.
If he doesn't cut rates as fast as Wall Street wants, analysts fret that he has gotten behind the curve.
But if he does cut rates aggressively, rumors fly about the dark secrets that prompted his action.
So it was certainly a good idea for someone from the Fed to ask, as Mr. Ferguson did, the rhetorical question ''What does the Fed know that we don't know?''
and answer, truthfully, ''Very little, if anything.''
The real ''secret of the temple'' is that the Fed, Mr. Greenspan included, basically has no more knowledge about what is going on than any economic analyst equipped with a telephone and a modem.
What the Fed has that the rest of us don't is not knowledge but power.
Ironically, the belief that the Fed has special knowledge actually reduces the institution's power: rumors that Mr. Greenspan cut rates because he knows something we don't diminished what would otherwise have been a salutary effect on market psychology.
Still, despite all that, the Fed's move has already made a noticeable difference, stemming the rout in the Nasdaq and producing a striking recovery in the corporate bond market.
Another few shots in the arm like that and talk of recession might well evaporate.
The key thing to realize is that Alan Greenspan is just a man, no wiser or better informed than many others.
But he controls the money supply -- and that's enough.

''This is a clear preview of how they will vote on the issue of the president's guilt,'' said Cardinal Sin, his voice thick with rage.
Mr. Estrada, 63, is accused of taking more than $10 million in kickbacks from illegal gambling rackets and tobacco taxes.
To escape conviction, he needs the support of one-third of the senators plus one, or 8 votes.
Based on Tuesday's vote, Mr. Estrada would appear to have a margin of three senators.
The money is kept in accounts with false names and has been used to build houses for his mistresses, according to the prosecutors.
''It is very clear that for us to participate further would lend credibility to what appears to be a charade.''
Lawyers for Mr. Estrada contended that the bank accounts fall outside the scope of the corruption charges brought against him.
By voting not to unseal them, a majority of the senators accepted that argument.
''Let us pray that we may be spared further violence, injuries and death that have stricken our country in recent times.''
''We are not unduly alarmed about it,'' he added, ''because there is a mechanism for substitution or appointment of a new set of prosecutors.''

If Mr. Estrada's opponents are hoping for a sudden, uncontrollable surge of popular anger similar to that in 1986, it has not yet happened.
''Mr.
President, how could you have done this to us?''
The first lady married you and you have betrayed that vow and used many women.''
For now, though, the focus remains on the Congress, which is struggling to get the trial back on track.
And they warned that the public's patience with Mr. Estrada would wear out.
''But now there is a straightforward suppression of evidence.
That is why people are going back to the streets.''
The prospect of mounting disorder in Manila has revived perennial rumors of a military coup.
Mrs. Arroyo leads the opposition to Mr. Estrada and would succeed him if he were removed from office.
''I warn those plotting a civilian-military junta to take over the reins of government that the people will certainly oppose this,'' she said.
But the defense secretary, Orlando Mercado, has said the army will remain neutral in this crisis.
''No car, no house, Kamla belongs to everyone!''

In December, the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh hopped the eunuch bandwagon, electing three more.
Plans are afoot to form a national eunuchs party this month.
''Voters seem to trust us,'' Mayor Jaan said the other day, sunning herself in front of Katni's municipal building.
There seems an abundance of helpful people interested in explaining documents to a mayor who cannot read or write.
Ms. Jaan was wearing the flowing cloth of a peach-colored sari.
Her teeth were stained bright red by years of chewing betel nuts.
''We're not corrupt.''
These political victories are a curious turn for the eunuchs, who themselves occupy a curious place in the nation's culture.
In Hindi, they are called hijras, a word for people who are of neither sex.
Some have been born with incompletely formed genitals and come from families too poor to try a medical enhancement.
Some have been castrated.
Their social status has since been in decline, and regard for them is replete with superstition and paradox.
Though eunuchs are generally relegated to the fringes of society, they commonly show up at happy occasions like weddings and births to sing and dance.
Though their performances are often lewd, noisy and inept, their presence is thought to be lucky.
Though their blessings are requested, they are paid a fee to simply shut up and go away.
''It is an unhappy life, knocking on people's doors, begging for crumbs,'' said Heera Bai, the eunuch who was elected to the city council in Jabalpur, a city of 1.4 million.
She is as amiable as Kamla Jaan is gruff and is the guru to 20 hijra disciples.
''Opportunities are closed to us and most are not as educated as I am'' she said.
''We leave our families at a young age and live together because no one else would want us.''
Reviled, sniggered at and feared as obnoxious and even sorcerous, eunuchs would seem to make unlikely political heroes.
But for those who want to express contempt for the political establishment, a eunuch's fallen social rank is a mark in favor.
India, with a population of one billion, is the world's largest democracy.
The size is impressive, and so is the nation's willingness to engage in experiments for dispersing power among all the people.

But democracy is seldom practiced within the political parties themselves, where candidacies are doled out as spoils with an eye toward preserving power at the top.
Local government is unresponsive to the needs of the people.
Elected offices are often thought of as personal property for those foraging for bribes.
Municipal budgets, always small in a poor country, get squandered, with civic improvements ever outpaced by urban decay.
In Katni, a relatively thriving limestone-mining center with 250,000 residents, even the most basic of services are a chimera.
Only an hour of water is provided in the morning and another hour at night.
This city is usually a stronghold of the Congress Party.
A eunuch is a eunuch with a eunuch's reputation.
Drawing crowds was no problem for a eunuch candidate.
She can't read.
Ms. Jaan, running as an independent, won 28 of 45 wards, finishing 1,897 votes ahead.

In Mayor Jaan's first months in office, she accomplished several things: sinking new tube wells, renovating the main bus stop, fixing some drainage troughs.
''We can't control her,'' said Mr. Ahmad, the businessman.
''She's off on her own.
One day she listens to one person, then the next day somebody else.
She's entirely unpredictable.
And people are afraid to offend her because she can be abusive.''
It seems it is now her turn to snigger.
''If people don't do what you tell them, they need to be scolded,'' she said firmly.
Bureaucrats, councilmen, the bodyguard with the big rifle: they all know what the story is these days.
The eunuch has taken charge of Katni.
This week alone, the cost to the state of its energy debacle amounted to $1.7 billion in lost wages, sales and productivity, according to the estimate of Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation.
But while rolling blackouts and the immediate prospect of bankrupt utilities are uppermost in the minds of Californians, including business executives, the bigger economic concern here is what will happen in the longer term.

With no new power plants expected to start operating for at least two years and demand growing at a steady pace, today's uncertainties are unlikely to disappear any time soon.
And that, business leaders and some economists say, can only discourage growth in the world's sixth-largest economy, where the downturn in technology stocks has already slowed growth, leaving many fearing a recession is close at hand.
''If you are looking at a picture of California and seeing these people trapped in elevators, of course people will think twice'' about investing in the state, said Tom Lieser, a senior economist at the Anderson Business Forecast, part of the University of California-Los Angeles business school.
''Why would anyone want to open or expand a business right now?''
Executives are marshaling their forces across the state to send this message to lawmakers: fix the power problem or watch the buoyant California economy run aground.
And while the state's lawmakers increasingly recognize that utilities, power generators and corporate power users alike are angling for government action that favors their interests, they are loath to call any bluff, if jobs and economic vitality are at stake.
Craig R. Barrett, chief executive of the Intel Corporation, a keystone of the state's technology industries, has declared that the company will not be building more plants in California any time soon, blaming unreliable and expensive power supplies.
And in Los Angeles, where the economy is driven largely by small businesses and light manufacturing plants, economic development officials are demanding meetings with top state leaders, saying companies that want to move here have put those plans on hold.
Worse, they warn, persistently high energy prices could lead to substantial layoffs and companies leaving the state altogether.
Elaine Cullen, who recruits high technology and biomedical companies to the San Gabriel Valley, east of Los Angeles, said California's Frankenstein-like experiment with power deregulation has cooled the interest of outsiders.
Already, a food processor that her group, the San Gabriel Economic Partnership, was trying to lure has put its plans on hold, she said.
Los Angeles has endured earthquakes and riots, Ms. Cullen said, but the fact that a basic necessity like electricity is no longer guaranteed is almost too embarrassing to explain to newcomers.
And losing a transplant is not even her worst nightmare.
''I'm trying to save the businesses I've got,'' she said.
The crisis here stems from short energy supplies and a deregulation plan that puts no limits on what utilities pay for electricity but strict limits on what they can charge their customers.

The dysfunctional arrangement has left the two biggest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison, on the brink of bankruptcy, and state officials tied in knots over how to clean up the mess.
So far, the business impact has been sharpest on companies like Miller Brewing that have agreements with the utilities to reduce their power consumption during state-mandated emergencies in exchange for lower electric rates.
In the past six months, the plant has been shut down 22 times.

The costs are substantial.
Miller has laid off 200 of its 750 workers, and the company has asked others to take vacations or sit through training sessions when blackouts idle the brewery, which sits on three and a half acres.
Under its union contract, the company is required to pay the workers even if they are sent home from a shift.
The alternative is to keep the lights on and the brewery operating in defiance of its power agreement.
''We've always been this cutting-edge state,'' Mr. Franco said.
''But I don't believe California can continue to suffer this kind of loss.''
It is in no sense certain that the energy crunch will push California into recession, or even amount to anything more than a downward blip in a still powerful economic expansion.
If the state can quickly solve its midterm energy issues -- by securing electricity contracts to tide it over until the new power plants come online and encouraging power users to conserve -- the economic pain will be modest, said Mr. Lieser, the U.C.L.A.
forecaster.
As for the effects beyond the state's border, market watchers say companies far from California are already paying extra for the overnight borrowings that finance their day-to-day operations, as lenders and investors grow anxious about any company that shows signs of weakness.

Neal Soss, chief economist for Credit Suisse First Boston, said a severe crisis here, with sporadic power interruptions for 90 days or more, would shave about one-half of one percentage point from the nation's gross domestic product.
In that case, he said, the Federal Reserve Board might have to consider easing interest rates to keep the situation from growing more grave.
An immediate resolution to the state's problems is not apparent.
Today, Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, placed the State of California's debt on ''credit watch,'' warning that Sacramento does not have adequate funding -- barring rate increases -- to buy enough power to avoid blackouts.
Currently, the state has a projected budget surplus of about $5 billion, and Gov.
Gray Davis has proposed setting aside $1 billion of that sum to help the two big utilities stave off bankruptcy.
''They have some money to buy time, but beyond that they have to come up with a solution,'' said David Hitchcock, the Standard & Poor's analyst who monitors California.
Governor Davis has acknowledged that just about every knowledgeable observer -- save himself -- says the solution will include substantial increases in electric rates.
If and when those increases come, consumers and businesses both will have less to spend on everything else, sapping the economy of some degree of strength.
Even those who are part of the solution to the state's power woes are feeling the pain.
Utilities in California get 20 percent of their power from plants at schools, hospitals and factories that generate enough energy for their own needs and sell the rest, said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade group in Sacramento.
But now these power producers are not being paid.
Hal Dittmer, whose Wellhead Electric Company in Sacramento owns three small power plants, said he received a letter from Pacific Gas and Electric this week asking him to forgo payments from the utility until April 1 -- what would amount to an interest-free loan to the utility of $10 million to $15 million.
''If I have to dig into my pockets to keep this company afloat, I will,'' he said.
But if he cannot get credit to buy the natural gas that run the plants, Mr. Dittmer added, he will have no choice but to shut down, idling 42 workers.
Mr. Cotto displays his human side in his office, even featuring his beloved collection of Grateful Dead paraphernalia.
''We're the world's only two Deadhead Republicans.''

Mr. Cotto's office is linked by a window to the office of his partner, Paul Padovani.
Together, along with an associate partner, Adeline Cicale, they have 700 clients and manage $180 million which, Mr. Cotto observed in a bit of frankness, ''was $200 million before the market debacle.''
The two began their conversation by commiserating about slow business.
Then, on the other end of the line, John was obviously applying some pressure, because Mr. Cotto shifted a little in his chair before acknowledging that, yes, ''a snapshot of the last three months is not a very rosy picture,'' but adding in self-defense that, ''over the last two years we've done very well.''
Apparently John mentioned how much he had lost, because Mr. Cotto said: ''I know it seems like you've lost a lot of money, but that's because you have a lot of money.
I was just looking at your accounts and cumulatively, I think you are down 6 percent.''
Sure enough, the man's assets were down 5.54 percent, not a good performance in absolute terms, but quite good considering the havoc in the markets.

''I agree, I don't like to lose, either,'' Mr. Cotto said.
''I'm not going to sugarcoat things.
But we're in the market and the market isn't performing, so we're subjected to what's happening.''
He thought that the Federal Reserve Board would be lowering interest rates for quite some time, which is good for stocks, and that, historically, at 10 months, the bear market was reaching old age.
The next call started with Mr. Cotto telling a client that he had heard she was ''under the weather'' before confirming that Mrs. Cotto ''has had a nasal infection for 14 days and, since she's also pregnant, yes, she's very unhappy.''
''I'm not big into 'let's put the money to work and ask questions later,' '' he said.
That is, until Mr. Padovani came into his office for a victory lap of sorts.

The two took a break, remarking on Mr. Padovani's timely call and looking out the window at a metal fence.
''When the market is down, we electrify that bad boy to keep clients from getting us,'' Mr. Cotto said, making Mr. Padovani laugh.
Back at work, Mr. Cotto did some cold calling.
''Your negativity is coming through the phone and you're bringing me down, sir,'' Mr. Cotto said.
Then he went back to calling clients, frequently inquiring about their health: ''Hi, how are you?
How are the knees?''
Instead of trying to sell financial products, he made many calls ''just to let you know I'm here and I'm watching things,'' a statement that always seemed to be greeted gratefully.
He also tamped out the fires of a few small problems, reissuing a book of checks to a client, since the first one hadn't been sent to his winter home in Florida, and dealing with a missed mortgage payment.
Mr. Cotto also helped clients' accountants track down tax information, and made many calls concerning a specialty he has developed, specifically financial planning for people with disabled children (Mr. Cotto lectures locally on the subject).
In dealing with clients, he was always quick to joke and also offer his opinion on the market.
''Where's my partner?''
''He's at lunch expanding his waistline.
No, he hasn't jumped off the Tappan Zee Bridge yet because of the market.
What do I think going forward?
From my lips to God's ears, it's going to be an up year.''
Most City Council members attending last week's annual address by Speaker Peter F. Vallone seemed focused not so much on his proposals for education as on a proposal some are considering to rescind the city's term limits law to allow many members to run for re-election after completing two terms.
So far there seems to be no consensus among the Council's 51 members on the wisdom of such a measure, and the issue is showing signs of becoming a major source of contention within a legislative body that has long operated in relative harmony.
Not surprisingly, the term limits law, which was passed in a citywide referendum in 1993, has always been unpopular among most Council members.
It limits them and most city officeholders to two four-year terms, and will prevent 36 incumbents from running again this year when their terms expire on Dec. 31.
The terms of another 11 members will be up at the end of 2003.
With their departure from office less than a year away, several incumbents are trying to decide whether it would be worthwhile, legal and politically feasible to try to overturn the two-term limit only for Council members and not for the mayor, comptroller, public advocate and borough presidents.
Some, like Guillermo Linares of Manhattan, argue that the term limits law was ill-conceived and will result in the wholesale housecleaning of the city's legislative branch.
They complain that the law was the handiwork of Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir and conservative Republican who, saying he was fed up with legislative gridlock, championed the bill in 1993, spending more than $2 million on a campaign to generate voter support.
His opponents maintain that voters did not fully grasp the impact of the referendum.

''I never agreed with that referendum,'' Mr. Linares said.
But other Council members argue that it would be unwise politically for them to support a measure that could certainly be seen as benefiting themselves.
They and others suggest that it would be smarter to take the matter before the voters again, in a third referendum.
''I think the drive to undo the term limits law is correct,'' said Councilman Adolfo Carrion Jr., a Democrat from the Bronx.
''But the real issue for me is whether we should overturn term limits legislatively.
Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should do something.''
''We should take this back to the voters,'' Mr. Carrion added.
''The voters have spoken twice on this matter.
And if the term limits law is overturned without taking it to the voters, it would only feed the cynicism that some people feel about the power of their vote, especially in the environment following the presidential election in Florida.''

Two previous challenges to the law -- a 1993 court challenge by the Council and a 1996 citywide referendum -- have failed.
Mr. Lauder, a former American ambassador to Austria who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican mayoral nomination in 1989, has contended that any move by the Council to reverse the 1993 referendum would be illegal.
And he has made it clear that he will fight any such measure in court.
But others argue that the Council could legally vote to change the term limit law much as it routinely passes changes in the City Charter.
The law itself is part of the charter.
''I believe that the City Council would be within its rights to change the term limits law by way of legislation,'' said Paul A. Crotty, a former corporation counsel under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
''Just because there has been a referendum, does not mean that the law cannot be changed by the legislative process.''
Then there is the question of whether any proposal to alter the term limits law would make it to the floor of the Council.
Mr. Vallone has said he is adamantly opposed to rescinding the law, despite his fierce opposition to it in the past.
''I think term limits are a terrible idea,'' he said.
''But the people have spoken twice on this.''
While Mr. Vallone's opposition to a bill typically ensures its demise, the term limit law speaks to Council members' livelihoods.

''When members' paychecks are at stake,'' said one Democratic Council member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, ''there is no such thing as loyalty to the speaker anymore.''
They have scored at least four goals in a game 21 times already, compared with 28 times all of last season.
Including a 4-2 victory on Sunday over Minnesota, the Devils have scored at least four goals in seven of their last eight games.

''Just because you have a good defensive hockey team does not mean it can't be a good offensive hockey team as well,'' Coach Larry Robinson said today.
In his words, he does not want his Devils to get caught running around.
But he was not only talking about running around on defense.
The Devils' offense plays with a crisp style.
N.H.L.
statistics do not include a team's scoring chances in a game.
''Somebody's hot if they're shooting the puck well,'' said Alexander Mogilny, the right wing who has 18 goals in his last 18 games, ''but someone's got to get him the puck, too.''
Certainly, Mogilny has something to do with this unexpected outbreak.
But Mogilny, the team leader in scoring with 25 goals, chooses to look at his success another way.
''What can you do?''
''We have such a spread-out team.''

Even though they have 42 goals among them, the top line of Patrik Elias, Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora do not have to score for the Devils to win.
They have combined for one fewer goal than Mogilny in the Devils' last 18 games.
''When I speak of positioning, it works both ways,'' Robinson said.
''You have to be in a good defensive position to score goals.
To score is to be more alert and more conscious of the defensive positioning as well.''
Mogilny's recent success seems to be rubbing off.
Sergei Brylin, a left wing with 13 goals, has three goals in his last three games, and he thinks it is a result of playing on the same line with Mogilny.
''He gives me confidence,'' Brylin said.
''It's an easy job to play with Alex.
All you have to do is give him the puck and go to the net.
He shoots it, and it goes in.''

And then there are the ancillary effects.
Scott Gomez, who centers Brylin and Mogilny, has scored only seven goals this year.
But he has 20 assists in the Devils' last 18 games, and he fed Mogilny twice for goals on Sunday.
''Gomez is really coming in and finding him on plays,'' Brodeur said.
Finding Mogilny, Gomez said, has become part of the game plan.
That's all it takes.''
Of course, it takes more than mere confidence.
But the Devils have added an ingredient they have not always had -- some punch.
This road trip is a test, with a game in St. Louis following the Devils' first game at Reunion Arena since they won the Stanley Cup there last June.
And now the Devils know they don't have to rely on defense and goaltending alone.
''Naturally, everybody has to pick it up,'' Brodeur said.
''Now we have a couple of days before Dallas.
It should be a good setup for good hockey.''
But the raft of mildly encouraging consumer data suggests the economy has not entered a free fall.
The numbers also add weight to the argument -- still being made by a majority of economists -- that the United States is more likely than not to avoid a recession this year.
Corporate profits may decline and investment spending flatten out, but a tight labor market and falling interest rates should keep consumers flush enough to extend the decade-long expansion, these economists say.

''The economy has clearly softened,'' said J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, in a speech last week.
''For all the current media and public focus on the economy's softening, though, it is not at all clear at this point that the economy as a whole is slowing really precipitously.''
Analysts caution, however, that the January data covers a short period of time during the least busy shopping month of the year.
Even if consumer spending -- responsible for about two-thirds of the economy -- continues to recover from its late 2000 malaise, risks of a recession remain.
Corporate inventories have been building lately, suggesting that companies may need to slow their production and lay off workers in the coming months.
Many companies are slowing their investments in equipment and computers, after years of heavy spending.
But most Americans remain optimistic about the economy, even if they are no longer as giddy as they were in 1999 and 2000.
More people think the economy is getting worse than see it as improving, but 63 percent of Americans expect to be better off a year from now than they are today, according to the poll.
''I think that we are on a decline,'' said Julie DeMent, a 23-year-old student and part-time waitress, who was walking through a shopping district near Rice University in Houston last weekend.
But, she said, ''I don't think we're actually headed for a recession.''
Ms. DeMent has recently tried to save money on energy costs by sharing a ride to the community college where she is studying electrical engineering and by using her air-conditioner and heater less often.

''People are still employed; they're still making pretty good money,'' said Frank A. Ursomarso, the president of Union Park Automotive, which owns seven car dealerships in Wilmington, Del.
He can charge less because his own interest payments on unsold cars have fallen slightly, and customers' finance payments are now smaller than they were.
The widespread discounts being offered by the Big Three carmakers are also keeping sales from falling further than they did at the end of last year, said Ben Hollingsworth, the chairman of Group 1 Automotive, which owns 55 dealerships in the South and in Massachusetts.
Many buyers can choose among making no down payment, delaying monthly payments or getting a rebate of $1,000 to $3,000, he said
In fact, ''sale'' signs have popped up in stores of almost all kinds, as merchants have scrambled to unload goods that they had expected to sell during the holidays.
The discounts are helping to convince shoppers to make purchases but are unlikely to bring much good news for retailers.
''They may not make any money, but they're going to report big sales levels,'' said C. Britt Beemer, the chairman of America's Research Group, a consulting and polling firm in Charleston, S.C.
This January, for example, only about one out of every two consumers who buys a discounted item is also buying a product that is not on sale, Mr. Beemer said.
At the Target Corporation, which also owns Mervyn's and Marshall Field's, sales in stores that have been open for at least a year are up 3 percent to 4 percent this month, according to Goldman, Sachs.
Target had been expecting a gain of about 2 percent.
Still, Susan Kahn, a company spokeswoman, said, ''I wouldn't call January some outstanding month.''
If the increases in sales are mainly a reflection of the discounts, consumer spending could start to disappoint retailers as soon as Presidents' Day weekend, the next major shopping period, analysts said.
Last month, storms hit the Midwest, the South and the Northeast, delaying some shopping trips.
As a result, the 1999 data may have overstated consumers' enthusiasm, while this month's numbers exaggerate the comeback.
''It may have turned a little better,'' Michael P. Niemira, a vice president at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi who tracks retail sales, ''but it remains to be seen if it's anything to write home about.''
Correction: January 26, 2001, Friday An article in Business Day on Wednesday about a pickup in consumer spending reversed last year's and this year's statistics on the effectiveness of discounts in drawing customers to full-price merchandise.
About one of every two consumers who buys a discounted item this January is also buying a product that is not on sale; last year the ratio was one in three.
Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products N.V., the struggling maker of voice-recognition software, has reached a preliminary agreement on $60 million in rescue financing from a New York firm, according to an executive who has been briefed on the plan.
Lernout & Hauspie, based in Ieper, Belgium, will go before a bankruptcy judge in Camden, N.J., on Thursday to get permission to release funds that will allow the lender, Ableco Finance L.L.C., to conduct due diligence for the rescue package, according to the executive.
Ableco Finance specializes in making secured loans to troubled or bankrupt companies.
Ableco is an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund.
Ableco has committed itself to lend at least $20 million, which will go to repay a bridge loan from GE Capital made to Lernout & Hauspie late last year.
An additional $40 million, which would finance the company's operations, was contingent upon Ableco's review of Lernout's operations, according to the executive.
The review must be completed by Feb. 7, the executive said.

Ableco's terms include an interest rate of 11.5 percent on the financing.
The loan is in first position in the line of creditors waiting to be repaid by the ailing company.

It is also under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic after revelations of a $100 million cash shortfall in the company's South Korean unit and questionable accounting practices companywide.
Ableco makes around $950 million of loans a year, with the average financing $20 million to $60 million, according to an executive close to negotiations.
Because of its affiliation with Cerberus, which specializes in investing in distressed securities, Ableco is often willing to invest in deals that larger, traditional secured lenders, like GE Capital, might turn down, the executive said.
Greenspan Lends Support To a Substantial Tax Cut
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave his blessing to a substantial tax cut but warned that it should not be so big that it would plunge the government back into deficit if the federal budget surplus fails to materialize as projected.
Mr. Greenspan, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, also provided his first public assessment of the state of the economy since the Fed reduced interest rates on Jan. 3, saying the economy has all but stopped growing.
That led some analysts to conclude that the central bank is likely to cut rates by another half a percentage point at its meeting next week.

WHAT a January it has been for junk bonds.
And the price rise that would come with a rally would add nicely to total returns.
Analysts are not talking about a repeat of 1991.
But with the capital gains from January and just the interest on junk bonds for the remainder of the year, the return would be 17 percent, better than many of the 2001 forecasts.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Still, the junk-bond rally is not evidence that the worst is over for the economy.
Yes, the line of investors waiting to snap up junk bonds is so long that companies are rushing to raise money.
But the rate of corporate defaults on bond payments is already well above historical averages -- and climbing.
Merrill Lynch expects it to rise to 7.7 percent this year from 6 percent at the end of 2000.
And the list of companies in trouble or in bankruptcy is growing, with additions like Trans World Airlines, Converse and Bradlees.
What the junk rally has proved is how easy it is to miss the train.
In other words, you have to risk jumping on early to have a chance of being aboard when it leaves the station.

Now the rally has gone so far so fast that caution is in order for anyone hoping to catch up.
Martin S. Fridson, the chief high-yield strategist at Merrill, said last week that the junk-bond market ''still looks cheap'' for those who think that the economy will avoid a recession.
But for those who think that a recession is in the cards, the junk market has become a bit expensive.
The spread between the yields on junk bonds and on comparable Treasury securities is now 7.72 percentage points, down from 8.91 at year-end.
That change moves the junk-bond market from undervalued to fairly valued in a recessionary environment, Mr. Fridson said.
While most forecasters are predicting that a recession will be avoided this year, the word is creeping into more predictions.
The government's initial report on gross domestic product for the fourth quarter, due on Wednesday, will show if the economy has slowed even more.
The average of the forecasts collected by Bloomberg News is for an annual growth rate of 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter.
But forecasts go as low as 1.3 percent.
Federal Reserve policy makers will signal their level of worry when they meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.
And they do appear to be concerned.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said on Thursday that ''as far as we can judge, we have had a very dramatic slowing down, and indeed we are probably very close to zero at this particular moment.''
That comment increases the likelihood for a one-half-point cut in the central bank's benchmark short-term interest rate.
But if the economy needs that much of a jump start, junk bonds may look a little less attractive until the outlook for the economy is a little clearer.
Which is why we want so badly for them to stay together.
When Allen Iverson and Jerry Stackhouse cannot coexist in Philadelphia, the public outcry is minimal.

Yet, since O'Neal and Bryant have aired their grievances over, among other things, how the offense should work -- Shaq prefers the inside-outside way that won the Lakers the title last season, Kobe wants more offensive opportunities to mirror his talent or something like that -- every analyst or coach affiliated with the game either tries to play down the feud or strongly encourages the two supernovas to work things out.
It is selfish really, not about whether we want Kobe or Shaq to be happy and retire with a handful of rings.
What we really don't want is parity.
We want a dynasty -- Showtime revisited, anything resembling a parade coming to the Garden once a year.
And the feeling around the National Basketball Association is, if Shaq and Kobe are pre-empted, if they can't work it out, who can?
The league is somewhat of a culprit.
The N.B.A.
has emotionally invested itself in the notion of the two Lakers taking the baton from Michael Jordan's Bulls and carrying it for the next decade.
Whether it is a championship video or an overdramatic TNT commercial, the league prematurely fed into this whole idea that the struggle for chemistry is over now that the Lakers have won one championship, a neat little package to fit the story line.
We can't let them grow up like normal players, because who has a shot of becoming the league's next glamour team?
Sacramento?
Who knows if Chris Webber will stay.
Portland?
San Antonio?
Their players just don't connect with the public enough; there is some unexplainable void there.

If O'Neal's absence for the third time all season said anything, it's the obvious: Bryant cannot take this team back to the finals by himself.
The team is 1-2 without O'Neal.
''I don't know if he thinks he can do it by himself, but big guys are the most important guys on the team,'' said Chris Childs, the Knicks point guard.
''Shaq is so unselfish that he makes everybody else on the team better.
And I think once Kobe understands, the way they played last year, they'll start playing that way again.''

We all get along, and I think that goes a long way in having success as a team.''

Accompanying expenses from ballooning debt and other costs associated with AT&T's foray into cable, revenue from the company's consumer long-distance operations continued to decline, falling 14.7 percent, to $4.3 billion, in the quarter.
The recent entry of local phone companies into the consumer long-distance business have made the industry far more competitive than it was a few years ago.
Citing its plan to split into four operations focusing on consumer, business, broadband and wireless businesses, AT&T did not provide detailed financial guidance for the company as a whole in the year ahead, leaving some analysts confused.
Analysts have been expecting earnings excluding one-time items of 23 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
For the fourth quarter, AT&T met analysts' lowered expectations with earnings of 26 cents a share excluding charges and other one-time items.

In the fourth quarter, AT&T's revenue rose 3 percent, to $16.88 billion, meeting analysts' expectations but adding to concern about the company's debt obligations.
AT&T's debt is a source of concern for analysts who are forecasting meager revenue growth in the year ahead.
''There is no question that this is an unacceptable level,'' said Philip Olesen, an executive director of UBS Warburg who analyzes telecommunications debt.
''AT&T needs to show investors how it can remove itself from significant debt pressure.''
''Our floating-rate interest expenses should get a breather,'' Mr. Noski said.
The company expects wireless revenue to climb 30 percent to 35 percent this year, with cash flow increasing more than 60 percent.
Some of the optimism is explained by investors who view the value of AT&T's parts as higher than that of the whole company at its current share price.
''AT&T has immense structural and competitive questions that still need to be addressed,'' said Alan Harris, a portfolio manager at Munder Capital Management, an investment firm that does not own AT&T stock.

To the Editor:
As someone from a working-class family who financed her education at Yale University and Stanford Business School with a combination of scholarships, loans and jobs, I think Princeton's decision to compete for students by not requiring them to borrow money is a bad idea (news article, Jan. 28).
Education is an investment.
This is especially true for Ivy League graduates, as they have the best opportunities to get high-paying jobs.
It would be far better to offer loan payments spread over a longer time, lower interest rates or a well-designed program to forgive loans if graduates go into lower-paying lines of work like academia or public service.
Having paid my loans, and having tried to be generous in gifts to my universities, I see little justification to give the best and the brightest a free ride.

The group, the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, is known by its initials in Albanian as the U.C.P.M.B.
The crowd of prisoners at the Bondsteel Detention Facility is one result.
As many as 16 inmates live together in small, windowless wooden bungalows, each of which is surrounded by a wire mesh fence.
There is little room for exercise, and the prisoners amuse themselves by smoking, talking and playing chess.
The detainees are fed M.R.E.
's, or ''meals ready to eat,'' as the Army rations are called.
Every fourth day they get the cafeteria-style food that the American soldiers at the base receive every day.
In addition to suspected rebels, the center houses murderers and other criminals who cannot be handled by Kosovo's fledgling criminal justice system.
There is no effort to separate the insurgents from the criminals, but Albanians and Serbs are kept apart, as are minors and adults.
Richard Millett, the commander of the 530th Military Police Company, which runs the detention center.
American and British officers say they are acting under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, which authorizes the peacekeeping force to provide a safe and secure environment.

Suspected guerrillas can initially be held for 72 hours under current procedures.
Longer detentions must be approved by Lt. Gen. Carlo Cobigiosu, the Italian commander of the international peacekeeping force.
The United States Army provides a list of detainees to the Kosovo courts and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

''We are not disappearing people,'' said Capt.
Paula I. Schasberger of the command's judge advocate office.
The Army says the group was carrying weapons.
But he denies being a member of the rebel group.
''There are people here just because they have a beard and are suspected of being U.C.P.M.B.
''There is no paper that says I can go to court, and no basis for me to have a lawyer.''
Army officials insist that they would like nothing more than to turn some of their cases over to the Kosovo courts.
The problem, they say, is that local judges, almost all Albanian, have little desire to punish their fellow Albanians.

After British troops caught 13 suspected rebels crossing the boundary with a shipment of heavy machine guns and other arms on Dec. 20, the case was referred to the court in Gnjilane, an Albanian-dominated town in southeastern Kosovo.
The Gnjilane judge ordered that nine of the suspects be set free, a decision the United States has rejected.
The Army plans to turn the suspects over to the United Nations so that their case can be decided by international judges sent to Kosovo to shore up its makeshift justice.
The Army's effort to contain the rebellion has not always gone smoothly.
Given the peacekeepers' energetic effort to patrol the border, the 530th Military Police Company has contingency plans to expand the detention center.
''We are reluctant to be releasing anyone right now knowing that they may go right back across the border and pick up where the left off,'' Colonel Gross said.
''The quandary is that we are holding them based on some intelligence and perhaps not based on judicial evidence that would go forward in a court of law.
That flat-out is the truth.''
Mr. Higgins, 39, describes himself as a ''contrarian, bottom-up stock picker'' who buys value when and where he finds it, even in nontraditional value havens.
An employee of the Dreyfus Corporation and of Boston Company Asset Management, both units of Mellon Financial, Mr. Higgins also picks stocks for the $370 million Dreyfus Small Company Value fund and about $6.5 billion in institutional accounts.

Mr. Higgins and four analysts work on the MidCap Value fund, which has 100 or so stocks, mostly of United States companies with market capitalizations of $1 billion to $10 billion.
Each week, Mr. Higgins uses a computer screen to look for cheap stocks based on ratios of price to earnings, price to book, price to sales, and enterprise value to Ebitda.
(Enterprise value is total market capitalization plus debt and preferred shares, less cash and investments, while Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.)
He also runs weekly screens to look for changes in Wall Street's earnings forecasts for the current and next years, to find companies in the early stages of turnarounds.
Every quarter, he screens corporate balance sheets, looking for faster bill collection and turnover of inventories, increasing sales relative to inventory, or declining debt.
What is a cheap price for a stock?
The fund also wants stocks that are cheaper than their histories would suggest, particularly on a price-to-book basis.
''Earnings can be cyclical, but price to book is much more stable,'' Mr. Higgins said.
''And it tends to correlate reasonably well with return on equity.''

Next, he looks for catalysts that can bolster a stock price, like accelerating revenue, a corporate restructuring, an acquisition or a large share repurchase program.
Another signal is insider buying.
''In smaller companies, if you see management buying stock for their own accounts, it's often a good sign,'' he said.
Turnover is high -- 242 percent in fiscal year 2000 -- but he is not apologetic.
''The market is extraordinarily volatile now,'' he said.
''Stocks are going down very hard and very fast, and we try to take advantage of that.''
He sells shares when they meet his price targets, when a company reports disappointing earnings or when its market erodes.
He expects earnings of $1.10 a share by 2002 and a stock price of $20 by year-end; it is now at $6.88.
Another favorite is Six Flags Inc., which operates nearly 40 theme parks in the United States and Europe.
It is growing rapidly through acquisitions, he said, adding that there were 80 independently owned theme parks in this country and in Europe.
Management typically pays five to seven times cash flow, he said, to acquire companies that become far more profitable after it upgrades their operations.

Mr. Higgins also said management plans to increase spending by customers by $3 to $5 a visit and to reap profits from sponsorships with companies like Coca-Cola.
His target price is $40 over the next 6 to 12 months; the shares now trade at $20.20.
IN November, Mr. Higgins bought shares of the Cendant Corporation, which includes hotels and car rental, tax and real estate agencies.
''The company's very cheap, and it's put most of its past problems behind it,'' he said.
Falling interest rates should help its real estate and mortgage banking businesses, he added.
He figures that the company is worth $23 a share; it now trades at $13.18..

You heard Alan say that economic growth, which was over 5 percent last year, is ''very close to zero'' today.
I'd say we'll have two, maybe three quarters of actual decline.
You call it ''negative growth'' because you're afraid to use my name.
Aren't you overlooking the stimulus of Bush's $1.6 trillion retroactive tax cut?
Won't combined fiscal and monetary stimulus jack up demand, start a housing boom and make our landing so soft we'll hardly notice that times are hard?
Let me tell you about decade-long budget projections, kid.
You can project surpluses as far as the eye can see, but just a few years ago all the expert eye could see was deficits.
The one figure you'll never get out of your economists is the rate of increase of their projections of surplus, which has just exceeded the rate of decrease of economic growth.
Is that too complicated for you?

Yes.
Simply stated, all those estimates are pie in the sky.
When I get a good grip on you, tax revenues plunge and the surpluses disappear -- as well they should, to see me go.
And future Congresses change everything to fit new circumstances.
It's silly to think that any policies on spending or income redistribution decided today will stay fixed for 10 years.
Wake up from such faith-based economics and smell the reality.
You mean the whopping tax reduction won't slow you down at all?
It's a sales gimmick to stop the growth of government and the stultifying redistribution of wealth, you ninny.
The only tax cut that would actually add to the surplus is the one on capital gains.
Some $20 trillion in unrealized gains is frozen in people's portfolios; if you cut that tax rate in half, you'd encourage reinvestment and collect a bundle while helping hustle me offstage.
But that won't happen.
Have good cheer -- Recession's here.
You push up unemployment over 6 percent, bring on demands to lower the minimum wage, force families to pinch pennies -- and you call that cheery?
Except in those relatively few cases when breadwinners lose their jobs -- sorry about that -- I defend family buying power, which is already beginning to erode as oil prices stay up.

Nor can inefficient media moguls merge themselves out of earnings trouble.
I'm no rude beast slouching toward Wall Street; on the contrary, I restore sense to stock multiples and thereby prevent crash -- extremely unsoft -- landings.
How do we get back to the fun part of the business cycle?
Most people who saw their assets rise during the 90's boom figured that was the same as saving, so the country as a whole now saves nothing and inflation is not feared because it seems to have little to erode.
But the only way to save is to refrain from spending all you make.
So sock what you can in bonds or stocks that pay dividends, because that real saving provides investment capital and buying power.
How soon can we look forward to your departure?
Only when the Gloomy Guses think I'm here to stay.
At that point, nothing recedes like Recession.
The list of retailers whose stocks, bonds, or bank debt has sunk to distressed levels in the last year is long and ugly.
Depressed prices do not, of course, indicate that bankruptcy is imminent, or even that store closures will be necessary, but they do usually indicate that a company's financial position has become particularly fragile.

The indicators are everywhere.
There has been a rise in the number of companies whose bank debt is suddenly thought to be worth a lot less than it was just a few months ago.
''In the last year there has been a greater number of distressed loans in the retail sector,'' said Marc Lasry, managing director of Amroc Investments Inc., the country's largest broker-dealer of distressed debt.
A bank that owns part of a loan to Warnaco, the manufacturer of Calvin Klein jeans and underwear, for example, recently offered to sell the loan to any bidder that would pay 55 cents on the dollar.
It got no takers, according to Amroc, which facilitates private trades of bank debt.
The private market for the bank debt of Revlon has also sunk beneath 90 cents on the dollar, Amroc said.
Credits ratings are falling almost as quickly as the Nasdaq was last year.
In the past four months alone, Moody's has downgraded the debt of both Saks and ShopKo Stores from investment quality to junk.
Dillard's and J. C. Penney, are having their credit reviewed by Moody's.
If they are downgraded, both would see their credit slip from investment grade to junk.
And while stock prices for retailers as a whole have risen lately, partly on expectations that the recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will help revive consumer confidence and partly due to stronger-than-expected January sales, many retailers are suffering from sharply lower prices on Wall Street.
Among the stocks trading beneath the bargain basement price of 50 cents a share are Lechter's, the houseware chain, and Today's Man, which was delisted from Nasdaq in July.
Delia's, a retailer to teenage girls, is off its 52-week high of $13.75 a share and is trading under $5.
The company's spokesperson, Amanda Mullin, said, ''We do not believe that evaluating the company on the basis of the stock price of a single pre-merger entity is an accurate reflection of the combined entity's performance.''
There are plenty of strong retailers out there, of course.
No one thinks skilled operators like Wal-Mart Stores, Target and Gap cannot thrive in a downturn.
They may actually benefit from carnage elsewhere.
A wave of bankruptcies not only leaves less competition, but also offers an abundance of empty stores and brand name trademarks that can be snapped up for a bargain.

Yet even as the Fed is attempting to ride to the rescue, industry gatherings are rife with whispers about the weakest of the weak, about chains closing some stores in hopes of saving the rest, and of consolidations across the retailing landscape aimed at eliminating some of the excess retailing space that sprouted in the boom of the 1990's.

''I've been doing this for 14 years,'' said Stewart Cohen, a partner in the Ozer Group, a liquidation and restructuring firm based in Needham, Mass., ''and there is nothing like what we have experienced in the last 30 days in terms of the number of stores and the billions of inventory up for liquidation.''
Numerous factors are putting pressure on the industry.
First and foremost is the economy.
Consumer confidence in the nation's near-term economic health has plummeted to its lowest point since 1993, the Conference Board, a business research concern in New York, reported last week.
Retailing is always among the first to feel the effects of a consumer pullback in lower sales and profits.
Retailers are also being hurt by their own over-enthusiasm.
During the boom of the second half of the 1990's, retail companies expanded operations at a brisk, some say suicidal, pace.
Retail square footage in this coutry increased by nearly a billion square feet, or 10 percent, for the five years from 1995 to 2000, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm based in West Chester, Pa., that closely follows national and regional economic trends.
The Ames Department Store chain is an example of a merchant that has paid a price for its optimism.
It was a bold move considering that regional department stores like Ames were just beginning to face crushing competition from national competitors like Wal-Mart and Target and that Ames itself had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1990, a result of too much debt from a previous acquisition.
''Maybe projections should have been more pessimistic,'' said Rolando de Aguiar, the company's chief financial and administrative officer, ''but back then people just did not believe we could come out of a year with 6.2 percent growth and go flat.''
Ames is far from alone in paying for industry expansion.
Lenders are increasingly anxious about the mid-decade boom.
''There is no doubt that credit is tightening,'' said Andrew Moser, senior managing director at Wells Fargo Retail Finance, one of the nation's leading asset-based lenders to retailers.
''In many of the nation's top banks, the level of nonperforming loans has increased continuously.
So there is a lot of pressure internally from within these institutions or from regulators to re-evaluate loan portfolios.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Speeding the rate and severity of the credit cutback is the fact that the retail lending community has itself consolidated considerably in the last decade, leaving the fate of needy merchants primarily in the hands of fewer than a dozen major banks and other lenders known as factors.
And for the weakest retailers -- those contemplating bankruptcy -- the incentive for their lenders is to file early and get ahead of other retailers who might have fire sales that depress the value of everyone's inventories of clothing, housewares and the like.
If enough merchants have been mortally wounded, it could depress prices long into the future.
''To the extent that there is a significant number of store closings, it could create a spiral effect,'' said Robert Pressman, chief executive, of Newmark Retail Financial Advisors, a consulting firm.
''If a lot of retailers run going-out-of-business sales at once, the value of the inventory drops and it becomes a general industry problem.''
The question now is whether the weakness among some retailers can be contained.
It is possible that the cut in interest rates by the Fed will spur consumers to spend, thus slowing or stopping the cycle of bankruptcies.
But at the mall level, store closings can also hurt merchants located nearby.
''With store closings by Penney's and Ward's taking place at the same time, you are going to see gigantic empty stores in malls, all on the market at the same time,'' said Larry Gottlieb, who runs the bankruptcy department at the law firm of Kronish Lieb Weiner and Hellman in New York.
''What happens to businesses in the malls with two empty anchors?''
Another article, in today's Legal Daily, dredged up epithets from the Cultural Revolution, calling sect members ''running dogs of foreign anti-Chinese forces.''

Ever since it banned Falun Gong in July 1999 as an ''evil cult,'' the government has kept up a drumbeat of attacks, appealing for support at home and abroad against a group that had drawn millions of Chinese to meditative exercises that are said to harness cosmic forces for one's well-being.
But despite widespread arrests and harassment of members, with thousands shipped to ''re-education through labor'' camps, large numbers have continued practicing and have embarrassed the authorities with public protests.
In the last week, the campaign has shifted into overdrive.
Trying to capitalize on public shock over the attempted self-immolation by seven apparent believers on Jan. 23, which left one woman dead and four others including a 12-year-old girl severely burned, the authorities have resorted to tried Communist methods.
In a typical news report today, 18 former believers described as government workers are quoted as saying their eyes were opened to Mr. Li's perfidy by months of ''re-education,'' apparently in labor camps.
Nearly every group in the country has been required to hold meetings and issue statements against the group; newspapers have featured a university psychiatrist's conclusion that believers in Falun Gong suffer from ''delusion-like subcultural belief'' and need psychiatric help.
But many people have also been skeptical of the government contention that this meditation group -- which was banned only after it showed an alarming capacity for illegal organizing -- is such an overwhelming threat to the nation.
And now, some are distressed by the example the vitriolic campaign is setting in a country that is supposedly striving for the rule of law and more freedoms.

''The way they've used these people for ideological ends in such a crude way is really off-putting,'' said a Communist Party official.
''Every time a problem blows up, the government reaches for the same old tricks.
But it's unwise in the long run.
You go too far and people get fed up.''
An editor who is a party member said: ''They have this mentality that the only worthwhile victory is a total one, with no survivors on the enemy side.
But this isn't the civil war any more.
These days things are much more complicated, society is so complicated.''
''The propaganda leaders always want to take things too far,'' the editor continued, voicing the widely shared unhappiness with the Communist Party's powerful and conservative Propaganda Department.
The United States and other Western countries have not embraced Mr. Li's philosophy, but they have condemned the way China has bludgeoned followers who peacefully expressed their views, and the treatment of Falun Gong has emerged as a major human rights issue.
To Beijing's frustration, the American government has refused China's request to extradite Mr. Li for criminal charges as a cult leader.
The Chinese government is also worried that Falun Gong protests could mar the visit later this month of International Olympic Committee officials, who are evaluating candidate cities for the 2008 games, for which Beijing desperately wants to be the host.
The essay today in the Liberation Army Daily charged that Western questioning of the crackdown on Falun Gong is based on lies and nefarious schemes.
Because Western enemies of China ''have seen the value of exploiting Falun Gong,'' it said, ''they have proved willing to turn black to white and confuse truth and error, making wild and outlandish accusations against the Chinese government's ban on Falun Gong, done according to the law.''
''Any scum who betrays the interests of the state and people,'' the article said, referring to Li Hongzhi, ''will ultimately never escape a despicable end of disgrace and ruin and ten thousand years of infamy.''
I am speaking, of course, of the so-called Euro-style bins ($39.95 at the Heartland America Web site), the ''silent soft-touch latches'' ($199 at the traitorous Hold Everything bricks-and-mortar stores) and the impractical bullet-top bins with smudge-ready chrome finishes ($325 at the Williams-Sonoma site) that have flooded the retail housewares market.
Thanks to the Internet, I had quickly learned more than I ever could have gleaned while haranguing a Hold Everything employee.
That serendipitous access to information seemed at first to confirm the idea that the Internet is good news for consumers everywhere, especially for those who have grown resentful of how power in the marketplace has shifted from customers and toward high-volume retailers.

BigTray sold a trash can identical to mine for $114.30.
Would BigTray sell to a home shopper?
I have been shooed out of enough ''To the Trade Only'' establishments to be leery.
''We're not encouraging small orders,'' said Rich Miller, BigTray's senior director of marketing, ''but we're not restricting them, either.''

It turns out that BigTray's lenient policy is common among online wholesalers.
''The Internet has dramatically lowered transaction costs for wholesalers,'' said Michael D. Johnson, a marketing professor at the University of Michigan Business School, ''who don't have to send someone out in a car to make each sale anymore.''
But now, he added, ''users like you will come to them online at no extra cost.''
Still, a venture into the online world of wholesale vendors remains an uncertain foray.

Mr. Blair's remarks were not much of a departure from the government's earlier statements that ''early in the next Parliament,'' it would assess the benefits of euro membership to various sectors of the economy before deciding whether to call a referendum.
The government has published five vaguely defined criteria for judging whether euro membership would be advantageous.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Still, the issue is so caught up in the politics of national pride and the mistrust of Continental Europe that Mr. Blair's two-year time frame was cast in banner headlines today as a ''deadline'' or ''timetable'' for euro entry.
Mr. Blair was thought to be eager to keep the euro debate out of the election campaign, particularly since surveys suggest that Britons are becoming increasingly skeptical about the euro and even about membership in the European Union.
But the opposition party, the Conservatives, which virulently opposes consideration of joining the euro for at least five years, resolved today to thrust the issue into the campaign, taking advantage of Mr. Blair's remarks to suggest that the Labor Party would try to steamroll Britons on the issue.
''We are absolutely clear that Britain should not enter the euro, that Britain should keep the pound,'' Michael Portillo, the economics spokesman for the Conservatives, said in a radio interview.
''People will realize, I think, that the general election is the last opportunity they will have, or the last opportunity they might have, to vote to keep the pound.''

His remarks, like those of Mr. Blair, underscored the feeling among many analysts that the question of whether Britain adopts the euro will be decided more by political factors than by economic ones.
Interest rate futures contracts are already pricing in additional cuts as soon as next month, and some economists forecast that the benchmark rate will fall to 5.25 percent this year.
The British economy should grow about 2.6 percent this year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, not quite as fast as the 3 percent growth expected in the euro zone, but for the first time in years, it may outpace the United States.
The Bank of England's mandate is to keep inflation at 2.5 percent.
As usual, the bank will not explain its rate decision until later this month.
But recent figures for house prices and industrial production and data showing lower oil prices and retail sales have suggested that inflationary pressures are easing.
Motorola Plans to Eliminate 4,000 Chip-Making Jobs

With the hindsight of decades, historians and others have praised Mr. Beame for having run a scandal-free administration, for struggling valiantly with an unmanageable fiscal crisis not of his making, and for allocating the city's diminished resources fairly and humanely.
Half-built schools stood as grim reminders that public works spending was moribund.
To save on overtime, some firefighters were dispatched in dial-a-cabs to relieve comrades ending shifts.
Trying to cope, Mr. Beame retrenched.
And Gov.
Hugh L. Carey and the State Legislature, bypassing Mr. Beame, set up innovative public agencies to monitor city finances and borrow money on its behalf.
He had a passion for details, political and budgetary, and a bookkeeper's penchant for jotting little notes to himself, mostly reminders to call aides and associates.
One writer called him a vortex disguised as a smudge: energetic on the job, but the kind of man you never notice on the street.
It was 1973, a remarkable year, with the Watergate scandal developing and the war in Vietnam winding down.
As if a judgment day would never come, Mayor Wagner to some extent, and Mayor Lindsay to a much larger extent, had ignored fiscal realities and let New Yorkers believe the stylish fiction that their government could afford all that they deemed appropriate in the richest city in the world.
Making matters worse, Mr. Lindsay, to balance budgets, had resorted to a stupefying array of gimmicks: juggling books to shift state aid from one year to another, using fictitious surpluses, ''deferring'' required payments, arbitrarily raising revenue estimates, borrowing against questionable receipts.
More and more, the city was borrowing just to pay back earlier borrowings.
Taking office on Jan. 1, 1974, Mr. Beame faced a staggering $1.5 billion deficit in a $10 billion budget.
But the magnitude of the problem -- really, a growing market belief that the city was going broke and that lending it more money would be foolish -- was too great for such half measures.
In early 1975, the state's Urban Development Corporation briefly defaulted on its bonds, and the financial community shuddered with the realization that government solvency could not be taken for granted.
By spring, they were all looking the other way.Mr.
A year earlier, in behind-the-scenes maneuvering at the State Democratic Convention in Niagara Falls, Mr. Beame had been instrumental in helping Mr. Carey gain the nomination for governor, and now he was being treated like a poor relation.
Mr. Beame's power was being whittled away.
After President Ford rejected a federal bailout, inspiring the ''Drop Dead'' headline, Mr. Beame assailed him for denigrating the nation's premier city.

At the same time, Mr. Beame was praised for his crucial decision against deferring payment on city notes and trying instead to struggle back to solvency.
And he was widely credited with allocating the city's shrinking resources fairly.
But he sidestepped public affairs for the most part, leading a quiet life built around his family, card games and lunches with a circle of close friends, and occasional trips to Israel and Hollywood, Fla., with his wife, Mary.
Besides his son, Bernard, of Pleasantville, N.Y., Mr. Beame is survived by one brother, Jack, of North Miami, Fla., five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
He was always working.
During his high school years, he worked evenings in a paper factory, studying during his dinner hour.

At 15, he met Mary Ingerman over checkers at the University Settlement House on Eldridge Street.
Late Entry Into Public Life
From 1929 to 1946, he taught accounting at Richmond Hill High School in Queens.
But he all but vanished in a campaign dominated by his telegenic, erudite opponents, Mr. Lindsay, a Republican-Liberal, and William F. Buckley Jr., a Conservative.
''I'm not as glib as Mr. Lindsay, not as ready with a quick capsule answer, but what does that have to do with being mayor?''
''That's what I wanted to say.
But they wouldn't let me.''

Mr. Beame hankered for only one thing, the political life.
Welfare rolls doubled.
He made no big promises, saying his administration would be one of prudent management, not new programs.
He said he would try to hold down the budget and keep transit fares at 35 cents.
Mr. Beame, 1 of 10 contenders in a free-for-all in the spring, beat Representative Herman Badillo of the Bronx in the primary and then won the four-way general election.
''I hope to be a matchmaker in the years of my administration, wedding our people to the city, encouraging them to identify with this great metropolis that is their home,'' Mr. Beame, the 104th mayor of New York, told the crowd gathered for his inaugural under cold, gray skies at City Hall on New Year's Day, 1974.
''I want our citizens to be proud to call themselves New Yorkers.''

He loved to shake hands.
''Ah,'' said Mr. Beame's press secretary, Sidney J. Frigand, ''the photo op from hell -- the mayor congratulating Son of Sam on his arrest.''

The result is a presentation of Mr. Ayckbourn's ingenious theater game that fully exploits his joy in construction.
These are plays that emphasize the wright in playwright, and the production, directed by Mr. Falls, is meticulously wrought as well: sumptuously designed and gleefully acted to the edge of hyperbole by a large and talented cast.
The plays themselves are often hilarious and quite touching, but even if they also often sacrifice a credibly organic narrative to the exigencies of pure calculus, the complex logistical equation of these plays is so impressively laid out -- and solved -- by Mr. Ayckbourn and Mr. Falls that it might as well be the point.
The plays allow the brand-new Goodman to show off its full capabilities for the first time.
The main stage, a comfortable 856-seat proscenium house for ''House,'' was inaugurated in November, but ''Garden'' is the first show to appear in the intimate, three-tiered arena that is its second stage.
The production is also an event that, in both symbolic and concrete ways, has managed to serve the city of Chicago and, with an entirely homegrown cast and production staff, offer a trumpet flourish for the achievements of Chicago's fertile and tightly woven theater community.
For one thing, the theater itself, built with the help of substantial city funds, is the cornerstone for Chicago's new downtown, whose rejuvenation has been based on the idea of a theater district.
The new Goodman, in the middle of the city's business towers, is a commanding, central structure.
Its opening, along with renovations nearby of two once-glorious music halls -- the Oriental and Palace Theaters -- have helped lure a handful of new hotels and restaurants to the area.
These days at the newly renamed Cadillac Palace, the Broadway-bound musical ''The Producers'' is being set on its feet before sold-out houses -- alas, no critical peeking allowed -- and in fact the whole once-benighted district has taken on the aspect of a forest restoring itself after a fire, with green shoots of commercial life springing up and tourists poking their heads in like hopeful deer.
The concern that the grand new theaters downtown would steal from the audiences of the city's smaller companies has been seemingly allayed.
The League of Chicago Theaters, with 150 members, reports that ticket and subscription sales are largely up, and officials at theaters ranging from the well-known improvisatory troupe the Second City to the Victory Gardens Theater, which concentrates on new plays by local playwrights, are bullish on the downtown revival.
''I'm a firm believer in the tide raising all boats,'' said Martha Lavey, artistic director of the Steppenwolf Theater Company, the city's most prominent ensemble.
''I think what they're doing downtown is great.''
For a visiting critic, a week of theatergoing (to be discussed in a future notebook) made an ample case for the energy and talent being nurtured here.
This is a city that is particularly actor-rich, a quality that makes the Goodman's reliance on Chicago performers representative but also noteworthy.
Although Chicago shows often travel elsewhere, they are rarely cast elsewhere.
And Mr. Falls, who has a national profile -- he directed Disney's ''Aida'' and the recent Tony Award-winning revival of ''Death of a Salesman'' -- has upheld the tradition.
His embrace of the local talent pool for ''House'' and ''Garden'' is a worthy gesture toward, and on behalf of, his home community, an important reminder that Chicago is a theater center, not part of the theater fringe.

None of this would count for much, of course, if ''House'' and ''Garden'' weren't so rewarding a showcase.
That they are is a testament to Mr. Ayckbourn's mathematical cleverness and Mr. Falls's brash indulgence of it.
Among other things, the plays describe a traffic pattern worthy of O'Hare International Airport on a busy day.
The shared plot is almost too complex to recount, but it involves relationships within and among several families, most notably the Platts, on whose estate the action takes place.
Teddy Platt is a feckless philanderer, the wealthy caretaker of a family business that he has inherited from his far more talented and imaginative forebears; his wife, Trish, fed up with Teddy's infidelities, has begun simply to pretend that he isn't there.
Teddy's current paramour is his emotionally overwrought neighbor, Joanna Mace, whose husband, Giles, is Teddy's sweet-tempered best friend.
The two couples' teenage children, the self-involved Sally Platt and Jake Mace, a hopeless nice guy, are in the throes of an uneven courtship themselves.
Also present are the Platts' gardener, who is sleeping with the housekeeper, his former mistress's mother; and Barry and Lindy Love, local shopkeepers whose relationship is a horror of male control and female humiliation.

The weaknesses of all of these relationships are exposed on a day when an annual community pageant is being held in the Platt garden, and the Platts are giving a luncheon whose guests include an alcoholic French film actress and a politically connected novelist who has come to persuade Teddy to run for Parliament; he's also a pedophile.
To accommodate this circus, the designer Linda Buchanan presents ''House'' in a spectacularly high-ceilinged study, and making use of the considerable depth of the new theater stage allows Mr. Falls to present some scenes in a rear dining room where, viewed through a doorway, they are enacted with clever precision, as though framed by a movie camera.
For ''Garden,'' Ms. Buchanan has created a lush stretch of lawn, with a fitfully functioning fountain at the center, an ivy-strewn stone stairway at one end and an overgrown bush at the other, within whose leafy expanse several characters have occasion to hide.
It's a commodious rebus of a set, grand for the audience to look at and undoubtedly mazelike for the actors to negotiate behind the scenes; trying to keep track of their comings and goings is part of the pleasure.
The actors, encouraged to walk the line between effective caricature and ruinous cliché, are mostly up to the chore, and at least a few -- Donald Brearley as the sensitive Giles; Susan Hart as the efficient, willfully blind Trish; Natalie West as Lindy Love, a put-upon puppy-dog wife; and B. J. Jones as the sinisterly polished political insider -- give performances that are calibrated to perfect semicomic pitch.
These aren't great plays.
Everything in them is built, from the tortured plot to the carefully prepared slapstick set pieces to the dialogue that is often convoluted to set up a wisecrack; many of the laughs knock on the door before they come in.
And it is also a canard that each stands alone; you can see either one first, but you have to see both to calm the vexations of missing details and the surprise arrivals of new characters, and to feel all the tumblers of the playwright's combination click into place.
''House'' and ''Garden'' is really one mammoth play, and maybe not even a play so much as an extended coup de théâtre.
It is, in any case, a coup for Chicago; it's awfully hard to imagine this production anywhere else.
Correction: February 13, 2001, Tuesday A picture caption yesterday with a Critic's Notebook article about ''House'' and ''Garden,'' interlocking plays by Alan Ayckbourn at the new Goodman Theater in Chicago, misidentified the actor at the right in the top picture.
He was Donald Brearley (who plays the character Giles Mace), not B. J. Jones (who plays Gavin Ryng-Mayne).
President Bush is concerned about the state of the United States economy, and so is Alan Greenspan.
With such prominent voices expressing worry, it may seem heretical to dispute the idea that the economy is in trouble.
But before Americans get too gloomy, they should step back and examine the situation carefully.
I think they will find that while being alert is fine, panicking is ill-advised.
Announcements of job cuts at Motorola and Lucent, and most recently at DaimlerChrysler, seem an ominous sign that the mass layoffs of the early 1990's are about to return.
But today, the great American job machine stands more than ready to provide jobs to laid-off corporate workers and dot-com programmers alike.
In fact, the rest of the world could only wish it had America's problems.
Even though Europe has just seen the first quarter in years in which its economy grew substantially faster than the U.S. economy, unemployment is still more than twice as high in Europe as in the United States, and most European governments are years away from being able to squabble over how they might wish to spend a budget surplus.
What is wrong, foreigners wonder, with an American economy that is slowing from an unsustainable pace to a more reasonable rate of growth?
The United States is leading the world in transforming its economy from manufacturing to services -- the direction of increasing profits in an age of globalization and computerization.
This sort of transition will naturally generate a constant stream of layoffs as workers shift from poorly run companies or those trading on old skills to new and more efficient employers.
The current relative weakness appearing in the industrial sector reflects the same ongoing transformation.

It is very hard for outsiders to believe that the United States -- with housing starts at over 1.5 million units and an unemployment rate at little more than 4 percent -- is in trouble.
Nor have retail sales and consumption spending slipped as much as the gloomy headlines and measures of consumer confidence might imply.

There is, of course, an ongoing need for the United States to work hard for higher productivity and to aim at higher household savings and a smaller trade deficit.
But why are Americans complaining about a broader economic outcome that -- in principle -- was strongly desired just a year ago?
Then, the tight labor market and fast economic growth had analysts calling for higher interest rates to relieve the pressure on labor markets that might otherwise lead to inflation.
The answer lies less in what is actually happening than in who is telling the story.
The steady drumbeat of worry over the past few months has come almost exclusively from economists who specialize in the stock markets, especially the Nasdaq.
There is far less gloom among the American corporate economists I speak to in non-financial companies, people whose main business is to advise top managers on longer-term trends that drive decisions like whether to build new factories or buy equipment.
These economists do not often appear on television, but they are close to real-world decisions on employment, order flow and investment.
If the layoffs were really such a bad sign, it should be not just Wall Street economists, but, even more so, these others who would sound the alarms.
Viewed from outside the country, there are few signs of serious weakness in the American economy -- just clear evidence that it has come back down to earth from a period of very fast growth before there could be real damage from a permanent rise in inflation.
Because the Federal Reserve has done its job well by raising interest rates at the right time, there should be celebration, not trepidation.
Treasury securities are used regularly in the financial transactions the Fed uses to push interest rates lower, as it is doing currently in an attempt to keep a slowing economy from falling into a recession.
But with federal budget surpluses rising, the government is on its way to pay off the national debt and end the issuance of Treasury securities in the next 10 years.
And because the Treasury market is already shrinking, the Fed is looking for alternative securities it can use so its monetary policy operations will not be disruptive.
Mr. Greenspan also said that the benefits of eliminating the nation's debt -- and, in turn, the Treasury bond market -- are so great that the move is worth the impact it will have on Wall Street's bond business and the Fed.
Mr. Greenspan said that there was no doubt that other things being equal, ''it would be better to have a large Treasury debt outstanding so that those of us who deal in the financial markets have easy benchmarks and easy means of pricing and of funding,'' he said in answer to a question as he testified before the Senate Banking Committee.

But, he added, ''the trade-off very clearly says by far the most important thing is to get the debt down, and we will handle the problems as best we can.''
The changes the Fed has approved, and the ones it is now considering, will expand the kinds of securities that primary dealers -- banks and broker-dealers -- can use as collateral in dealing with the Fed as the central bank seeks to move its benchmark short-term interest rate.
When the Fed wants to lower its benchmark rate -- the Federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks -- it must add cash, or what Wall Street calls liquidity, to the financial system.
It does this through temporary repurchase agreements with these primary dealers.
In exchange for securities from the primary dealer, which are taken as collateral, the Fed credits their accounts with cash.
This adds reserves to the banking system, bringing down interest rates.
In the past, these securities were limited to Treasuries and certain agency securities, including those from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
But as the supply of Treasuries shrinks, using them for monetary policy operations could limit the Fed's freedom to act and could create distortions in financial markets.

Mr. Greenspan also said that the Fed was now considering including certain state debt and the debt of foreign governments as accepted collateral for primary dealers.
But he said the Fed would consult with Congress before adding these securities to the list.
''Because the market for Treasury securities is going to become much less deep and liquid if outstanding supplies shrink as projected, we will have to turn to acceptable substitutes,'' the Fed chairman said in his prepared testimony.

Longer term, Mr. Greenspan said that the Fed was considering changes in the use of its discount window, which can make loans to banks.
But banks rarely come to the discount window because of the stigma attached to going to the Fed as the lender of last resort.
Mr. Greenspan did not give any details, but it is possible that the Fed could seek changes that would make it easier to use the discount window to add cash to the financial system to help bring down interest rates.
The central bank is also studying, the chairman said, changes in law that would broaden the list of assets the Fed could acquire, again a response to the shrinking of the Treasury market.
''In summary, although a reduced availability of Treasury securities will require adjustments in the particular form of our open market operations, there is no reason to believe that we will be unable to implement policy as required.''

Last night, St. John's appeared content to wait for Cook to work his magic, and paid dearly.
Too often, with the shot clock running out, Cook misfired on 25-foot jumpers.
After trailing most of the first half with a man-to-man defense, Providence used a zone almost exclusively after halftime and held St. John's to 22.9 percent shooting, including 1 for 13 from 3-point range.

''I was trying to, but I was turning the ball over and trying to do too much,'' Jessie said.

''There's certain guys that probably are waiting for him to do or perform superhuman feats like he did last Saturday,'' St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said.
''I'm glad that he can.''
Jarvis admired Cook for being a point guard first and running the offense, and even suggested that Cook should have been more selfish.
''That's when usually you need someone other than Omar to get it done, whether it's inside taking the ball to the basket or whether it's outside shooting.

With Marcus Camby's 14 rebounds accounting for nearly half of their total, the Knicks were outrebounded, 45-29.
Coach Jeff Van Gundy went even further, saying his club is playing like a first-round playoff loser.
''I know what a playoff team looks like,'' said Van Gundy, whose team has given up an average of 99.8 points over the past six games and has been outrebounded by 29 in its last two games.
''A playoff team that has a chance defends and rebounds.
We have lost focus on what it takes for us to win.
''It starts with defense and rebounding.
I am not saying you can't win not doing those things because we won tonight not doing those things.
You can win a game.
I have been around here long enough to know what it takes to win in the playoffs.
Those two things are paramount in the playoffs.''
With the Nets, who never led, appearing unprepared on defense, rebounding and defense were not necessary last night.

It was fitting that the decisive play involved the embattled Van Horn.
Struggling mightily over the last two weeks, Van Horn finished with 2 points and 5 fouls in 18 minutes.
''There's no way we should be giving up a hundred and something points.
We have been giving up over 100 points in the last couple of games.
Our defense has to step up.''
The Knicks had gone 60 games without scoring at least 110 points.
With the trade deadline six days away, the Knicks are shopping CHRIS CHILDS and LUC LONGLEY.
They offered Childs to the Golden State Warriors for MOOKIE BLAYLOCK, according to a Western Conference official.
The Warriors have no interest in Childs, however, and a deal for Blaylock appears unlikely.

The necessity of conducting an unambiguous recount became clear in the last election.
Electronic systems alone do not provide that.
A touch-screen system that immediately printed a hard copy of the voter's choice that could be fed into an optical scanner (or hand-counted) would provide an instant check that could be stored for later use if necessary.

Analysts and diplomats were uncertain whether the statement would be enough to restore calm.
But they said the market turmoil had more to do with collapsing confidence in the government than with the underlying soundness of Turkey's economy.
''This is a political crisis, and it will take a political solution,'' a European diplomat said.
Just what form that solution might take is unclear.
Mr. Ecevit's coalition government has withstood several other crises in recent months, but he has lost public backing, and some commentators speculated that this crisis would spur demands for a change at the top.
''The government looks very shaky,'' Mehmet Ali Birand, a commentator on CNN-Turk, told Reuters.
''It's difficult to find a new government, but a revision would be in order.''
The new problems come just three months after Turkey required an emergency loan of $7.5 billion from the I.M.F.

January was a record month for mutual fund flows, according to new reports from Lipper Inc. and Strategic Insight, two concerns that track the industry.
Net inflows were $140 billion last month, far ahead of the record net inflow of $86.8 billion in January 1999, according to Lipper's report.
But over the last year, investors have changed their minds about what kind of funds they choose.
In technology funds, for example, the volatile sector that once could do no wrong took in just $100 million last month, down from $9.4 billion a year earlier.
Much of that was a result of institutions shifting strategies and putting money into money market funds temporarily after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates.

Mr. Greenspan generally tries to steer the economy free of politics, though he has thrown his weight behind tax cuts.
But Mr. Bush, knowing full well that the interplay between the economy and politics could help decide the fate of his tax plan, has other ideas.

Among economists, the question is whether this slowdown is merely a short, sharp period of readjustment to a more sedate pace of growth and a less frothy stock market, or whether it is the first step in the long, painful deflation of a bubble economy.
On that score, Mr. Greenspan is the head cheerleader for the more optimistic school.
From his perspective, the United States is enduring a serious but transitory ''inventory adjustment.''
That is when car dealers have too many S.U.V.
's on the lot or the plastics factory decides to hold off on its plan to double capacity.
Most important, in the view of the Fed chairman and other optimists, the economy will continue to benefit from the huge sums businesses have spent on technology in a continuing drive to become more efficient.
''The prospects for sustaining strong advances in productivity in the years ahead remain favorable,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
The pessimists think Mr. Greenspan's faith is misplaced.
They see the collapse of technology stocks leading to cutbacks in investments by business in new technology -- and forcing retrenchment among consumers who expected stock market gains to pay for the nice vacation or the new BMW.
If that happens, productivity gains and economic growth will remain sluggish for the foreseeable future.
''We believe the U.S. is now in the grip of a recession.''
This debate will remain unresolved for months, if not longer.
Meanwhile, the lack of certainty is itself a potential obstacle to recovery, some analysts say.
''You've got confidence eroding daily because of the media treatment of the scary forecasts, and that's not a good thing,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer for Wells Capital Management, an investment firm.
''Then you've got a Fed that says there's no need to panic.
So you've got a confidence meltdown and policy officials who are reluctant to address it.''
A similar standoff is setting in among politicians.
With Mr. Bush suggesting that a vote against his tax cut could be a vote for higher unemployment, members of both parties are trying to assess just how bad the economy is.
Some of them, as well as outside analysts, wonder if Mr. Bush is making it worse by accentuating the negative when consumer confidence is crumbling.
''By continuing to play that up now to get a tax cut, they are potentially making the reality of the economic situation worse than it would otherwise be,'' Mr. Paulsen said.
All else being equal, tax cuts tend to give the economy a boost by putting more money into the hands of consumers.
But history suggests that the cuts take so long to enact that any recession will have come and gone before any money flows back to taxpayers.
And in the case of Mr. Bush's plan, a vast majority of the tax reduction would not take effect for years anyway.
NOT only has the president been criticized for compounding the drop in consumer confidence by emphasizing the negative, but he is exposing himself to a political risk.
What if Mr. Greenspan is right and the economy is clearly recovering by summer, when Congress is expected to vote on the tax bill?
In that case, Mr. Bush may lose support from moderates in both parties.

''There's always a temptation in advancing a policy initiative to grab any argument that's available,'' said Daniel Tarullo, a former economic adviser in the Clinton White House who is now a professor at Georgetown Law School.

Mr. Bush's speech on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, while technically billed only as a ''budget message,'' will look, feel and sound like a State of the Union address.
It is certainly being written that way.
And no sooner will it be over, Mr. Bush's aides fear, than the story will turn to one of haggling over real numbers, over the sensitive question of who benefits from the Bush tax cut and over Mr. Bush's assertions that Americans can have it all -- tax cuts, deficit reduction and even new spending.
''There is more than enough room for the tax cut of the size the president's proposed,'' Mitch Daniels, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said today as he made his way from televised talk show to talk show, offering glimpses of the budget numbers Mr. Bush will begin to specify this week.
He added that Mr. Bush's $1.6 trillion tax cut plan over 10 years would allow the government to ''pay down all the debt that is available to be paid down.''
That is a new formulation the Bush administration is using now that it has discovered, to its joy, that upwards of $800 billion of $3.4 trillion in debt held by the public cannot be redeemed in the next decade because it is held in savings bonds or treasury bills that do not come due any time soon, or are held by foreign governments.
Mr. Bush has many tasks on Tuesday night.
He must make the case for the tax cut, overcoming Democratic arguments that it is too big, too skewed toward the rich and too dependent on budget surpluses that may fade away as the economy slows.
He must satisfy the right wing of his party, which has always pressed for smaller government, while defending increases for the Education Department, which a few years ago Republicans wanted to wipe out.

In fact, its perks may be curbed: While the White House has said little about what will be cut in the president's budget, Mr. Daniels and other officials suggested today that loans, guarantees and credit insurance provided by the Export-Import Bank of the United States might be a tempting target.
Such a cut would bring howls of protest from some of America's largest corporations.
They obtain the loans and guarantees when selling products abroad.
Boeing, for example, routinely uses the government-sponsored bank to finance aircraft purchases by foreign airlines.

But in speeches like this, style always leaves a more lingering impression than statistics.
And while the White House is discouraging any comparisons, lurking behind Mr. Bush will be that cardboard cutout of Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Bush, who does not relish speeches in formal settings, has something of the same task at hand.
Some of his aides worry that he still does not seem to fill the room when he speaks, and, more specifically, that he seems to have a hard time making the case for his tax cut.
He has made some progress, they insist when speaking on background to reporters, by arguing that the economic slowdown will last if the Federal Reserve's moves to lower interest rates are not matched by a $1.6 trillion tax cut, a figure he declared last week was ''just right.''
And while Mr. Clinton's reputation and legacy have been tarnished in recent weeks, it is not yet clear that Americans are willing to abandon his economic strategy.
Mr. Bush's advisers, however, think the best strategy is to get on with the Bush plan with as little protracted argument as possible.
''We know we are going to cut taxes, so why wait?''
''Once we've decided what we are going to do, what's the advantage of spending a lot of time doing it?''
Sir John Bond, HSBC's chairman, warned that ''the outlook for 2001 is challenging.''

Mr. Ellerton plans to trim his profit forecast for 2001 up to 10 percent given the storm clouds and the lack of lift in the equity markets.
Though HSBC mainly focuses on selling asset-management and other products to wealthy individuals and gets more than two-thirds of its operating profit that way, it is not immune from the vagaries of the capital markets.
Soft patches appeared in demand for loans, especially in Asia, which has come back more slowly than hoped from the economic meltdowns of the late 90's.
In Hong Kong, where HSBC earns 29 percent of its interest income, loan demand grew just 7 percent last year.
Most of HSBC's recent growth, though, has come from acquisitions.
It has spent $20 billion since 1999 to buy Crédit Commercial de France and Republic New York, which together added $1.73 billion in net interest income in 2000.
Sooner or later, analysts say, HSBC needs to show that it can deliver growth from existing operations.
The visit by the special envoy, Adm. William J. Fallon, was the latest in an extraordinary series of apologies by the United States, which has included telephone calls from Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to Japanese leaders.
Despite those efforts, some Japanese, from relatives of those lost in the Feb. 9 disaster to editorial writers, have continued to voice dissatisfaction with the American response and have demanded that the sunken ship, the Ehime Maru, be raised to recover the bodies.
''I know my words cannot express the profound sorrow and regret that the American people feel over this tragic event.''

Later, the admiral met with Prime Minister Mori for about 30 minutes and personally handed the Japanese leader a letter of apology from President Bush.
According to news reports, Mr. Mori replied saying, ''It is important that the two countries continue to make efforts in the U.S.-Japan alliance.''

So far, the reaction of the families to the American apologies has been mostly negative, with relatives insisting that the commander of the nuclear submarine travel to Japan to apologize directly and in person.
The accident has fed criticisms of the United States military presence in Japan, where 47,000 American troops are based under the terms of a security treaty.
Most of the Americans are stationed in the southern island province of Okinawa, and a spate of incidents there, including rapes and arson, has turned public sentiment against the United States bases there.
This week the governor of Okinawa formally requested that the Japanese government negotiate a reduction in the number of American troops there.
On Monday, lawyers for Cmdr.
Scott D. Waddle, the submarine's commander at the time of the accident, released a letter from him apologizing for the first time.
Commander Waddle is the subject of a special Navy court of inquiry over the accident.
Visitors to San Francisco may not be surprised to run into otters or seals, but they may be startled if a flock of parrots swoops by.
A site about the parrots of Telegraph Hill explains how they got there (www
.wildparrots.com).
The site offers a look at their history, as well as photographs.
The flock was formed in 1989 from a single pair of cherry-headed conures who have been named Victor and Inez by Mark Bittner, who fed and cared for the birds from his terrace for several years and is writing a book about the flock.
The parrots, which are endangered, are originally from the dry, hot coastal forests of Peru and Ecuador.
They have adapted well to cool, wet San Francisco; 60 parrots are descended from Victor and Inez and other adults in the flock, and a budgie has joined the group.
Friends of the parrots have contributed details on sightings and photos to the site, and there is a link to pages about parakeets in the Dolores Street flock.

The relentless decline in share prices in recent days is an embarrassing blow to the governor of the bank, Masaru Hayami, who declared in August that the Japanese economy was healthy enough to withstand higher interest rates.
Over a storm of objections from political leaders, the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, then raised its overnight call rate, the interest banks charge each other, to 0.25 percent from near zero.
Now, Mr. Hayami finds himself having to unwind the policy: yesterday's move lowered the call rate to 0.15 percent, after the largely symbolic discount rate, the interest the central bank charges for its loans to banks, was trimmed on Feb. 9.
Electronics stocks were among the hardest hit today, in part because of the continuing weakness in Nasdaq trading in the United States.

Instead of ''doling out policy in such a piecemeal fashion,'' in Mr. Takao's phrase, he and other analysts said the bank needed to regain the confidence of the markets by setting aside questions of pride and face-saving and wholeheartedly moving to ease monetary policy, by cutting the overnight call rate to zero and other measures.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, urged Congress today to be cautious in parceling out tax cuts and spending increases, warning that the projected federal budget surplus should not be considered money in the bank.
While restating his support for a substantial tax cut and acknowledging the likelihood that huge surpluses will come flooding into the government over the next decade, Mr. Greenspan noted that economists still could not fully explain the surge in tax receipts in recent years or the degree to which a falling stock market might darken the outlook.
''What if, for example, the forces driving the surge in tax revenues in recent years begin to dissipate or reverse in ways that we do not now foresee?''
''Indeed, we still do not have a full understanding of the exceptional strength in individual income tax receipts during the latter years of the 1990's.''
He said that without a tax cut the surplus might be so big that it would force the government to begin buying stocks and bonds on Wall Street in as little as five years, a development he said would be harmful to the free enterprise system.

He again raised the idea of tying any tax cut to steady progress in reducing the debt, suggesting that the tax cuts could be phased in to take effect as the debt fell to certain levels.
Some members of both parties have supported such an approach as a compromise that might help Mr. Bush win approval for his tax cut, but the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress have rejected the idea.
Mr. Greenspan's appearance came as Congress prepared to begin writing its own budget plan for next year, amid growing divisions among Republicans about whether the increase in general government spending can be held to the 4 percent proposed this week by Mr. Bush.

Mr. Bush's budget would provide increased spending for education, the military and medical research, but would require cutbacks in most of the biggest cabinet departments to keep the spending increase to the White House's 4 percent target.
Frustrated that spending might increase faster than Mr. Bush has proposed, conservative Republicans said they would battle to hold the line, even if it meant a showdown between the House and the Senate over the budget.
''That's caused some consternation, because in Washington the definition of a cut is that you haven't increased the budget as much as anticipated,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Mr. Greenspan's support for a tax cut and his warnings about runaway spending have given Republicans a lift as they seek to push Mr. Bush's plan.
But Democrats have seized on the Fed chairman's admonitions not to spend the surplus too soon to suggest that the president's tax plan needs to be scaled back.
Ask people what started the whole thing and you get a handful of different complaints and theories.

Mr. Moshman, an attorney, contended that since his opponents could not win at the polls, they were trying for another chance through a recall petition.
''He represents the ward where the most massive development is scheduled to take place,'' Mr. Friedland said.
''He should be up there yelling and screaming.''
Bernie Stapleton, another leader of the recall drive, said, ''There are people in this town who are very upset over how things have been going for a long time,'' adding that move was an effort to bring a sweeping change to the old ways.
''If you talk to 10 or 12 people who worked on the recall you will find that each has a different issue that makes them work.''
For instance, there are proposed housing developments that residents think will transform the town into another choked suburb.
And there is controversy over a new apartment building for the elderly.
Opponents claim the town allowed a developer to build the apartments too close to an airport runway, although the town attorney says no one knows that for sure and in any event the matter is still under investigation.
Or there was the disclosure that the town was snowplowing parking lots for some churches and not others.

''Sometimes you have to smack people across the face to get their attention,'' he said.
''I said, 'You're on.'

The group began circulating petitions to recall three council members: Mayor Harkey, Mr. Moshman and Philip Weisbecker.
State law requires the signatures from a quarter of a district's registered voters to place a recall question on the ballot.
In Mayor Harkey's case, the effort died out fairly quickly when organizers could not muster enough signatures.
Mr. Moshman contends the petitions against him are invalid.
And opponents of Mr. Wiesbecker say the clerk is wrong and that they want their petitions reinstated.
The state Superior Court will have to untangle the case quickly, or the issue will be moot since the recall question must be submitted by March 15 to appear on the ballot in time for town elections in May.
But the law ''is most often used as a political weapon.''
Kevin Byrnes, who has been town clerk for 23 years and who has felt some of the heat, said politics in West Milford were not usually so divisive.
Yet he now finds himself being accused of dragging his feet reviewing the petitions.
''But in the last few years things have gotten feisty.''
But the annual two-week rodeo is a throwback, an event that begins with the arrival on horseback of the trail riders, features a full menu of bull riding and roping competitions, then culminates with the auction of chickens, turkeys, pigs, lambs and, most prestigious, steer.

Usually, livestock are sold in rural auction houses to ranchers, and farmers try to pay the lowest price for the best animal.
Here, no such logic applies.
Because the bulk of the money goes to college scholarships for needy children, bidders are encouraged to spend liberally.
Because public display of money is really not frowned upon in Houston, encouragement is usually not needed.
(''Praise the lard: Top barrow hogs a record,'' saluted The Houston Chronicle.)
The seats on the floor are reserved for the big spenders, and the steer auction attracted the biggest spenders of all.

''Now we have these animals and we all meet at the barn,'' Mrs. Hayes said.
''Just taking care of him,'' Zane said.
Unlike at the auction, this crowd was mostly ranchers and farmers wearing jeans and peering at each animal the way a jeweler might inspect a diamond.
The contestants showing the cattle must be in high school or younger.
And winning could be painful since rodeo rules dictate that all cattle earning a ribbon must be sold and slaughtered.

''It's a pretty sad deal,'' said Jana Gilmore, a spectator, noting the tears on the final day.
''You look at the little bitty ones out here who are 9 or 10.
They get attached.''
Her husband, Mike Gilmore, who makes his living trimming the hooves of show cattle, said the prestige of winning, not to mention the money, is so great that some families bend the rules.
He said that steroids are used to improve a steer's muscle tone and that there are even veterinarians who perform the equivalent of a tummy tuck.
Rodeo officials now require a drug test for all winning steers, which Shorty passed with flying colors.
The figure kept rising -- $400,000, then $450,000, then a half-million dollars.
Sold.
A record.
Zane will get $60,000, which will pay for his college education several years from now.
Perhaps that is why Mr. McIngvale later said he would have been willing to spend up to $1 million.
After all, $600,000 makes for an expensive steer, but it is pretty reasonable for a television commercial.

As is often the case, as technology stocks gained, drug and food stocks retreated.
Investors had built up defensive positions in those stocks recently, in hopes that they would perform consistently in an economic downturn.
A slightly reduced estimate of worker productivity and a report showing a decline in factory orders , added to the gloomy economic forecast yesterday.
Economists and market analysts expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again soon in an effort to revive the economy, although until last week many thought the Fed would act ahead of its regular policy-setting meeting on March 20.
''The Fed hasn't cut rates yet because they're not panicked,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst for Jefferies & Company.
The long-term view is the Fed is seeing stuff we're not seeing.''

While Manhattan's housing market ''appears to be retreating from the extraordinary levels seen through most of last year,'' commercial real estate construction and leasing in the region and residential real estate construction and sales outside the city are still robust.

I've heard that the argument is based on process and not on substance.
Well, we need to look at substance.
I know that many of you really want to be for tax relief but for political reasons you're now opposed to it.
Tax relief goes to the heart of what this country's all about.
There's three things that you can do with a surplus.
Some of it we need to spend.
We're going to spend some money on education and defense and the things, the needs of our people across this country.
We're going to take some of that money and, as of Sept. 30 of this year, we'll pay down $600 billion in public debt.
We need to do that.
But we need to take a fraction of that surplus and we need to give it back to the American people so that they have it in their pocket.
So that they can make decisions how they're going to spend that money for their families and their future and education and the needs of their debt, their credit card debt.
You know, I don't think we ought to let politics get in the way of taking care of the needs for the American people.
I remember in 1996 standing in this chamber.
It's our money.''

But I'll tell you something, that gentleman was right.
It is their money.
It is the money of the American taxpayers.
Mr. Gephardt
I think that it's wrong to be taking up a tax bill without a budget, in fact, without even spending a moment deciding what the budget will say.
By assigning nine hundred and some odd billion dollars to a tax cut that this bill encompasses, we're making decisions that will make it difficult or different, at least, to make other decisions that we might want to make in the budget.
How much debt we're going to pay down, how much we're going to assign to defense or education or health care or all the other functions that are in the budget.
So the cart is in front of the horse and we should be waiting for this tax bill until we have considered the budget.
A second reason that I urge you to look at the Democratic alternative is because the forecast that, or the premise of the context for this tax cut bill so often are wrong.
In fact C.B.O.
recently said that they're always wrong.
Now sometimes they're better than we thought they were going to be; sometimes they're worse.
You know the other day the weather forecasters said we were going to have a big snow storm in the Northeast.
We are taking an action today, if we vote for this bill, that really leaves us less alternatives in case the forecasts are wrong.
Why would we want to do that?
The third argument I'd make is that the thing we've got to keep most on our mind is what action can we take that will best help the economy, that will make the economy go forward.
And he said ''Why are you doing this big tax cut?''
And I used a lot of the arguments that my friends on the other side of the aisle make and that I believe and we all believe.
And that is, we have a big surplus.
And we ought to give taxpayer money back to taxpayers.
That's the right thing to do.
That will help the economy.
He said, ''Yes, a tax cut of a reasonable size will be helpful to people.''
But he said, ''Remember the most helpful thing to all of us is keeping the economy working.''
And then he said, think about this.
He said 1 percent off interest rates would pick up for an average family of four about $1,500 a year savings in car payments and house payments.
And if you add that to a reasonable tax cut, of, he said, maybe $800 a year, you're going to wind up putting more money in those people's pockets than by the larger tax cut that would probably keep interest rates up.
We have to keep in our mind that the goal here is to keep the economy moving, to keep unemployment down, to keep growth up.
And one of the best ways to do that is to keep interest rates down.
And so I argue to you today: Think about what this does to the economy and to ordinary families in this country who pay interest rates every month.
Another reason that I think we need to reconsider this tax cut and to go for the smaller alternative is because it allows us to take care of other alternatives in the budget.
The president has talked very dramatically about what he wants to do in education.
Query: Will we have the funds to do what he wants to do, what we want to do in education?
Will we be able to take care of Medicare and Social Security?
The budget the president sent that encompasses the tax bill, part of which is on the floor today, invades the Medicare trust fund.
The lockbox has already been picked if we vote for this kind of a tax bill.

Blue-chip stocks bucked a downward trend last week as investors and Wall Street analysts turned optimistic, predicting that the worst market slide in years might be nearing an end.
Intel also said that it would eliminate some jobs.

And with growth slowing in the United States and elsewhere, many experts fear that another slump in Japan, the second-largest economy on the globe, spells big trouble for the rest of the world.
Over the weekend, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori met with senior members of his party to signal his intention to step down next month, and Japan's leaders are now preoccupied with their inability to find a new prime minister.
The human costs of deflation are meanwhile becoming more visible.
When Hitoshi Matsushita started pondering his impending retirement seven years ago, his first concern was putting a roof over his head.
''I thought buying a place would be convenient for my future.''
But real estate prices have continued to fall, leaving the home now worth at most 40 million yen -- and Mr. Matsushita still owes the bank 30 million yen.
''I can only work until I'm 70, and at that point, I guess my life will crash,'' said Mr. Matsushita, who is now 66.
''Right now, I'm desperate.''
Paradoxically, deflation was welcomed not so long ago in a country where prices are so much higher than anywhere else.
Many still see it as a force for accelerating economic modernization.
One result is a heated debate over whether deflation is good.
Examples of falling prices and greater competition abound.
Consumers are all but stampeding to Starbucks outlets here, where a tall caffe latte sells for 320 yen, a bargain compared with prices at the dying kissaten, traditional Japanese coffee shops infamous for selling thimble-size cups of coffee for more than twice that amount.

Then there is Uniqlo, a chain of Gap-like apparel stores that is perhaps the most popular store in Japan at the moment.
Importing most of its products from China, Uniqlo is putting enormous pressure on its competitors here.
''I have a Bally's leather briefcase, a Burberry's leather briefcase and a Coach doctor's bag, but I switched to a nylon brief case from Uniqlo because it is much easier to use, very functional, and most of all, it was only 2,900 yen,'' said Koki Konishi, an executive at a car company, who also buys boxer shorts there at two for 900 yen, or $7.63, and T-shirts, three for 1,000 yen ($8.47).
Given Japan's aging population, stable or even slightly declining prices are seen by many as desirable because they preserve the value of the savings of the elderly.
Deposits held in postal savings accounts nominally earn a scant 0.11 percent a year, but deflation has lifted the real return by almost 2 percentage points over two years.

''The older a society is, the more anti-inflation it is because higher savings balances are hurt by inflation,'' said Vincent J. Truglia, co-head of the sovereign risk unit group at Moody's Investors Service.
Citing just such cases, the Bank of Japan has long been deflation's biggest cheerleader.
The bank's governor, Masaru Hayami, insists that this particular variety is ''good deflation,'' with suppliers of goods and services able to offer more for less.
But outside the central bank, many economists and even some top government experts warn that Japan risks being sucked into a dangerous deflationary spiral that may only worsen as companies are forced to cut prices and wages repeatedly.
''We have gone beyond the point where the deflation we are seeing can be attributed to globalization and greater competition,'' said Takatoshi Ito, deputy vice minister for international affairs at the Ministry of Finance.
''Deflation is now the mirror image of falling demand, and that's not good deflation.''
Critics of the central bank say that Japanese consumers have no reason to spend despite lower prices.
Not only has the value of their homes plummeted, but unemployment is at a postwar peak of 4.9 percent and is expected to climb more.
''If incomes don't rise in nominal terms -- and they aren't -- you are having to run faster to meet your mortgage obligations,'' said Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.
''And it is not just Mrs. Watanabe who is feeling strapped.
Every sector here, whether we talk about the banks, corporations, households or the government is highly leveraged.''

Even though prices are falling, many incomes are falling faster.
Instead, bonuses shrank by half a percent, as companies spent their hard-earned cash to offset their increasingly painful debts.
A number of economists, however, argue that Japan needs more deflation as a form of shock therapy: fewer debts, greater efficiency and a reallocation of labor, they say, is precisely the bitter medicine the economy must swallow.
''If deflation continues, inevitably it will put further downward pressure on wages, and if wages are cut, then prices will have to fall, too,'' said Tadashi Nakamae, an outspoken economist who runs his own consulting firm.
''I think Japan needs to accept that.
Later, it will be offset by higher growth.''
The question is whether Japan can tolerate the pain of waiting patiently for such benefits of deflation to appear.
Already, textile manufacturers are urging the government to curb the imports that underpin Uniqlo's success.
Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of Finance, which once supported the Bank of Japan's monetary policy, are growing increasingly worried about deflation's devastating impact on the national budget.
They are pushing the Bank of Japan to lower its already low interest rates, print more money, buy government bonds, do anything short of dropping bank notes out of helicopters to combat deflation.
And even Mr. Hayami, the top central banker, has begun suggesting that, if the economy continues to deteriorate, the bank may abandon its staunch resistance to buying government bonds to expand the money supply.
That may come too late, however, to prevent a very grim future for Mr. Matsushita and his family, along with millions of Japanese who owe more on their homes than they are worth.
He and others in his apartment complex have sued the government, which owns it and had dropped the price of unsold units to dispose of them.
But they will have a hard time proving their case, for they are victims less of bureaucratic bungling than of powerful market forces.
But Yamaichi went bust, shattering his dreams of a leisurely old age.
Now Mr. Matsushita works as a security guard at night and part-time in a convenience store during the day.
''I might sell this place, and if I'm lucky, I might then have 10 million yen in hand to rent a little house in the country and live off of my pension money,'' he said.
''My living standard will go down, but I still have some hope.''
''Mir's deorbit is tentatively set for March 20, give or take a day,'' said Viktor Blagov, deputy chief at Russia's mission control in Korolyov, near Moscow.
Waiting until the station is closer leaves more fuel for the final maneuvers, officials said.

On Mir's final day in space, controllers plan to stabilize the slowly rolling station before the attached Progress freighter fires its engines at least twice to push the low point of the spacecraft's orbit deeper into the atmosphere at a point above the target area.
When the station is aligned with its target, the Progress will perform a long final engine burn to drop Mir out of orbit and into the atmosphere at a steep angle toward its target in the Pacific.
Mir is now so close to the earth that scientists predict it will have come down on its own at the end of the month in an uncontrolled plunge somewhere along its flight path, which covers 80 percent of the planet.
The Russians have worked hard to avoid this potentially destructive alternative and bring Mir down in a safe place.
Mir's remains are supposed to come down in the Pacific in an area 1,850 miles east of the southern tip of New Zealand, a region with no islands and little air and sea traffic.
The debris is supposed to fall in an elliptical ''footprint'' midway between New Zealand and Chile, a target area perhaps 1,000 miles long, and about 120 miles wide at the beginning, tapering down to 20 or 25 miles at the end.
Also aboard is a docking compartment for visiting American space shuttles and the Progress freighter.
Four of the laboratory sections are attached at right angles to the core like a clover leaf and most of the segments have winglike solar panels attached to their sides.
As Mir dives into the atmosphere, experts said, aerodynamic forces will first strip off the solar panels and thermal radiators of sheet aluminum, which should flutter to the ocean.
Ruptures caused by parts tearing off and air friction generating heat as high as 3,000 degrees will probably cause the pressurized modules to break loose and explode, creating a display of smoking, incandescent fragments plummeting through the sky.
Experts expect 40 propellant tanks, many large batteries, metal storage boxes and heavy metal bulkheads to survive re-entry to hit the ocean at the narrow end of the target area at speeds of up to 150 miles an hour.
Some lighter debris, possibly including clothing and insulating foam, should float down into the broad end of the impact zone.
Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist for orbital debris studies at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, and other experts say the Russians have more experience bringing down used spacecraft than anyone else.
Since 1978, they have taken five early Salyut space stations and 80 Progress spacecraft out of orbit in the same Pacific area, Mr. Johnson said.
The deorbiting technique is exactly the same.
Mir's just a bit bigger.''

While experts are confident that the Russians can bring down Mir as planned, there are concerns.
Japan, Australia and New Zealand, near Mir's final orbit, have set up monitoring groups that could rush aid to citizens should debris hit their countries.
Last week, the 16 states of the South Pacific Island Forum, including Papua New Guinea and the Cook Islands, asked Russia for assurance that debris would not threaten them.
History shows some reason for concern when large spacecraft come down, though none are known to have caused serious injuries, deaths or major property damage.

Pieces traveled farther than expected, falling harmlessly in western Australia.
Dr. William Ailor, director of space debris studies for the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, Calif., said the chances were quite small that a person would be hurt by space debris, which is constantly raining in, unnoticed by most people.
The risk of being hurt by a piece of a falling spacecraft is about one in a trillion, he said, compared with the 1 in 1.4 million chance of being hit by lightning.
But Dr. Ailor said Mir's controlled re-entry still posed risks because so many things could go wrong, like engine misfirings, the station tumbling too much or too little in its final stages or coming apart in an unexpected way.

''Everything has to go right for this to work as designed,'' he said.
''A lot of things can happen in the lower atmosphere that you can't predict.''
The United States has encouraged Russia for years to abandon Mir and concentrate its meager resources on the new International Space Station being built in orbit by a consortium of 16 nations, led by the United States and Russia.
Now that Mir is coming down, NASA is careful to say that this is Russia's decision and that the United States is playing only a minor role by passing along tracking information.
Although NASA has no major role in Mir's re-entry, the agency is interested in what happens as a lesson that may apply when the larger International Space Station has to be brought down in 20 or 30 years, said Dr. Jack Bacon, a space station engineering expert at the Johnson Space Center.
''We are anxious to get any information we can about bringing in an object of this size so that we can refine our own re-entry scenarios,'' Dr. Bacon said.
Because Russia can track Mir only when it is over its territory, Moscow has asked the United States and Europe to monitor the space station's descent as well.
Information from this will help Russian controllers refine their maneuvers and determine whether Mir comes down where it is supposed to.
The United States Space Command, which monitors 8,300 earthly objects in space from its headquarters in Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., will use radar and telescopes to provide Russia with information about Mir's trajectory, and about atmospheric conditions.
Maj. Perry Nouis, a spokesman for the command, said the data would be fed to Johnson Space Center, which would then relay it to the Russian control center using high-speed links set up between the two for the International Space Station.
As the Russians fine-tune Mir's descent, Major Nouis said, the Air Force will relay increasingly precise predictions about where the station will enter the deep atmosphere on its final pass.
About two hours before entry, the Space Command will issue its main prediction of the time Mir will leave orbit, plus or minus 15 minutes.
Space Command involvement will end after it verifies that Mir is no longer in orbit, Major Nouis said.
The American tracking information will also be fed to the Pentagon's National Military Command Center, where it will be shared with the White House and interested agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the State Department and the Federal Aviation Administration.
''Nobody is more competitive and more committed than him,'' forward Kris Lang said.

By Carolina standards, it is too early to deem Doherty's debut a ringing success.
The next few weeks will determine that.
North Carolina fans, as Doherty well knows -- he was a three-year starter for the Tar Heels -- are accustomed to watching their team play late into March.
But Doherty, a Long Island native who calls himself a blunt-talking Irishman, is secure that he has established himself as his own man.
He is also convinced that he has done it the Carolina way, despite the doubts of many when he first arrived in Chapel Hill last summer.
''
Doherty has distinguished himself in other ways, too.
He confesses to a temper that can be ignited by anything from someone trying to cut in line ahead of him and his family, to the occasional lackadaisical play of his team.
Over the course of his first season, he has thrown a chair in the locker room at halftime and once tossed center Brendan Haywood out of practice.
''It won't hurt your image to play defense,'' Doherty told him.
Doherty also quotes Rolling Stones songs and is the first to offer fist bumps when a player comes off the court.

In other words, Doherty has brought some mercury to a program that, for 36 seasons under Dean Smith and his successor, Bill Guthridge, was all about keeping the diamond that was Tar Heel basketball in a cool, consistent showplace.
That meant going to Wall Street for three and a half years as a bond salesman.
''It's like having a girlfriend dump you,'' he said.
Neither was being a headhunter in Charlotte, N.C., for a year.
What was really cool, however, was being a radio analyst for Davidson College and coaching an Amateur Athletic Union team of 14-year-olds in the Charlotte area.
''It's about evaluating talent, making decisions, organizing practices,'' Doherty explained.
''It goes beyond the X's and O's.
Doherty dismisses the suggestion that his youth and thin résumé might earn him some patience and understanding from an insatiable alumni spoiled by Final Four appearances.
''That gets my competitive juices flowing,'' he said.
''I think I'm a very good coach myself.
Besides, this is North Carolina: they expect as much from me as I do from myself.''
Many financial reforms of the past two decades presupposed that small investors could govern their financial destiny.
By the end of the 1990's, mutual funds eclipsed banks as the major repository of savings.
Touched by pre-bubble optimism, the Bush administration touts private Social Security accounts to enhance retirement savings.
Now, after the Alice-in-Wonderland behavior of novice investors in the technology mania, this trend toward ''democratized'' investing will be questioned.

To some investors, it may seem poetic justice that their Wall Street mentors should share in the punishment.
This fusion of wholesale and retail firms produced glaring conflicts of interest.
Meanwhile, an unholy combination of venture capitalists and investment bankers teamed up to fob off phantom companies -- sometimes mere artists' conceptions of companies rather than going concerns -- on the public.
Wall Street firms grew to bloated sizes that will be no more sustainable than the Nasdaq bubble itself.
Concern has centered on the misery of small investors maimed in the tech wreckage.
The market has functioned as a vast, erratic mechanism for misallocating capital across America.

The sheer number of companies going public guaranteed an indigestible surplus of new stock.
Though the most dire effects of the Nasdaq bubble may be self-contained, there are worrisome signs that it has spread, and not just to other stocks.
Look at any financial or high-tech center, and you will see that funny money from the Nasdaq flowed into local real estate, blowing up more bubbles.
In their haste to establish brand names, dot-coms funneled Nasdaq money into costly advertising campaigns, providing a fleeting bonanza for media companies.
The most serious glut may appear among the dot-coms' suppliers, like Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems, which must compete against a secondhand market in their own Internet equipment -- used goods auctioned off after the demise of dot-com customers.
In despair, many investors now pray for divine intervention -- that is, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board.
The last casualty of the Nasdaq bubble may well be the Fed's aura of invincibility.
In the aftermath of a speculative boom, the policy options become terribly limited.
Almost without question, we will see more interest rate cuts at the Fed's March 20 meeting.
At the same time, an easy money policy, however necessary and welcome, won't remedy the structural imbalances produced by the bubble.
If history proves an accurate guide, the bust may mirror it in depth and duration.
Many were looking to the Producer Price Index for February, to be released today, for a further indication of how aggressively the Federal Reserve might cut rates at its meeting on Tuesday.
Until the stock market fell sharply twice this week, many on Wall Street had expected a half-point reduction, but some are now talking about a cut of three-quarters of a percentage point.
''What you're seeing,'' said Jonathan Glaser, a hedge fund manager at JMG Capital Partners, ''is some optimism over the Fed coming to the rescue here and people trying to find some bargains.
It's very quiet, at least for the moment.
I think we're on hold.''
The Dow industrials rose 57.82 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,031.28, rebounding from a drop exceeding 3 percent on Wednesday that resulted in its closing below 10,000 for the first time in five months.

''Over the last several days, you have seen at least the beginning of a rotation into some of the beat-up technology companies,'' said William V. Fries, manager of the Thornburg Value Fund.
Underlying the market's recent performance are concerns over the weakening American economy and a continuing series of warnings of disappointing corporate financial results.
''Clearly, the market knows the next couple of quarters are going to stink,'' Mr. Glaser said.
''The major question is whether we'll see some turnaround later in the year for earnings, or whether we're in a protracted period of low growth or no growth for some of these companies.''
''This is a very anemic rally.''

Treasury Prices Mixed
By Reuters
Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as investors hopd for an aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.78 percent from 4.82 percent on Wednesday.
''A third cut usually convinces the market that the Fed really wants a recovery,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown.
''On Wall Street there is a saying, 'Don't fight the Fed.'
But for the last week or so people have been wondering if the Fed is fighting hard enough for them.''

There have been 13 periods since 1921 in which the Fed has delivered three rate cuts in relatively quick succession, according to analysts at Ned Davis Research.
The rest of the record is more impressive: for the other periods, the Dow was up an average of 21 percent 12 months after the last of the Fed's three rate cuts.
(The gains are skewed by the 81.6 percent gain after the rate cuts from November 1981 through July 1982, and the 74 percent surge that came after the Fed cut rates in the summer and fall of 1998.)
Of course, there is no guarantee the medicine will work this time.
Several analysts are skeptical that it will.
And compared with past history, the market's response to the January cuts has been extremely poor.
''The odds are at least one in three, and possibly greater than 50 percent, that the market will underperform the 20-odd percent upward trajectory of the past.''
Mr. Roach and others doubt a third rate cut will be able to cure what currently ails the equity market: high valuations, falling earnings and what is seen as a prolonged state of weakness in the technology sector.
Despite the 62.5 percent decline in the Nasdaq since its peak just over a year ago, ''the fundamentals in technology are still terrible,'' said Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company.

''Technology is the lead weight on the market,'' Mr. Bernstein said.
''Any interest rate cuts from here forward will help the rest of the market.
But I am not sure Alan Greenspan can overcome the problems in the tech sector.''

It is certainly true that the two rate cuts so far this year have not done technology much good: the Nasdaq bounced a tidy 6 percent in the 28 days after the first cut on Jan. 3.
But since Jan. 31, when the Fed cut rates again by half a percentage point, the Nasdaq index has fallen more than 31 percent.
The Nasdaq has fallen in the period between the second and third rate cuts before, but only once.
The good news is that in the 12 months after the July 20 cut, the Nasdaq gained more than 81 percent.
Movement in the prices of the stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average since the first rate cut this year is also troubling.
From Jan. 3 to Jan. 31, the date of the second cut, the Dow was basically flat, falling 0.5 percent.
But since the end of January, the blue-chip index has declined 9.6 percent.
The Ned Davis research shows that the Dow stocks fell in reaction to two rate cuts only once before, in 1921.
''The market is probably willing to overlook declining earnings when there is visibility about when the process is going to end and the earnings recovery is going to take place,'' said Tom Van Leuven, an equity market strategist at J. P. Morgan.
''It doesn't seem to us that interest rates have a big impact on the direction of the market,'' he added.
''When we start to see the pace of earnings revisions start to slow, and managements begin to express a bit more optimism about the future, we will feel better about stocks.''
Currently, there are serious doubts that technology shares can rise from the ashes.
But historically they have been the best performers after a third rate cut by the Fed.
Telephone stocks, shares in major regional banks and airline companies were the worst performers, according to the Birinyi study.
''It influenced the size of the homes we live in, the type of cars we drive, how we go on vacation,'' said Douglas R. Cliggott, a strategist at J. P. Morgan Chase.
''Because of the extraordinary improvement in the average American's net worth, it made us feel comfortable carrying what by historic standards would have been an extraordinary amount of debt.''
Already, the stock market's fall has put a dent in Americans' wealth.
The loss of wealth reflects the fact that by 1999 Americans had 60 percent of their investments and savings in the stock market, double the proportion they had in 1982, according to J. P. Morgan Chase.
And that understates the real figure, since retirement funds like 401(k)'s are excluded.
Never before in American history has the wealth of so many been tied to Wall Street's fortunes.
''Now, they're watching CNBC.''
The bull is now, at best, wounded.
Now some of the highest flyers in the boom are dead, and even the best are down 50 percent or more from their highs.
The Nasdaq composite, dominated by technology stocks, is now down 63 percent from its peak of last March while the Dow, which had held up much better because of its old-economy concentration, is off 16 percent from its peak, after losing almost 8 percent last week.
The Standard & Poor's 500, a widely followed index of large companies, is down 25 percent from its high.
If the bull is dead or dying, it will leave a society that has depended on it far more than anyone could have anticipated even a decade ago.
Corporate America went deeply into debt to buy back stock and obtain shares to issue to employees, confident that share prices would keep rising.

Family finances were reshaped.
Far fewer companies now offer traditional defined-benefit pension plans that promise guaranteed incomes to retirees.
Instead they offer defined-contribution benefit plans like 401(k)'s, where the investment risk belongs to the beneficiary.
When times were good, with stock prices rising and inflation quiet, people felt comfortable saving little money outside of their 401(k)'s.
Now, if the perception spreads that the days of easy money are over, that could persuade Americans to save more to finance their retirements.
Savers would benefit in the long run, but the adjustment would further depress economic activity in the short run, damaging business profits and perhaps hurting stock prices even more.
To comply with the new accounting requirements, companies would have to find ways to make large contributions to their pension plans.
Or, they could find ways to reduce their obligations.
In that atmosphere the trend toward defined-contribution plans took off.

American business was embarking on a golden age as its efforts to become more competitive bore fruit.
The lesson learned was not that stocks are risky; it was that money is to be made by buying when prices fall.
But as more options were exercised to buy shares, companies worried that shareholders would be offended that their stake was falling -- dilution is the Wall Street word -- because of the new shares being issued.
''I used to get that look that people reserve for benign idiots and small children when I would say that Amazon.com would have to become the retail sales industry for the United States to grow into the market capitalization it had at its peak,'' recalled Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company.
Amazon is now down 90 percent.
Where once the dream was to start a business and watch it grow and become profitable, more and more seemed to see the initial public offering as the end point, when the money would have been made.
Now the illness of the bull, and speculation that it has already died, has put new pressure on Americans to decide whether stocks are still the best long-term investment and that buying on dips is a good strategy.
So far, Americans seem to be putting much less money into stocks but to be avoiding selling if they can.
With Treasury bonds paying less than 5 percent interest, the investment alternatives are not especially attractive.
Mr. Glauber, the N.A.S.D.
chief executive, expresses confidence that the old aversion to stocks will not return.
''I think they will still conclude that equities are an important part of their long-term portfolio,'' he said.
On Wall Street, most strategists think the stock market is at or near a bottom.

All week, the president talked about the economy ''sputtering,'' and he wrapped up the week on Saturday by beginning his weekly radio address to the nation this way: ''Good morning.
For several months, economic indicators have pointed toward a slowdown, and now many Americans are starting to feel its impact.

The fact of the matter is that the stock market did have a very bad week -- its worst in 11 1/2 years -- and many people are beginning to feel the pinch.
But the economic news is not universally bad.
Retail sales remain relatively strong, particularly for big-ticket items like cars.
Almost certainly, given the growth in jobs, the economy is not now in a recession.

But shortly after the election, weaknesses began to appear.
With the outcome of the election still being contested, Mr. Bush and his associates jumped at the opportunity to attribute the weakness to the Democratic administration.
A week later, he told reporters: ''I keep hearing talk about, you know, well, this is an administration that is trying to talk down the economy.
That's foolish talk.
All of us in the Bush administration will want the economy to be strong.
But there are some clear warning signs, warning signs that will require what we believe is important action in the halls of Congress, such as tax relief.''
On Jan. 3, after the Federal Reserve Board lowered interest rates for the first time in more than two years, Mr. Bush declared that a tax cut was ''an integral part of economic recovery'' -- recovery being a term usually used to describe what happens when the economy begins to grow after a recession.

On Feb. 8, when he sent his tax bill to Congress, he said: ''The warning signs are clear.
All of us here in Washington, the president and the Congress, are responsible to confront the danger of an economic slowdown and to blunt its effects.''
On Feb. 13, there was a bit of good economic news, a report showing strong growth in retail sales in January.
Asked about it by a reporter traveling with him on Air Force One, Mr. Bush said, ''I think it's one good statistic amongst a sea of some pretty dismal statistics.''
Last week, Democrats in Congress came close to blaming Mr. Bush for the bad stock market by saying that to bolster the case for a tax cut, he had scared consumers and investors.
''I think what we're seeing is a talking down of the economy,'' said Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives.
''I think that kind of economic leadership is irresponsible.
I think it's mismanagement of our economy.''
But Mr. Bush's defenders discount the Democratic statements as petty politics.
''To suggest that the president's words have caused any of these actions,'' said Ari Fleischer, the press secretary, ''is as wrong as wrong can be.''

No one doubts that Europe is slowing down, but there is much less agreement about how serious and widespread the trend will be.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In the last month, most private economists have trimmed their forecasts for European growth to 2.5 percent from about 3 percent.
But that is still well above current predictions for the United States.
''It is too early to pull down the shutters,'' said Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt.
''If we get another two months of this and the numbers stay at this level, then there would be reason to worry.''
The picture in Europe is far from homogenous.
Signs of a slowdown are most acute in Germany, which is heavily dependent on exports outside Europe and which has been slow to liberalize its labor markets.
But France, the next largest economy in Europe, remains fairly buoyant, and smaller countries like the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland are still growing quickly.
Ireland, in fact, has drawn an official rebuke from the European Union over tax cuts that may overheat its economy.
Even in Germany, many manufacturers are still doing well, especially those that export mainly to Europe rather than to the United States.
''We have the biggest backlog of orders right now that we have ever had,'' said Wieland Schmitz, a spokesman for MAN A.G., which makes trucks, buses, printing systems and other heavy equipment.
MAN's situation contrasts sharply with Freightliner, the American truck-making subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler, which is struggling with a sharp slowdown in the American market.
In part because only 10 percent of MAN's exports go to the United States, it still foresees solid growth this year and next.
Nevertheless, anxiety is on the rise, once again putting the European Central Bank in a tight spot.
So far, the bank has resisted following the Federal Reserve with interest rate cuts of its own because it worries more about inflation.
But few economists believe the bank's forecast that Europe can still grow 3 percent this year, and unemployment across Europe remains at an uncomfortably high level of nearly 9 percent even after last year's economic growth.

As for inflation, it is already above the central bank's self-imposed ceiling of 2 percent annually, and the euro is again sputtering.
A move to perk up growth with easier money could aggravate both trends.
''They cannot follow the Fed, and they shouldn't,'' said Alfred Boss, an economist at the Kiel Institute for World Economics in Germany.

Without changes like lower taxes and more flexible rules on hiring and firing, Mr. Boss said, it is ''highly improbable'' that Germany can grow any faster than 2.1 percent in 2001 and 2.5 percent thereafter, even with a cut in interest rates.
''The U.S. slowdown could affect the confidence of businesses and consumers in the U.K., but it had not done so yet.''
Thomas Mayer, senior European economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt, said Germany's abrupt loss of confidence might stem in part from frustration over economic reform, not the broader European economic picture.
''The message of this survey is that this is mostly a German problem, rather than a European problem,'' Mr. Mayer said, referring to the German business sentiment data.
By contrast, executives at Alcatel, the French telephone equipment maker, remain fairly optimistic.
''If you take the last two to three years, telecommunication investment in Europe has been 50 percent of what it has been in the United States, and the economies are the same size,'' Mr. Halbron said.
And it coincided with a government decision to reinforce rules that give workers a say in corporate decision making, which Mr. Mayer said ''put German industry in a very, very sour mood.''
''We have to speed things up,'' he told reporters in Brussels today, where a special meeting on economic reform is set for the weekend.
São Paulo's benchmark Bovespa index fell 5.34 percent, closing at 14,046.19.
Meant to stabilize the falling value of Brazil's currency, the real, and to keep inflation from igniting, the interest rate move wound up worsening the growing concern over the Brazilian economy's prospects, economists said.
''They could have insisted a little more with the foreign-exchange markets.''
Concerns over increasing instability in Argentina, the apparent slowing of the American economy, and disappointment over Brazil's yawning current account deficit have pushed the real down in value 5.3 percent this month, to 2.161 to the dollar, a two-year low.
''Before this, the market had the perception that the central bank would not take such a strong move.''

Over the last 11 months, the central bank's policy committee has been lowering rates.
The benchmark short-term rate, known as Selic, which the bank briefly pushed up to 45 percent to head off a run on the real, has been falling steadily from 19.50 percent in the aftermath of the 1999 devaluation.
Business leaders and politicians continue to demand a significant reduction in interest rates, arguing that Brazilian industry needs lower borrowing costs to increase the competitiveness of Brazilian products in world markets.
Economists say that while the fundamentals of the Brazilian economy remain strong, a growing financial crisis and political turmoil in Argentina have made investors in Brazil increasingly nervous.
Doubts remain whether the newly appointed Argentine economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, will be able to push through an emergency economic package and pull the country out of a long recession.
There was also some concern that his plan to unilaterally alter tariffs would be disruptive to Mercosur, the four-nation trade bloc led by Brazil that also includes Uruguay and Paraguay.
Until there is some clarification of the Argentine situation, analysts said, markets in both countries will remain rocky and prone to sharp reactions to developments on either side of the border.
''It's a good sign, but there have been a lot of good signs already that have not played out,'' said John Manley, senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.

Other analysts still say the corporate earnings outlook could worsen and that stock prices do not reflect that yet.
And some say that investors are still too eager to catch the bottom and ride it up.
''Bottoms are made when people give up,'' said Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch.
And over the last two weeks, the Dow has plunged 10.7 percent, the worst two-week decline since the stock market crash of 1987.
Still, the Dow, based on its closing price, is the only major index that has not dropped 20 percent or more from its peak, for many on Wall Street the borderline of bear market territory.
With the rally yesterday, it is down 18.9 percent from its January 2000 peak.
But the Nasdaq is still down 61.8 percent from its March 2000 high.
But other big-name technology stocks were sold, indicating that investors moving back into this sector are being selective.
It is down 7.6 percent in the last two weeks, its sharpest slide since the April 2000 plunge in the stock market.
The S.& P. is off 25.4 percent from its March 2000 high.

While they differ on what it means for the outlook for the market, both Mr. Manley and Mr. Bernstein agree that there are investors with cash ready to buy again, which helps explain yesterday's rally.
''I am amazed at the amount of interest in the tech sector given the bear market it has been in,'' Mr. Bernstein said.
''People are on the sideline waiting to get in.''
And the outlook for stocks in the longer term, he said, has to be positive because ''it is very hard to build a case that the Fed will not get its way'' -- an economic rebound.
Still, Motorola, the cell phone manufacturer, reminded investors again yesterday of the pain that many companies are going through to adjust to the decline in demand as the economy slows sharply.
The company announced that it would lay off more workers, this time 4,000 in the network equipment business.
Since December, Motorola has announced layoffs of about 22,000 workers and the company said last month that it might have a loss in the first quarter.
Some investors also say that interest rates are already low enough to account for the future cuts expected from the Fed.
The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 16/32, to 101 18/32.
The yield on the Treasury's two-year note, which is a good indicator of investor sentiment about coming Fed rate cuts, rose to 4.23 percent from 4.17 percent Thursday.
The rebound of the Dow at the end of the day on Thursday appeared to help foreign markets, which have also fallen sharply recently.
There was a sign that the European Central Bank might be ready to cut interest rates.
''While we were very, very worried about inflation a month or a month and a half ago, we're not anymore,'' Bloomberg News reported Mr. Trichet saying in an interview with the French radio station Europe 1.
Both indexes fell more than 5 percent Thursday amid rumors that Argentina's currency peg to the dollar would be abandoned.

Their grandmother and sole guardian, Arlene Cruz, 55, who gathered them from New Jersey foster homes four years ago, now had to try to deliver them clean, fed and in uniforms to their Manhattan public school, starting from a different shelter each morning.
But Jamall, 11, an honors student, could not speak.
''He has the best understanding of what's going on,'' Jamall's school counselor, Alana Reed, said later.
''He has a sense of responsibility for his siblings and his nana.''
For families like Jamall's, the Emergency Assistance Unit is the mandatory first step.
It is perennially in violation of court orders to enforce New York City's right to shelter, and the city's commissioner of homeless services recently acknowledged that it functions as a kind of gantlet.
''I can't screw the front door any tighter,'' said the commissioner, Martin Oesterreich, referring to tough screening procedures adopted in 1996 to discourage any parent with a housing alternative from using the shelters as a shortcut to a subsidized apartment.
What that means in practice is usually hidden from public view.
Citing privacy, city officials have taped brown paper over the windows of the unit, at 151 East 151st Street, and barred reporters.
But the experiences recounted by Jamall and his siblings, and corroborated by city, school and medical records and interviews with the adults in their lives, make the consequences for children hard to miss.
Their grades suffered.

''I'm drained, but I've just got to keep going,'' Ms. Cruz said late last month, as tears slid silently down Jamall's cheeks.
''I don't want them to take my grandkids and put them back in foster care.''
''My biggest worry is that they find us ineligible and we have to leave,'' he said.
''And that they're going to take us from our grandma because we don't have a place to live.''
Becoming Homeless
Jamall and Paris vividly remember the day five years ago when New Jersey child welfare workers, citing parental neglect and drug use, took them from their mother, Maya, and stepfather, Ronald Jones, who is Tara and Ronald's father.
She was then living in rural South Carolina, after raising seven daughters in New York, where she had worked in factories, on switchboards, and for the Federal Bankruptcy Court as a clerk for 13 years.
For three years, Ms. Cruz made ends meet by adding a shift as a hospital aide to her supermarket job and by qualifying for food stamps.
She had problems paying the bills and stuff.
She said she couldn't take it no more.''
The children's own parents could not help.
The father of Jamall and Paris had recently been released from prison and lives in one room; their mother is in residential drug treatment in Philadelphia.
On Dec. 29, when she insisted that they leave -- ''It's too disruptive, too crowded, too expensive and has become overwhelming and a burden,'' she later wrote to city officials -- they turned to the shelters.
Some things that happened there are hard for Jamall, Paris, Tara and Ronald to forget.
''We couldn't bring no food inside.

There was the time Jamall had strep throat and their grandmother caught pink eye.

The children devoured the rolled-up slices standing between the inner and outer doors of the unit, trying to stay out of the wind.
By 6 a.m., they would be roused by a shelter worker's banging on the door and sent out to wait for the bus back again.
They began to arrive weary and late to the brightly lighted classrooms of the East Harlem Block School, where each morning students recite the school mission: ''to enable every student to achieve his/her personal best performance in all areas of their education and human development.''
The children could not enroll in the after-school program.
''Jamall, who normally shows a tough exterior, has cried through our last two sessions as he described his nights in the shelter and his fears that his family would never have a home.''
''If something is not done to help this family,'' Tara's second-grade teacher, Nyesha Patterson, wrote, ''four young lives will be destroyed.''
But after days of cycling the family through overnight beds, the city ruled that they were not truly homeless, as it typically does even in applications for shelter that are ultimately accepted.
''If they find us ineligible, we have to start all over again,'' Paris explained.
''We already started over five times.
They keep on saying we can go back to our aunt, but there's only three rooms and too much people and the landlord don't want so much noise.''
Ms. Cruz tried to challenge the city's ruling on Jan. 22 at what is known as a ''fair hearing,'' held in a Brooklyn office.
At 4 a.m. on Jan. 30, they were still waiting for a shelter assignment when a unit worker announced that the remaining families would get no beds that night.
''It's almost like getting punished for hitting bottom -- something you couldn't help,'' said Ms. Cruz, who has since been told she needs treatment for a thyroid disorder.
''You see homeless people and you feel bad and then you turn around and you realize, 'I'm homeless.
I am homeless with all these children.'
''This is a very typical case, and the impact on children is on the one hand appalling, on the other hand, all too common,'' said Steven Banks, director of Legal Aid's Homeless Rights Project.
''There are 5,500 families in the shelter system, and five Legal Aid staff members to try to correct mistakes that the city makes on an individual case-by-case basis.''
That is the reason Legal Aid sues the city for overall relief, he added.
But the longstanding battle to enforce court decrees seems to have reached a new impasse.
Despite renewed promises of compliance made by the city last month, there were families left to sleep on the floors of the unit through 6 of the last 10 nights, including 113 children, city records show.
And now, like Ms. Cruz and her grandchildren, most of the applicants are shuttled back and forth to shelters each night -- a practice the city is under a new court order to end.
A confluence of factors is at work, current and former officials say.
Part of the problem, Mr. Koerner said, is that ''doubled-up families living in harsh conditions'' see the shelters as the only route to an apartment of their own.

''There are some homeless people, certainly,'' he added, ''but a lot of them are not truly homeless.
You have to have a way of differentiating that or you don't have a functioning program.''
He added: ''Over all, it works O.K.
It's a very hard situation.
I'm not going to say there aren't mistakes made.''
Typically, the number of families seeking shelter declines in winter, when children are in school, and swells in summer.
''It's all catching up to them,'' Mr. Banks said.
''All the cuts in housing, the failure to address the gap between rents and incomes, the failure to have an appropriate program for survivors of domestic violence.''
Jamall, whose family is still waiting for an opening in a regular family shelter, has reached his own conclusions about why the system works the way it does.
''I think they don't want us to have our education,'' he said.
''Because they don't give us enough sleep to not fall asleep in class.''

And people are eager to turn a standard-issue bathroom into something much more.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
When it comes to fantasy, ''women dream about unwinding, men about water pressure -- bigger showers, more invigorating showers and multiple shower heads,'' said Mary Reid, a vice president for industrial design at Kohler, the plumbing fixtures company in Kohler, Wis.
Though lively fantasies drive many bathroom overhauls, an investment in new fixtures and flooring often pays off, said Paul Deffenbaugh, the editor in chief of the trade magazine Remodeling.
His research indicates that homeowners recoup 82 percent of a small bathroom rehab (average cost: less than $10,000).
A new bathroom (costing about $14,000) gives back 72 percent.
Because labor and materials are more expensive in New York City -- and new bathrooms require plenty of both -- the bottom line is likely to be at least $15,000.
A shaky stock market may make people think twice about doing a renovation, said Kermit Baker, an author of ''Remodeling Homes for Changing Households,'' from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard.
But as he pointed out, ''the flip side is the decline in interest rates,'' which for home equity loans are now down around 8 percent.
''I suspect that contractors are more receptive to returning your phone call,'' he added.
''If you're not affected by the stock market, and have been waiting to do a project, it's a good time.''
Cosmetic improvements can make a big difference, said Michael McDonough, a New York architect, ''but once you tear out the bathtub or move walls, that blows the budget to smithereens.''
He suggests starting with a wish list that may involve something as simple as softer lighting.
Whatever the budget, it pays to shop around.
The renovated room is 8 by 5 feet, but feels larger because it is so luminous.
A haze of color, the walls are washed in pale blues, reds and greens, and muted under sheets of frosted glass from Allstate Glass in Manhattan.
''You can't have hot spots.
If you spray a dot of blue, you will end up with that blue, but if you combine colors, it's a little bit like a Rothko painting.''
''It bonds better when you screw into wood, and not into metal,'' Mr. Ahari said.
The floor is 12-inch squares of travertine from Country Floors in Manhattan.
Handmade Moroccan tiles, also from Country Floors, form a border on the counter.
THE RED ROOM, 90 SQUARE FEET: $70,000 -- ''This is the husband's bath,'' said Carl D'Aquino, an interior designer and partner in D'Aquino Monaco in Manhattan, of the brilliant red bath with custom-designed fixtures, Page 1 of this section.

For the walls and shower door, he and Paul Laird, an architect at D'Aquino Monaco, laminated watermelon-colored Thai fiber paper from Kate's Paperie in SoHo between two sheets of glass.
The floor is granite, and the custom oval sink is cast glass, with a sand-blasted steel base.
THE ROMAN BATH, 250 SQUARE FEET: $50,000 -- In this tranquil cream-colored room, created by Mr. D'Aquino and his partner, Francine Monaco, an architect, beauty lies in simplicity, and in the suggestion of an ancient Roman bath.
There are only a few essential but graceful objects: a claw-foot tub, a hanging milk-glass lamp, a 19th-century column, a stone urn that doubles as a laundry basket.
Aside from a mirrored medicine cabinet, the walls are bare.
Each area has a quietly felt boundary.
''The shower is a crystal box,'' Ms. Monaco said.
The shower floor is a continuation of the terrazzo floor, and the walls are limestone (most of the materials and fixtures came from Ann Sacks Tile & Stone in Manhattan).
A small stone slab cantilevered from the wall serves as a bench.
When the doors, whose glass is from Bendheim, the glass company in TriBeCa, are open, the view from the bed is just a discreet gleaming turquoise tiled column.
When the doors are closed, they keep humidity out of the bedroom.
Made of four-inch squares of Interstyle glass tiles with a faint green cast, sold at Nemo Tile in the Flatiron district, the backsplash provides a soft glow that contrasts with the sleek finish of the square counter (a single sheet of stainless steel bent at a right angle).
A round Kohler sink and an adjustable round mirror from Alu, a manufacturer of store fixtures in Manhattan, provide more contrast.
The floor is paved with three-quarter-inch-square pale green tiles, from Bisazza Mosaico in Manhattan.
DIVIDE AND CONQUER, 95 SQUARE FEET: $16,300 -- Anyone opposed to adjusting the temperature while standing vulnerably under the shower will appreciate an arrangement devised by Glen Coben, a Manhattan architect, in his home in Harrison, N.Y.
A 4-foot-high-by-2 1/2-foot-wide sheet of glass, half an inch thick (and set in an aluminum channel on the limestone box surrounding the tub), keeps the shower water where it is supposed to be.
Niches between the studs in the walls are perfect towel holders, and a partial wall of blue glass tiles screens the toilet.
The palette is crisp.
Walls of blue Bisazza glass tiles, chosen for their iridescence, sparkle next to walls of white New York subway tiles.
Beige limestone clads the counter, floor and bathtub.

THEORY AND TEXTURE, 35 SQUARE FEET: $18,050 -- House & Home asked Peter Pawlak to redesign an existing 35-square-foot bathroom for a New York apartment, with a budget limit of $20,000.
His innovative plan relied on domestic manufacturers.
To implement it would cost $5,200 in materials and $12,850 in labor.
His design approach rests on a muted palette and richly textured materials.
Mexican blue-green matte tiles, each with a unique coloration, line the shower ($6 a square foot from Dal Tile, 800-933-8453).

''Introducing wood in a bath takes away its sterile appearance and makes it warmer,'' Mr. Pawlak said.
''The fibers give the surface a greater direction and depth.
Stained dark, it looks like a painting on canvas.''
Behind the glass shelves, and in the niche by the tub, he suggests using mirrors for depth, making the tiny room look larger.
CONCEALING AND REVEALING, 50 SQUARE FEET: $13,335 -- ''We're about concealing,'' said S. Russell Groves, a Manhattan architect, who designed a sleek custom-made stainless-steel vanity for an Upper West Side bathroom, placing the cabinet discreetly in the bottom.

The decision by the bank, which sets monetary policy for the 12 nations that have adopted the euro as a common currency, runs counter to moves to lower rates by many other central banks, including the Federal Reserve, in the last few months.
Despite clear signs of slowing growth in Europe, especially in Germany, the European Central Bank decided to leave rates where they are for at least the next two weeks.
Uncertainty about growth and about the central bank's policy has undermined the euro's value against the dollar, even though American economic growth has nearly ground to a halt, while Europe is still expanding at a modest rate.

The euro fell 0.5 percent, to 88.2 cents today, its lowest level since mid-December.
Though many analysts expected it to climb this year, it has lost 6 percent of its value since New Year's Day.

Because the European Central Bank is governed by central bankers from each of the euro countries, cacophony has been a problem before.
And the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, has been criticized for making confusing statements that seemed to cut in different directions at the same time.
But economists say the bank also faces an unusually puzzling environment.
The two biggest national economies, the United States and Japan, have both stalled badly, which will inevitably act as a brake on European growth.
But many European countries are still expanding at a respectable rate, and inflation is still running above the central bank's self-imposed ceiling of 2 percent a year.
Private economists predict that over all, Europe will grow about 2 percent or a little more this year, a much slower pace than in 2000 but faster than what is expected in the United States.
Economists now predict that the European Central Bank will reduce rates at its next meeting, scheduled for April 13.
''Every strategist on the street, including myself, put together a table of how stocks do 12 months after the first rate cut,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Banc Alex.

The market's problems reflect the weakness in the economy, which has slowed to a crawl after years of strong growth.
Information technology companies, which led the boom, have been hardest hit, with many posting weaker-than-expected earnings and layoffs.
With no end to the slowdown in sight, investors are shedding the technology and telecommunications stocks they wanted so desperately for most of the 1990's.
After falling more than half from its peak last March, the Nasdaq composite index dropped another 25.5 percent this quarter, losing 630.26 points to close at 1,840.26.
Individual technology stocks, even market leaders like Cisco Systems, have been even harder hit.
Cisco shares dropped another 59 percent for the quarter and are now down more than four-fifths from their peak last March, wiping out more than $400 billion in shareholder wealth.
(Wall Street generally defines a bear market as a prolonged fall of 20 percent or more in a major index; there is some debate whether the October 1987 crash qualifies, since stocks began to rebound almost immediately after their plunge.)

The Dow Jones industrial average, which is less weighted to technology than the other major indexes, showed the most strength.
Microsoft rose 26.1 percent, after losing 63 percent last year, as investors grew more optimistic about the company's chances for resolving its antitrust battle.
Despite this quarter's problems, many strategists remain optimistic that the market is overdue for a rebound.
The Fed's rate cuts are certain to help the economy eventually, and on a price-earnings basis, the overall market is no longer expensive, the bulls say.
Even some longtime bears have begun to change their stance.

''The market looks a lot better under the surface than it does upfront,'' said Christine A. Callies, the chief American investment strategist for Merrill Lynch.
She noted that many stocks actually bottomed in the fall, and that the stocks of companies whose fates are closely tied to economic growth have already begun to rally.
Their gains show that the worst of the slowdown may be over and that some investors are anticipating a recovery, Ms. Callies said.
''In the first few months of a Fed policy change, not everybody thinks it will work,'' Ms. Callies said.
''I don't think that the turn the market wants to see is very far away.
I think there should be a sustainable rally in the second quarter.''

Treasury Prices Rise
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as a report showing manufacturing activity in the Chicago area sank to 19-year lows in March as separate reports showed consumer confidence and spending remaining resilient.
''I think that the Chicago data is going to suggest to a lot of people that the Federal Reserve is going to have to act more aggressively again and doesn't have time to waste,'' said Kim Rupert, senior economist at Standard & Poor's MMS.
The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.90 percent from 4.99 percent on Thursday.
But complexity alone does not explain the muted anger.
There has also been a marked degree of separation, a sense of distance from the pain.
In Britain, farming accounts for only about one in a hundred jobs -- something disgruntled Londoners are quick to point out.
For all his empathizing with the farmers, Mr. Blair will probably call a general election in May -- something The Sun, Britain's biggest tabloid, supports.

In California, consumers have had even longer to get used to the crisis (the problems with power emerged last year).
The Public Utility Commission is also inflicting the price rises mainly on businesses rather than homes; many consumers will only suffer indirectly.
The prevailing emotion among both Britons and Californians seems to be resignation: ''We had it coming,'' one Hollywood executive explained, using the same words heard often in London.
In many cases, this is linked to a suspicion that people are paying the price for unfettered capitalism.
What on earth, Britons ask, was a farm in Northumberland doing feeding Asian meat to their pigs?
In California, deregulation is often blamed for the energy crisis.
Whether this detached fatalism is realistic is another matter.
It is already clear in Britain that foot-and-mouth is about far more than just farming.
The much bigger tourism industry stands to lose $1.5 billion to $5 billion this year -- twice as much as the farmers.
The deathly quiet that has fallen on many of the more beautiful parts of Britain has been caused not only by the much-cited ''silence of the lambs,'' but also by the silence of American tour buses and holidaying German cyclists.
In California, electricity may be an old industry, but it is the lifeblood of the new economy.
Price rises and, particularly, power cuts threaten not just Silicon Valley, but also California's core competence -- persuading ambitious people from all over the world to come to the state.
Indian programmers will not flock to work in a hot place where the air-conditioning keeps breaking down.
They can get that in Bangalore.
Another reason to be relatively pessimistic about California is that its crisis will last longer.
The acrid smoke drifting across Wordsworth country may be grimly apocalyptic; but by the end of this summer, Britain should have killed or vaccinated enough animals to get rid of the disease.
By contrast, the imbalance between the demand and supply of energy in California may not be fixed until 2003.
And there is already talk that last week's price rise will not be enough to cover the state's bills.
Meanwhile, the deeper arguments about unfettered capitalism seem far from finished.
People throughout Europe, already angry about mad cow disease (which unlike foot-and-mouth is dangerous to humans), call for more barriers against food imports, and more rules for agribusiness.
Consolidation in the slaughterhouse industry helped spread foot-and-mouth, forcing infected animals to be driven around the country.
Economic liberals reply that farming is the most protected and regulated industry in Britain (as it is everywhere in the Western world).
The disease may have been partly spread by farmers' ''bed-and-breakfasting'' sheep, selling animals on a short-term basis just to claim subsidies.
Neither side seems ready to admit that bad luck played a role.
Foot-and-mouth is, literally, a disease that can blow in from anywhere: it is carried by the wind.

While foot-and-mouth might be excused as an act of God, California's electricity mess is man-made.
But by whom?
President Bush has jumped at the chance to imply that environmental regulators have held back the energy industry.
Governor Davis, who clearly still hopes to enter the Democratic primaries in 2004, attacks greedy out-of-state power providers.
EVEN when you reach the heart of the problem, the state's regulatory system, another smog descends.
Many on the left blame liberalization.
Free-marketers reply that ''deregulation'' in the mid-1990's does not deserve that label.
The state protected its incumbent suppliers, making it difficult for competitors to get into the market.
It imposed rules that seem downright Soviet -- rate freezes that oblige suppliers to sell power at a small fraction of the price they pay for it.
The bigger, more complicated arguments about the cause of the crises may recede into the background as long as most Californians and Britons continue to grin and bear it.
If, on the other hand, frustrations, perhaps heightened by gloomier economic news, begin to boil to the surface, the politics could change dramatically.
That will be the test of the coming long hot summers in both Britain and California.
So do we fall to our knees before yet another Irish messiah of a dramatist?
Well, let's stop there.
It is undeniable that without Ireland, Western theater today would be much the poorer.
And Ms. Jones makes her own distinctive contribution to the fine Irish art of theatrical storytelling.

But it should also be noted that the pleasures of ''Stones in His Pockets'' are less literary than kinetic.
To encounter this play on the page would offer few clues as to what the excitement has been about.
Its satire of those superficial, egomaniacal folk who make movies is awfully familiar stuff, especially in the States, where the politics of Hollywood generate more interest than the politics of government.
And Ms. Jones burdens an essentially comic play with a thudding tragic center.
The stones of the title, after all, refer to a suicidal drowning and metaphorically to the oppression of an impoverished rural people fed on unrealizable dreams.
The play treads on cracking ice when it criticizes the cardboard figures and stock situations perpetuated by Hollywood.
Its own characters, as often as not, seem to have been conceived by a cookie cutter.
Then again, without ''Stones,'' we would be denied the joys of Mr. Campion and Mr. Hill splitting like amoebas into all those different people.
And under the agile direction of Ian McElhinney, who knows just how to show off his chameleon stars, the actors command our interest even when the script does not.
The hard-luck heroes of ''Stones'' are Charlie Conlon (Mr. Hill) and Jake Quinn (Mr. Campion), small-town Irishmen in County Kerry who, like most of the locals, have signed on as extras for the big-budget film being shot there.
This affords them not only well-paying jobs, which they sorely need, but also a chance to gawk at the movie makers and fantasize about joining their glamorous ranks.
Disillusion of course is waiting off camera, fueled by Jake's flirtation with a lusty screen goddess and by a local death that the visitors from Hollywood dismiss as a professional inconvenience.
The path this disenchantment takes is well worn.
Thank heavens that Mr. Hill and Mr. Campion walk it so stylishly.

Mr. Campion is tall and angular; Mr. Hill, shorter and rounder.
But when it comes to their turning into the dozen or so other characters in the play, the particulars of anatomy are irrelevant.
Mr. Hill has only to shift his weight and run a finger around one ear to metamorphose into Caroline Giovanni, the beautiful young American star who has a habit of ''going ethnic'' on location.
Mr. Campion bends his back to a 90-degree angle and becomes creaky Mickey, regularly described as one of the oldest surviving extras from ''The Quiet Man.''
Then he bounds into the air, turning, before he lands, into the young, ambitious Aisling, a pretty assistant director with the sort of patronizing air that inspires homicidal urges.
Mr. Hill, in the meantime, has thrust out his stomach to morph into Caroline's bodyguard, aptly described as ''the heavy.''
This is all achieved without props or changes of costume.
Yet each character is as clearly drawn and individual as a caricature by Daumier.
Jack Kirwan's simple single set wittily features a long line of diverse, shabby footwear at the back of the stage.
It's a visual joke that captures the wonder of the evening: how could two actors possibly fill all those shoes?
Mr. McElhinney capitalizes ingeniously on the presto-chango panache of such transformations, letting us see the performers literally step into and out of different characters.
Even as plain old Jake and Charlie, Mr. Campion and Mr. Hill work magicianlike effects.

''Look at her lookin' at us lookin' dispossessed'' is the job description Jake gives to Charlie of their roles as Irish peasants.
With these actors, just looking becomes a frenetic, hilariously self-conscious physical activity.
''Stones in His Pockets'' is definitely longer than it needs to be, and its second act in particular treats serious themes with a capital-letter bluntness that isn't so far away from the Hollywood style it parodies.
On the other hand, where else can you see two men condensing the entire experience of ''Riverdance'' into a choreographic sequence that lasts only seconds?

''Today is a very disappointing day,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen.

But I am not so sure we are going to get that unless the stock market really tanks or the economic numbers are really weak.''

Now comes the second-guessing of Alan Greenspan.
Once held in awe as almost godlike, he suddenly can do no right.
But just as the deification was overdone, so, too, is the current criticism.
Mr. Greenspan has administered our most powerful economic tool -- control over the money supply -- admirably.
History will judge him particularly well for his nimble changes of direction in response to economic indicators, all made without sacrificing his conviction that inflation is our most pernicious economic demon.
And his willingness to defy miserly central banker traditions and make large amounts of credit available after the 1987 stock market crash and again after the 1998 Asian economic crisis may well have averted far more significant economic disruptions.
In the years while Mr. Greenspan has been chairman of the Fedral Reserve, we have had our longest period of steady growth, creation of a huge number of jobs, low inflation and, yes, goodly appreciation in stock values.
Even the Nasdaq stock index, despite its big fall over the ast year, is still more than triple what it was 10 years ago.
Mr. Greenspan is hardly responsible for all of this, of course, but why the carping at him?
It's true that Mr. Greenspan nudged interest rates up prematurely in 1994, and in 1998 he might have shoved them down a bit too much.
Most recently, he has offered uncharacteristically illogical justifications for tax cuts proposed by President Bush.
But monetary policy, relying as it does on economic predictions, is not a perfect science.
And the job has gotten even tougher with the advent of round-the-world trading desks that push markets violently at the slightest provocation, ever more arcane financial instruments, and microscopic tracking of the Fed's every move against arbitrary and often ill-defined ''expectations'' -- all chronicled breathlessly by 24-hour business television broadcast to millions of day traders.

Now we face a particular economic challenge: the aftermath of a speculative binge.
The stampede into foolish ventures can hardly be blamed on Mr. Greenspan, who warned so famously about ''irrational exuberance.''
The $4 trillion that has been lost in the stock markets was built on assumptions of earnings multiplying to the sky and on the fairy dust of dot-com and telecom start-ups; it had no substance.
Even great companies like Cisco couldn't possibly justify their lofty valuations.
And the Dow Jones index wasn't going to 36,000.

Should Mr. Greenspan have moved more aggressively to prick this speculative bubble, as some now suggest?
That lament is particularly curious considering that when we were celebrating the new economy and the purported abolition of inflation and recession, every upward nudge that Mr. Greenspan gave to interest rates was met by a chorus of groans.
In the current circumstance, business needs time to absorb the massive industrial capacity created by the cheap money of equity and venture capital investors, as well as low-cost debt.
Consumers need time to sleep off the hangover of stock market mania.
Americans have been spending more than they could afford, incurring record amounts of debt.
And then there is the threat of fallout from a record trade deficit.
The Nasdaq isn't going back to 5,000, at least not for a while.
Consumers will have to adjust, and that may be still more painful than we can now see.
Even at 1,670, the Nasdaq may well be overvalued, and the rest of the stock market may not be far behind.
The average price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 -- perhaps the most important stock market measure -- is now 23, compared with its long-term average of 15.
Our situation should serve as a humbling reminder to those who wish Mr. Greenspan to do something -- anything -- to make the hurt go away.
We cannot expect miracles from the Fed, but only the slow salve of interest rates gliding prudently down.
Instead of blaming Mr. Greenspan, we should reflect on the willing suspension of disbelief that allowed us to ignore everything we have been taught about sound investing.
We brought this period of drying out upon ourselves.
But now there's good news.
If real wealth can be defined as an unlimited stockpile of your favorite, hard-to-find food, we're all rich these days and, as with Bill Gates, it's all thanks to the personal computer.

The same factors that conspire to keep foods like Lucky Elephant Pink Candy Popcorn ($1 at Always Canadian) from claiming a chunk of highly competitive shelf space in a real store -- relatively low demand, the cost of maintaining unsold inventory in a warehouse, the high price of shipping bulk orders to retail stores -- make these items the ideal sort of merchandise to move online.

In 1638 the Rev.

Thirty-five years later, a dozen Puritan elders from throughout Connecticut (all but one of them Harvard graduates) established an institution to guarantee an adequate supply of reliably orthodox ministers, which the distant and dangerously heterodox Harvard could not provide.
Hence the name Yale College.
In the 20th century there followed schools of forestry, nursing, drama, architecture and management, culminating in today's renowned university.
The Central Core
I egan my visit on a bright Saturday morning on Yale's Old Campus, across from New Haven's Green.
The Old Campus remains an epicenter of the university, providing dormitory accommodation for most freshmen and a site for major ceremonies.
It has Yale's two oldest buildings: Connecticut Hall (1753), a National Historic Landmark that is a deliberate copy of Massachusetts Hall at Harvard, and the former library (1842), the university's first foray into the Gothic Revival architectural style.
(It is now Dwight Hall, the center for public service at Yale.)
On Sept. 21, 1776, while returning from his first mission, to British-held Long Island, Hale was captured in Manhattan.
He was hanged the next day, age 21, his last words said to have been ''I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.''
Crossing High Street from the Old Campus, one enters the world of Yale's 12 residential colleges.
Although there are slightly more Yale graduate students (5,688 in last fall's enrollment) than undergraduates (5,278), the residential colleges define the university.
Each freshman is randomly assigned to a college, though most do not take up residence there until sophomore year.
Eight of Yale's 10 original residential colleges and the principal older buildings at the heart of the campus are the work of James Gamble Rogers, class of 1889.
Rogers's fashioning of Yale's architecture in the 1920's and 30's demonstrates that a technically skilled, meticulous and practical architect need not be stylistically innovative to define an institution's physical identity.
Many of Rogers's most conspicuous buildings are frankly derivative, but fortunately he had impeccable taste.
Wrexham Tower is modeled on the 16th-century tower of St. Giles Church in Wrexham, Wales (where Elihu Yale is buried).
The Law School library is based on the Chapel of King's College, Cambridge, built from 1446 to 1515.

Rogers did not simply parrot some of England's finest medieval structures.
Rogers's gifts are manifest throughout his eight colleges, as well as in his other Yale buildings.
One of his finest works is Branford College, whose four courtyards are flanked by Harkness and Wrexham Towers and enriched throughout with neo-Gothic details.
Highlights include the main entrance, with sculptures by Lee Laurie (whose statue of Atlas is in Rockefeller Center), and the vast Gothic ''nave'' (main hall) decorated with carved reliefs of Yale's early history.
The nave culminates in an ''altar'' (the circulation desk) consisting of a kitschy mural of Alma Mater flanked by depictions of Truth, Music, Divinity and Literature, the creation of a Yale art professor whose name is best forgotten.
The Library's main reading room and cloistered inner courtyard are unusually beautiful places to study or converse (quietly).
Rogers's Law School (1931) and Hall of Graduate Studies (1932) also have tranquil courtyards with charming neo-Gothic details like decorated Romanesque arches and oriel windows.
And don't miss the amusing policeman, robber and judge carved at eye level along the Wall Street facade of the Law School.
Warmth in Poured Concrete
Just behind Mory's, a private eating club on York Street, are two of the four colleges not designed by Rogers.
Constructed of poured concrete, Morse and Stiles nonetheless manage to convey warmth and intimacy, and harmonize with Yale's other colleges.
(The two other colleges not designed by Rogers are Calhoun, the work of John Russell Pope, and Silliman, by Eggers & Higgins.)
The work of Gordon Bunshaft, Beinecke's walls are octagonal panels of Vermont marble whose interior faces vary in amber hue in direct relation to the level of exterior sunlight.
The entrance is a monumental Egyptian Revival gateway (1845) designed by Henry Austin, buried nearby.
Buried in the cemetery are such eminent New Haven personages as Theophilus Eaton, co-founder of the New Haven Colony; Roger Sherman, signer of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation; Noah Webster (class of 1778) of lexicographical fame; Eli Whitney (class of 1792), inventor of the cotton gin; Charles Goodyear, who ''invented'' vulcanized rubber by accident; Ithiel Town, New Haven's finest architect; Walter Camp (class of 1880), the Yale coach known as the ''father of American football''; and many Yale presidents.

I walked from there to nearby Hillhouse Avenue, once called by Charles Dickens the most beautiful street in America.
Its towering elm trees long gone, Hillhouse is less impressive today, although the university is now in the midst of a combined horticultural and architectural renovation along the avenue's main block.
Many of its grand homes have been reincarnated as Yale offices and classrooms.
No.
43, a Georgian Revival mansion, is the residence of Yale's president.
To its right, 37 Hillhouse Avenue houses the economics department but has interesting associations with two recent American presidents, both named Bush.
After World War II Yale subdivided 37 Hillhouse into 13 tiny apartments for returning servicemen and their families.
There were disadvantages to having Yale's president, Charles Seymour, as a neighbor: one day Mr. Seymour is said to have asked Mr. Bush to remove George W.'s diapers from the backyard clothesline because he was expecting an important guest.
Hillhouse Avenue ends at Sachem Street, at the foot of Philip Johnson's three-building science complex, constructed in 1963-65.
One block west is another of Yale's groundbreaking modern buildings, Saarinen's Ingalls Hockey Rink (1958), a soaring structure that prefigures his T.W.A.
Terminal at Kennedy Airport in New York.
Sunday morning is also an ideal time to visit three beautiful churches on the New Haven Green: the United Church on the Green (North Church), the First Church of Christ (Center Church) and Trinity Episcopal Church, all built from 1812-16.
Together they make up the centerpiece of the New Haven Green Historic District, another National Historic Landmark.
Center Church is noteworthy for the portrait of Town in its foyer and for its crypt (New Haven's first burying ground), with gravestones dating back to 1687.
Trinity Church played a pivotal role in America's architectural history; in the words of William H. Pierson Jr., it is ''one of the remarkable churches of the period,'' reflecting ''a decisive turn'' in the Gothic Revival movement just then reaching the United States.
Three other sights surround the Green.
The New Haven Free Public Library, designed by Cass Gilbert and dedicated in 1911, is at the corner of Elm and Temple Streets.
The city's stunningly restored High Victorian City Hall (1861), designed by Henry Austin, is on Church Street, between Elm and Chapel.
In front of City Hall is the Amistad Memorial, erected on the site of the jail in which the Africans who won control of the Amistad slave ship in 1839 were imprisoned while awaiting trial.
Walking back to the Yale campus, I stumbled upon a vestige of the short-lived New Haven Colony -- a large monument behind Center Church that marks the burial place of John Dixwell.
Two other regicides, Edward Whalley and William Goffe, hid for a time in Judges Cave, in what is now West Rock Park, before moving to the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
The regicides are commemorated by three downtown New Haven thoroughfares, Dixwell, Whalley and Goffe.

Art and Panoramic Views
On Sunday afternoon I visited Yale's two outstanding art museums, both of which are free to the public.
The Yale Art Gallery has an excellent, comprehensive collection, and its 1953 extension was the first major commission for the American architect Louis Kahn.
Across the street is Kahn's Center for British Art (1977), completed after his death.
His last work is light, spacious, airy and constructed of beautiful materials: burnished steel, white oak and travertine marble.
It houses a notable assemblage of British paintings displayed along thematic lines.
This building is Brutalism (a short-lived midcentury school) at its most self-consciously brutal -- an oversize, asymmetrical amalgam of rough-hewn beige concrete, colossal colliding members and large expanses of glass.

Since its completion it has been critically controversial, and reviled by art students because of its impractical studio spaces.
But the Art and Architecture Building is indisputably superior to other Yale buildings in one respect: the panoramic views of old Yale from its seventh floor and the adjacent rooftop terrace.
But in the end I was perfectly happy to be in New Haven, an admiring bystander at the 300th birthday of a great university.

Stock prices, in reaction, fell sharply yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average declining 1.3 percent, to 9,791,09, and the Nasdaq falling 3.6 percent, to 1,720.36.
Stocks usually rise in response to a bad employment report, the belief on Wall Street being that the negative news makes the Federal Reserve more willing to cut interest rates.
Lower rates, in turn, make the potential return from stocks more attractive to investors.

The March report indeed raised expectations on Wall Street of lower rates.
Many Wall Street economists called on the Fed to keep cutting interest rates, until they are down to 3 percent or so, from the present 5 percent level.
''You see some signs of stability,'' said James Glassman, senior domestic economist for J. P. Morgan Chase & Company.
''Hours worked rose a bit, and so did average hourly pay, which suggests that consumer income and consumer spending are holding up.
This report by itself fails to justify a quick rate cut.''
The Labor Department, reinforcing this view, revised the job numbers for January and February -- adding 77,000 jobs for those months.
The Bush administration, citing the jobs report, urged Congress to approve its tax cut proposals.
''The new unemployment numbers show that the patient isn't getting any better, so it is time to prescribe some medicine,'' said Elaine Chao, the secretary of labor.
But others, including several Fed officials, have argued recently that the economy still may have enough strength to avoid a recession, particularly if consumer spending remains strong.
That view is shared by Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis.
''What you count on to stay out of a recession is the consumer holding up,'' he said.
''That may require a stock market rebound, which would be helped by rate cuts.''
These are the ''temps'' that employers have increasingly used.
''Temps are the first to go in a slowing economy,'' said Thomas Nardone, chief of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the employment reports.

Until last month, the suffering in manufacturing and temporary help had been more than offset by employment increases in retailing, wholesale trade, transportation, public utilities, engineering services, consulting and government.
One of the few remaining sources of strength was construction, which swings widely.

It is still possible that March might be an exception and April will produce a rosier employment report.
But few economists embrace this view.
Even Mr. Varvares is cautious.
Financial services stood out in March as reasonably strong, adding 17,000 jobs, many of them in mortgage lending, where falling interest rates have encouraged people to refinance mortgages or borrow to purchase new homes.
Beyond the overall job loss, there were other indications in the March report that a slowing economy was approaching a recession.
Job growth has steadily declined, from an average of 244,000 a month in last year's first quarter to 70,000 in the fourth quarter and 64,000 in the just-ended first quarter.
Among the unemployed, the share of those laid off versus those who resign has risen gradually, to 48.8 percent, and the share of those unemployed for more than five weeks has also risen.
Blacks are suffering the most from rising unemployment.
''This is inertia, a delayed response to the very tight labor markets that are now easing up,'' said Joshua N. Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.
Viewed from another angle, the rising hours were foreboding.
Less efficiency means higher costs, which must be offset by either higher prices or lower profits -- probably the latter, in Mr. Feinman's view.
''That is not good for the stock market,'' he said.
That tale of two apartments might serve as a parable for the state of New York City's residential real estate market -- stark reality setting in at dizzying heights after a disputed presidential election, stock market gyrations, dot-com layoffs, faltering earnings for big-name national firms.

But nothing in New York is formulaic.
And while sales volume slipped in 2000, the buzz of rising prices is still being heard so far this year -- muted, perhaps, to a hum as some buyers assume a wait-and-see posture.
All five boroughs -- with Manhattan again stretching the imaginings of profitability -- saw prices increase in 2000, according to realtors' figures.
And in the rejuvenating Bronx, where last year's $236,000 average price was 4.9 percent higher than the average of $225,000 in 1999, according to one broker's calculations.
By another market gauge, the repeat-sale survey conducted by Case Shiller Weiss, the home-price research company, last year, for the second straight year, every ZIP code area in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island (the survey does not cover Manhattan) experienced price appreciation: 12 areas by up to 4 percent, 20 by 4 to 8 percent, 49 by 8 to 12 percent and another 49 -- including swaths in each of those boroughs -- by at least 12 percent.
And then there's Manhattan.
It is not by some inherent hubris that New York City, even in a time of national uncertainty, defies laws of economic gravity.
It is more a function of specific local factors maintaining upward pressure on prices.
The city and the metropolitan region are, to a degree and for a time, at least, insulated from a national economic downturn, largely because they are less dependent on manufacturing.
At the same time, the city is virtually landlocked, one reason that despite a healthy spike in housing construction last year, supply remains limited.
Add into the mix a population that broke the near-mythic eight million mark, according to the 2000 census, including a rainbow-stream of recent immigrants; near-record low mortgage interest rates, citywide job growth, rising per capita income levels and record year-end bonus payouts in the financial markets, and the Big Apple's real estate market continues to be squeezed -- with sellers savoring the sauce.

''This year looks to me like it's going to shape up as a pretty good year for housing,'' said Rae Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
''The market is no longer roiling; it's settled down to a simmer.''
The city received $6 billion in venture capital investment in 2000, Ms. Rosen said, referring to ''people investing in private companies that are still fairly young and may be a year or two away from an initial public offering.''
All indicative of a healthy job market.
The city added 83,000 private-sector jobs in 2000, raising private employment from 3,161,400 to 3,244,600.
Ms. Rosen said, ''These figures indicate a fairly strong economy to me.''
And they point to people's ability to make down payments -- especially when mortgage rates are low.
Icing on the city's current housing cake, particularly the high-rise luxury slice, was another record year for Wall Street bonuses.

Lots of money, but not much to buy.
The city's population hit 8,008,278 a year ago, according to the 2000 census, growing by 685,000 over the last 10 years.
''Unless we promote construction to meet this demand, housing prices in New York are likely to keep rising,'' he added.
And so for now, at least, despite the nation's economic jitters and recent evidence of local buyer hesitation, there has been little easing of the price squeeze from one neighborhood to the next in the five boroughs.
That long-unsold penthouse in Brooklyn Heights, Mr. Thomas of the William B.
Recalling one couple's shift from intending to buy in the Heights to paying the full asking price of $950,000 for ''a brownstone that needed work on a prime Fort Greene block,'' Mr. Thomas said that, soon after, another house one block away came on the market, also at $950,000.
''The point is that prior to this in Fort Greene, properties were priced based on previous sales.

There seems to be little hesitation to fork over top dollar at the rarefied heights of the Manhattan market.
Divining real estate trends by the numbers is, at best, a murky exercise.
To begin with, co-op sales are not officially recorded because, technically, they are securities transactions involving the selling of shares, not transfers of title.
Condominium sales, however, are officially recorded.
As a result, studies of co-op data compiled by brokerage houses and appraisal concerns do not claim to include all transactions in the market, and can vary in their findings.
At the same time, some market surveys report average prices, while others use a median -- meaning half the prices are above that figure and half below.
Still, the numbers, along with anecdotal impressions, can serve as barometers of market patterns.

For two-bedroom units, the median was $595,000 in 1999 and $775,000 in 2000, a hefty 30.3 percent jump.
''So far this year,'' said Mr. Miller, ''there's been a modest rise, a subtle uptick.''

''People have been second-guessing what's to come,'' said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, one of Manhattan's largest brokerage firms.
''The difference between last year and now is not that apartments are cheaper, but that buyers are disappointed because they thought they would see prices come down by now.''
Manhattan
Prices Are Leaping All Over the Borough
The Real Estate Board of New York offered a site-specific assessment of the Manhattan market.
''On the West Side, the increases are also remarkable,'' Ms. Beck said.
''Postwar, it was $390,000 in '99, rising 26.6 percent to $494,000 in 2000.''
The postwar price downtown was $288,000 in '99, rising to $320,000 in 2000, up 11.1 percent.
R. Kenyatta Punter, president of the Greater Harlem Board of Realtors, welcomes some price moderation.
''Sort of like the higher you go, the harder you fall,'' he said.
''We don't want prices to go like dot-coms and decline by 40 percent.''
Citing an 1898 Victorian brownstone -- ''five bedrooms, three full baths, original woodwork, six gas fireplaces on 20-by-55 lot'' -- in Harlem's Hamilton Heights Historic District, Mr. Punter said it had listed in November for $1.1 million and is currently under contract at $775,000.
''I think it marks a shift in the marketplace,'' he said.
''Things are starting to calm down.
And I think it's healthy for the community, because values should not rise indiscriminately.
Harlem is a community that is revitalizing, and in order for any community to flourish you need a proper economic and demographic mix.''
Brooklyn
Beyond Brownstones, 'Realty Homes' Rise
There are three Brooklyn realtor groups that specialize in house-price data beyond that northwestern section commonly called ''brownstone Brooklyn.''
And, as their names imply, they are fairly geographically specific: the South Shore, Mid-Island and Bay Ridge-Bensonhurst Multiple Listing Services.
According to the Bay Ridge-Bensonhurst service, the average price for one- to four-family homes in those communities was $360,454 last year, a 12.3 percent jump from $320,976 in 1999.
And in the Mid-County area -- a band across the middle of the borough that includes, among other communities, Borough Park, Flatbush and East New York -- the average in 2000 was $238,388, up 10 percent from the 1999 average of $216,776.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The pattern of price appreciation was also evident in the Case Shiller Weiss survey.
The survey is based on an index showing the average price for all single-family homes sold, ZIP code by ZIP code in areas for which it has sufficient information, year by year.
Of the 36 ZIP codes in Brooklyn, 2 saw prices rise by 4 to 8 percent last year, 8 by 8 to 12 percent, and 26 by 12 percent or more.
Mr. Longo, who is also president of the Madison Estates brokerage firm in Marine Park, said Brooklyn ''experienced a bit of flatlining during December and part of January, but that dramatically changed when we saw the drop in mortgage rates'' -- after two half-point cuts in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in January, and not counting another half-point cut 17 days ago.
Sales-volume data for the three Brooklyn listing services does show a 7.4 percent slippage, from 8,813 transactions in 1999 to 8,162 last year.
''In Marine Park,'' he said, ''we have what we call realty homes; they carry the name of the development or the developer from 60-plus years ago.''
They are, generally, semidetached, two- or three-bedroom, 14-foot-wide, 34-foot-long houses on 20-by-100 lots.
''Over the years, people have completely updated them,'' Mr. Longo said.
''We find them going in the neighborhood of $230,000, $240,000.
It's amazing because these same homes only three years ago were going for $150,000 to $170,000.''
Queens
Buyers Shrug Off Stock Gyrations
Of the 57 ZIP code areas in Queens, according to the Case Shiller survey, 12 saw prices appreciate by up to 4 percent last year, 18 by 4 to 8 percent, 23 by 8 to 12 percent and 4 by 12 percent or more.
''We still have low inventory, so prices haven't softened,'' said Barbara Frechter, president of Glenjay Realty in Forest Hills and a former president of the Long Island Board of Realtors, which includes Queens.
''The stock market thing does not affect the co-op people here, or the people buying a house at $300,000 to $350,000, the way it does the heavy rollers in Manhattan,'' she said.
''There are houses in Forest Hills Gardens that are a million and better,'' she said.
''But for a one-bedroom co-op on Queens Boulevard, I'd say anywhere from $75,000 to $125,000.
And, of course, we have luxury condos -- $300,000 for a two-bedroom.''
The Bronx
Manhattan Migrants Find Prices Attractive
The Bronx Board of Realtors does not compile complete statistics.
And in more western environs, including Riverdale, the average for single-family homes jumped 19.6 percent, from $321,000 to $384,000.
Susan Goldy, president of the Riverdale brokerage firm that bears her name, said, ''We're still getting people from Manhattan who can't afford there, and know they can qualitatively buy into much more here.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
For example, Ms. Goldy said: ''There's a gracious stucco 1920 Mediterranean; archways, thick walls; four bedrooms, balconies, listed at $1,350,000.
We're not getting bids above asking, but there's a lot of interest.''
Two-bedroom co-ops in the community ''are basically running from $140,000 -- that would really be on the low side -- to maybe $335,000.''
Staten Island
Despite Concerns, A Need for Housing
On Staten Island, according to Sandy Krueger, executive vice president of the borough's Board of Realtors, the average price for existing single-family homes in 2000 was $227,396, a 12.3 percent increase over $202,422 in 1999.
Of Staten Island's 12 ZIP code areas, according to the Case Shiller survey of single-family homes, 7 saw prices increase by 8 to 12 percent and 5 jumped by at least 12 percent.
''People are concerned,'' she said, ''but there's still that need for housing.''
But why should one worry about this development?
It is not serious as long as the debt is small and remains under control so as not to worry creditors.
But if the debt is not under control, or if some event makes the debtor appear less creditworthy than before, the creditors may decide that they are not willing to finance a country's growing debt -- for fear of a depreciation of the debtor's currency that lowers asset values in their own currencies.
They may even want to liquidate part of their investment in search of diversification.
If such a thing happened to the United States, there could be very unpleasant consequences for Americans.

Depreciation of the dollar would make imports so expensive and exports so cheap as to eliminate the trade deficit.
But this depreciation would create a further motive for foreigners to liquidate their American assets, dumping the dollars so obtained in exchange for foreign currency.
The size and power of the American economy has protected us from capital flight in shorter episodes of unfavorable trade balance, but there is no guarantee that this will remain true.
Nor could the dollar be propped up through purchases by the Federal Reserve or the Treasury, since their small reserves of foreign currency would be woefully inadequate to stem the tide.
(The United States reserves amount to some $60 billion compared with a current trade deficit of $400 billion a year, just two months' borrowing.)
Thus a flight from the dollar would produce a deep devaluation and accompanying rise in the prices of imports and of things made with imports.
At worst we might experience a wage and price spiral, calling for sharply higher interest rates.
The final result could be falling investment and output, and high unemployment.
And our weakness would be very likely to spread to other countries.
Few believe that this hard-landing scenario is an immediate threat.
But there is good reason to believe that if nothing is done to change the current course, the probability of a costly ending will keep increasing.
To avoid that danger, the administration and Congress should develop a plan that promptly stops the growth of the trade deficit, then reduces it to zero and possibly produces a positive balance, allowing for some repayment -- and all this without an appreciable increase in unemployment.

The success of such a plan would rest on two main ingredients: a gradual reduction of total domestic expenditure relative to income -- that is, a rise in national saving -- and an increase in net exports.
These two components should proceed hand in hand; indeed, given the current level of demand for domestically produced goods and services, if we added to it by shifting more of our output to exports prematurely, the result would be inflationary pressures.
Conversely, a reduction of domestic demand would have to be ountered by an expansion of net exports to avoid creating a contraction in output and employment.
Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the administration and Congress are concerned with the balance of trade issue or are even aware of it.
On the contrary, President Bush is galloping in exactly the wrong direction with his advocacy of using the likely (though by no means certain) large forthcoming budget surplus for a deep, permanent tax cut, rather than for retiring the debt or endowing Social Security -- or both.
The president's proposal is just the opposite of the needed increase in national saving, and the consequences would be very negative.
First, it would raise consumption by roughly one dollar for every dollar of tax reduction -- which is precisely what the supporters of the bill claim to be its justification.
But, given the limitations on our labor force and our abiity to produce, the rise in consumption would sooner or later produce some combination of the following unhealthy outcomes: significant inflationary pressures, in part undoing the tax rebate; a likely rise in interest rates to counter the inflation, leading to a reduction in investment; and a further increase in the trade deficit.
Can anyone really favor encouraging a further expansion of the recent spending spree at the expense of investment, the source of future growth?
Or reducing taxes at the expense of a sharp addition to future taxes, required to service a much larger debt at higher interest rates?
Or supporting a tax cut financed with money borrowed abroad, even in the favorable case in which foreign lenders would be prepared to finance a rapidly growing debt?
If Congress is acting responsibly, the least it can do is to postpone a deep permanent tax cut until this trade balance has turned positive.
But, some tax-cut proponents will argue, what if right now there is a clear danger of a significant economic contraction?
If this were clearly the case -- and it is still in doubt -- then some measure to support demand might be appropriate.
But the best approach would be to expand net exports, helping both domestic demand and the trade balance -- perhaps by aiming at a controlled, limited devaluation of the dollar and by encouraging other countries, like Europe, to pursue more expansionary policies in their own interest.
It may even be justifiable to consider a modest, temporary tax cut, but with a warning that theory and evidence suggest that transitory tax cuts are likely to produce only limited, quick effects.
The 1988 fires burned with an unparalleled ferocity, fed on fuel that had accumulated under a century-long policy, abandoned in the 1970's, of suppressing fires.
An unusual series of nine fronts passed over, bringing high winds and lightning but no moisture.

Videos show the forest was so dry that mature trees burned completely in 15 to 20 seconds.
The short lesson, says John Varley, director of the Yellowstone Center for Research, is this: ''Mother Nature does not destroy herself.
It's that simple.
Instead it is a giant reapportionment of species.''
The shifts in habitat fall along a spectrum, from major to subtle, depending on factors including the fire's intensity of the burn and the soil conditions.
The changes favor some species and increase their distribution and abundance, while hampering others, sometimes for the short term, and sometimes for much longer.
Park researchers detail these effects in a new 118-page book, ''Yellowstone in the Afterglow: Lessons From the Fire.''
While the effects of fire vary in different ecosystems, some general principles apply.
Depending on wind and available fuel, a wildfire burns in a mosaic, destroying some areas, while singeing other areas and leaving some untouched.
These ''patch dynamics'' are critical to recovery.
Lightly burned or unburned areas provide a reservoir of seeds that revitalize more heavily burned acreage.
Immediately after the 1988 fires, grasses and forbs, which burn on top but regenerate from roots below ground, surged back, stimulated by nitrogen and phosphorous loosed from dead plants.
''It's been a remarkably rapid regrowth,'' said Dr. Bill Romme, a fire ecologist at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., who has studied park fires for 25 years.
A return of the forests, predominantly lodgepole pine in Yellowstone, takes far longer.
Stands of spindly black trees that look like burned matches still sprawl over vast acreage.
Over the years many have been toppled by the wind.
But some remain standing for decades, and their roots continue to hold the soil and moderate the climate as a new generation rises beneath them.
Meanwhile, new pines are anywhere from knee high to 15 feet, depending on soil and moisture.
Lodgepole pine cones wrap the seeds for a new generation in a waxy coating, and the wax is melted and seed released only when the temperature reaches 113 degrees.

In areas that burned last year, at lower elevations than the park, much more of the forests were in drier ecosystems that are less resilient.
In the Bitterroot Valley in southwest Montana, for example, 25 percent of the forest is ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, and they take much longer to regenerate.
Rather than being released from the trees that are burned, the seeds are produced by neighboring trees, and not every year.
Regeneration happens fastest from bumper crops of cones -- called pulse events -- and when they will occur is unpredictable.
''The seed gradually makes its way in with gravity and wind,'' said Glenda Scott, a forester with the United States Forest Service in Missoula, Mont., and a specialist in reforestation.
''It takes from 8 to 15 years.
In areas that won't naturally regenerate, we'll plant trees.''
But in burned areas, the fires are expected to give rise to a wider variety of different aged stands, and with them a greater variety of habitats.
They feed in old growth in the winter, eating the new growth of fir and spruce.
Pine martens suffered as well, for they favor tunnels created by deadfall and snow in old growth forests to hide from predators and stalk prey.

Nesting birds, including those who make their homes in the cavities of trees, flourish immediately and in the first few decades after a fire.
Boring beetles and other insects feast on dead trees, then become the feast as woodpeckers, mountain bluebirds and tree swallows swarm to burned areas.
These and other nesting birds will thrive until the canopy begins to close again.
One Yellowstone fire study in the 1960's showed that 29 years after a fire, there were 72 breeding pairs of nesting birds per 100 acres.
Large numbers of toppling dead trees alter species composition on the forest floor as well, providing cover for snowshoe hare, voles and deer mice, a fully stocked grocery for a variety of predators.
Biologists expect to see an increase in the number of lynx, for example, which feed on hare.
It has been difficult to measure the effects of the fire on the park's ''charismatic megafauna'' -- grizzly bears, bison and elk.
The northern herd is now about 14,000, substantially less than the peak of 20,000 before the fire.
However, said Dr. Wayne Minshall, a professor of ecology at Idaho State University, who has studied streams for 35 years, ''Two to 15 years after the fire, conditions recover and often get better than they were before the fire.''
Right after a fire, ash, burned trees and mud flow create a deadly slurry that flows into a stream and can kill fish, move channels and widen the stream by a factor of 10 to 100 times.
After this pulse of burned material has washed out, the stream starts to recover and often becomes more heterogeneous.
With the canopy gone, sunlight causes algae to grow, which feeds insects.
More woody debris in the stream increases pools where fish can spawn.
Nutrients unlocked by the fire stimulate the growth of riparian vegetation, which improves insect habitat and food.
As the size and number of insects increase, so do the size and number of fish.
Yellowstone Park has a natural regulation policy that allows nature, no matter the consequences, to take its course.
That should be a guide for people outside the park who would like to hasten restoration of fire-ravaged rivers and streams, Dr. Minshall said.
''The worst is salvage logging.
Roading intercepts the flow of water, roads blow out and wash into the stream, and wood is important over 20 years as it washes into the stream.''
The Yellowstone report suggests that one of the major complications after last year's fires throughout the West will be dealing with exotic species like spotted knapweed or dalmatian toadflax, an escaped ornamental.
Some already exist and capitalize on the burned areas, while others have been brought in on the tires of firefighting equipment from other areas.
They are minimal in places like Yellowstone, where the landscape is undisturbed, but pose serious problems on disturbed ground that has burned.
''These aggressive exotics push out the native plant communities,'' said Jim Olivarez, a noxious weed program leader for the Forest Service.
''They can push out elk because what they prefer isn't there and cause erosion because they have a different root structure.''
The variety of ecosystems burned last year will respond in different ways, Dr. Romme said.
Ponderosa pine forests at low elevations evolved with frequent low intensity fire, and the very hot fires may have destroyed pine cones in the fires near Los Alamos, N.M., and parts of Montana.
It may take a long time for seeds to blow in.

At Mesa Verde, Colo., where intense fires burned, Gamble oak forests sprout new trees from the roots of old ones.
They have done well.
On the other hand, pygmy woodlands in the same area, with pinyon and juniper trees, burned in the drought last year and are not fire adapted.
They are being invaded by exotic weeds, and their fate hangs in the balance.
While fuel loading from a century of fire suppression is a serious problem in the West, some experts think something else is at the root of catastrophic fires.
''The climate is getting warmer and drier and more extreme,'' said Mr. Varley, the director of the Yellowstone research center.
Now it's 38 degrees.
That doesn't sound like much, but it causes big changes ecologically.''
Whatever the case, Yellowstone has played a critical role in demonstrating the changes brought by fires.
And it isn't over: land managers are still going to school on the Yellowstone experience.
''The lessons of '88 in the park are like classic Led Zeppelin,'' said Mr. Renkin, a park ecologist.
''They'll be around forever.''

MANHATTAN: COUNCIL CRITICIZES OTB SALE
The Giuliani administration should not proceed with the planned sale of the city's Off-Track Betting Corporation unless it protects the jobs of nearly 2,000 city workers, revises the way horse-racing wagers are divided to make the New York racing industry more competitive, and takes steps to ensure that city youths cannot illegally use televised races to bet at home, a City Council report issued yesterday said.
The Giuliani administration plans to select a winning bidder for the 68 off-track parlors before the end of this month, a sale that it has said will raise at least $250 million initially and generate annual follow-up payments.

MANHATTAN: UNION CARDS AT YELLOW PAGES
The American Arbitration Association has certified that 520 Yellow Pages employees throughout New York State should become members of the Communications Workers of America after about 70 percent of those workers signed cards saying they wanted to unionize.
These employees work for Verizon Information Services in New York and nine other cities.

ASBURY PARK: SUPERMARKET UNIONS SET STRIKE VOTE
About 28,000 workers at four supermarket chains -- Foodtown, Pathmark, ShopRite and Stop & Shop -- will vote this week on whether to authorize a strike.
The United Food and Commercial Workers Union and the supermarkets, which are negotiating as a group, are bargaining in the hope of averting a strike when the contract expires at 12:01 a.m. Sunday.
The main issue in the talks is wages.
Full-time workers in New Jersey earn an average of $16.91 an hour, while part-time workers average $8.53.

Semiconductor stocks, widely seen as the leading indicator of a recovery in the broader technology market, led the advance yesterday.
The shares rallied after an analyst from Salomon Smith Barney issued a report recommending the group, saying business is likely to pick up later this year.
Since last Thursday, the Nasdaq index has risen 16 percent.
Even with the gain, it remains 62 percent below the peak reached in March 2000.
''I am not sure this is the beginning of a straight move to the upside,'' said Philip S. Dow, managing director of equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis.
''My guess is we are in a backing and filling, grinding mode.
The watchword I am looking for from my analysts is that things are not getting worse.''
Declines in Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson and Merck more than offset gains in Intel, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup.

''We have been telling clients to avoid safe, defensive-type stocks, because we think the market has bottomed,'' he said.

''We're decelerating very quickly,'' said Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
''There really isn't much, if any momentum.''
In fact, consumers have grown more worried this month about the nation's economic health, according to a preliminary survey released by the University of Michigan.
Since late last year, though, people have also become concerned about the present, and most of this month's declining optimism reflected worries about the economy today.
The preliminary April confidence index, which is based on a telephone survey of about 300 people, was 87.8, down from a reading of 91.5 in March and 108.3 in July 2000.
The University of Michigan will release a final result for April once it completes 200 additional interviews, recalculating the index based on their responses.

''All of this leads me to the conclusion that we're going to have very slow growth in consumer spending over the next year,'' Mr. Curtin said.
As the economy has slowed, people have also become less confident in government officials and in the Federal Reserve.
Still, most economists continue to predict moderate growth for the rest of the year, although some say a recession is inevitable.
The optimists note that the job market, consumer confidence and retail sales all remain stronger than they have in other recent slumps, even if the measures have weakened in the last six months.

''Countercyclical way'' is the D word in other clothes.
That is as close as politicians have gotten, so far, to praising deficits.
But their allies in the economics profession are beginning to make the case for them -- preaching the curative powers of a shrinking budget surplus, even one that crosses the line into deficit.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Listen, for example, to John H. Makin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington that is very supportive of the Bush administration.
''Wake up, folks,'' Mr. Makin said, ''If we are going to have a weak economy, we are going to have to think about deficit spending.''
More cautiously, Robert M. Solow, a Democrat, offers the same observation.
He is a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was an adviser to President Kennedy in the 1960's, when tax cuts came into their heyday as a fiscal stimulus -- the idea being that people would spend the windfall, helping to revive a failing economy.
''In a recession, the budget surplus diminishes automatically, and this is not a bad thing,'' Mr. Solow said.
''If you can do it quickly, you might even want short-run tax reduction to beef up aggregate spending, even if that means a dip into deficit.''
There's that dreaded word again.
Deficit spending is an old concept, formulated by John Maynard Keynes and favored until the 1980's as a standard tool for regulating the economy.
The theory is straightforward.
Surpluses hold back the economy.
They represent money that people would have spent if the money had not been taken from them in taxes and then put on the shelf by the government.
Deficits, on the other hand, are expansionary.
The government spends tax money on all sorts of services and projects -- and then borrows more and spends that, too, to keep the economy humming.
Or else the money is returned to taxpayers through tax cuts, and they spend it.
These days, when so many politicians rail against big government, a tax cut, rather than public spending, has become the favored form of fiscal stimulus.
With deficits re-emerging as acceptable policy, a tax cut seems more likely than ever as a means to revive the economy.
What is still unresolved is the timing of the cut, its size and who gets it.
Mr. Solow, for example, has signed a petition calling for a ''sizable'' one-time rebate that would go out this summer in tens of millions of checks mailed to taxpayers.
The Bush administration's tax cut would be much larger, and permanent, which would promote consumer spending, Republicans argue.
But critics say the Bush proposal would fail as stimulus because the tax cut would be spread over too many years and would put too much money into the hands of the wealthy, who are considered the least likely to spend it.

Whatever the pros and cons, some in the old Clinton camp still keep the faith.
Lawrence H. Summers, who was President Clinton's last treasury secretary, insists that budget surpluses work.
''The old idea that deficits are stimulative was good economics in the 1930's and probably in the 1960's,'' he said, but not in today's world, where ''interest rates are largely determined by the long-term bond market.''
The bond market, he argues, responds favorably to surpluses by lowering interest rates, which in turn encourages people to borrow and spend.
Other economists from the Clinton administration have a more complex view of the 1990's.
Alan S. Blinder of Princeton and Janet L. Yellen at the University of California at Berkeley tell a more complicated story in a forthcoming research paper financed by the Russell Sage Foundation and the Century Foundation.
The budget surplus was indeed expansionary in the mid-1990's, they write, but only because of special, fortuitous circumstances.
Throw into this mix the Federal Reserve's help in holding down interest rates, the wealth-creation from a rising stock market and the public's manic borrowing and spending.
Or, as Mr. Blinder put it: ''To get a 'contractionary' fiscal policy to be expansionary, the stars have to be in alignment.''
For Mr. Makin, a modest deficit -- say $200 billion a year -- is insignificant in a nearly $10 trillion economy and can be carried indefinitely.
Through most of its history, in fact, the government's budget has been in deficit.
But Mr. Solow, Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen argue that over the long run, a surplus is necessary to pay for baby boomers' retirement, among other looming needs.
So Keynesian theory has reasserted itself: deficits are O.K.
in the short run in a downturn.
The economists are convinced.
The politicians probably are, too.
And the public?
Well, deficits never sat well with the public, and after years of being told that surpluses are wonderful, a rewrite of that message may not fly.
''We have never had an intelligent political debate over deficits and surpluses, going back to Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930's,'' said David C. Colander, an economics historian at Middlebury College.
Sir Peter is, by his own confession, dedicated to Shakespeare's language: the disciplined delivery of its poetics.
He has said as well that he approaches a production without an overall concept and lets the rehearsal process and the actors determine the show's tone and direction.
It is an idealistic approach that expresses utter confidence in the theater's collaborative creative process.
But in this case it has generated a sluggish, unilluminating production of a play that begs for the kind of momentum and clarity that a propulsive directorial hand can provide.

Performed here in the round, on a stage turned into a sandbox, the play opens with its most stirring imagery: two skeletons swathed in rags and propped against each other as if rotting after a beach picnic, and two others in a stark, coital embrace, a chilling depiction of Shakespeare's bile-filled connection between lust and battle.
But it is merely an admonitory prologue.
The skeletons are swept off by the grimy Thersites (Andrew Weems), and the stage is left clear for the static gatherings and the verbal proclamations and manipulations that hold sway in each of the opposing military camps.
In spite of a relentless parade of entrances and exits and a couple of gymnastic fight scenes toward the end, the production is thick-limbed and trudging; it never burrows from under the self-deluding and often overwrought bloviations of characters for whom self-importance knows no bounds.
It is both Shakespeare's genius and Shakespeare's joke that they express themselves with some of the knottiest verbiage in any of his plays: ''Princes,'' begins Agamemnon, addressing his high command in an attempt to rouse their flagging enthusiasm for the war,
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?

Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
It's the kind of writing that winks at its own erudition and almost willfully obscures the plot, which can be summarized this way:
Troilus and Cressida, mutual admirers from afar, are brought together by Pandarus, Cressida's uncle, a half-Cupid, half-pimp who encourages their sexual union.
None are aware, however, that Cressida's father, Calchas, who has defected to the Greeks, has arranged for his daughter to be given to the Greek officer Diomedes in exchange for a captured Trojan.
In the meantime the Greeks are particularly fed up with their indolent and scornful warrior, Achilles, whose sexually diverse predilections seem to lay foremost claim to his loyalty.
So the other officers agree to a plan devised by the clever and officious Ulysses, meant to lure Achilles back to battle by lionizing instead an inferior man, Ajax.
The Trojans, meanwhile, are clearly irritated that years of bloody torment and deprivation have resulted from the capture of Helen, and the question is on the table: Is Paris's lust for a trollopy beauty really an appropriate symbol of the pride of Ilium, worth defending at all costs?
As Hector declares at one point, ''Let Helen go.''
In the end, all weaknesses are indulged and promises broken, naturally to gruesome effect: heartbreak, death, the ruination of Troy, the blackened soul of Greece.
Sir Peter's essentially laissez-faire staging leaves the actors to create the peaks and valleys of drama, but this is an ensemble that remains unbonded and uncohesive, and though most in the large cast cope reasonably with Shakespearean poetics, few manage to act distinctively as well.
(The costumes don't help; the Greeks in particular look like some shabby medieval motorcycle gang.)
Idris Elba, as Achilles, with an ever-present wine goblet in his hand and a controlling arm often around his doting companion, Patroclus, does have the swagger to convey both his physical prowess and his graceless egomania.
And Terence Rigby, as Agamemnon, does a subtle turn as a commander who is sick of his job, leading by spiritless habit.
Mr. Weems's Thersites is pugnacious and bravely unpleasant, though he's not the most gleeful or humorous name-caller.

The encampment, the North Pole Environmental Observatory, run by scientists from the University of Washington, was, of necessity, temporary, because the ice cap is always moving.
The project is being watched by many oceanographers and climate scientists hungry for fresh data from that end of the earth.
''We know very little about the rhythms up there,'' said Dr. Richard B.
Alley, an expert on the age-old cycles of glaciers and sea ice and a professor of earth sciences at Penn State.
Collecting basic data on salinity, ice thickness, temperature and the like is crucial, he said, because only with such sustained monitoring can trends and their causes be spotted.
The work is also expected to help computer scientists fine-tune models that simulate global climate.
Despite substantial progress, the models only roughly approximate the matrix of interactions by the ocean, atmosphere and ice that shapes conditions in northern latitudes.
''Of all the places in the world where we're seeing big changes in climate over the past couple of decades, these are the most dramatic,'' said Dr. John Michael Wallace, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington, who is not directly involved in the project.

Much of the research involves ice.
Because it reflects sunlight and thus helps make a cold place even colder, widespread melting of arctic ice could accelerate a warming trend.
''Permanent summertime melting of the whole Arctic could happen in a few decades if trends of the last 20 years continue,'' Dr. Wallace said.
On the other hand, the recent ice retreat ''could be a short-term flip.''
Other scientists have challenged the data pointing to a sharp thinning of the ice cap recently, and some contend that the shrinking of the ice-covered area at the pole has been a trend for a century or more, not a new anomaly.
It is all the more important, then, many scientists say, to solve this polar puzzle.
But seeking the necessary clues is about the closest science gets to an extreme sport.
The quest to reach and comprehend the nature of the North Pole has claimed dozens of lives, from causes including starvation, freezing, carbon monoxide asphyxiation of crews shivering over coal ovens in icebound ships and even poisoning of a captain by a mutinous crew.
In much of the 20th century, the Soviet Union took the lead, maintaining a series of research stations on the polar ice from the 1940's until 1991.
The research ended with the economic collapse after the fall of communism.
Soviet data, released over the last few years, have provided a valuable, although limited, window on earlier decades, said Dr. James H. Morison, the University of Washington oceanographer directing the new polar project.
More recent research efforts have probed the region, some by icebreaker or Navy submarine.
But good data are scattered and hard to come by.

Unlike other regions, which offer scientists evidence in tree rings, ancient glacial ice or layers of sediment from seasonal plankton, the pole is largely bereft of clues to its climates past.
The nearest glaciers, in Greenland, reflect mainly conditions in the Atlantic.
The clues that do exist are tantalizingly vague.
But there is no way to tell the age of the marks.

The new polar team of scientists from several American universities and a Japanese marine research center established a base camp on April 2 less than 30 miles from the geographic pole.
Intense solar storms interrupted radio communications, meaning that planes taking off for the three-hour flight to the pole had no word on the conditions awaiting them.
Unlike similar research stations at the South Pole, where an underlying continent has allowed countries to build sophisticated science villages, the Arctic encampment had to be built on a river of ice that rises off the Siberian coast, then grinds its way through the Fram Strait east of Greenland.
As a result, the station itself was on the move, shifting up to several miles a day as the polar ice, pushed by winds and currents, slowly drifted over the point at which the world turns.
Even in early spring, the ice, which is usually 10 feet thick or thicker, provides an uncertain foundation.
If all goes as planned, the technology left behind on and beneath the ice -- including compact, rugged, computer-controlled instruments similar to space probes -- will create the first continuous profile of changes in the air, ice and ocean depths at the pole itself.
The centerpiece of the project is the four-ton chain of instruments anchored to the sea floor.
Held aloft by glass fishing-net floats, the chain reaches up like a giant synthetic kelp frond.
At the top, just 150 feet or so below the ice, is an upward-focused sonar device designed to keep a yearlong record of the thickness of the ice drifting overhead.

From there down to the sea floor, more than a dozen instruments will track currents, salinity, temperature, and other conditions at various depths.
Next year, an acoustical signal from above will release the cable from its base and send it floating up under the ice, said Dr. Richard E. Moritz, the University of Washington oceanographer whose prime focus is the ice-measuring sonar.
The cable also has a beacon like those some skiers wear in case they are buried in an avalanche.
From the ice or an icebreaker, the scientists will home in on the signal.
The recovery team will include at least two divers, in case the cable is snarled on one of the jumbled submerged ice ridges that crisscross the ice cap.
Then the plan is to repeat the drill, resetting the underwater instrument chain for two more years.
''It's a gamble,'' said Dr. Moritz, adding that there are a dozen ways the project could fail.
But answers to many key questions lie beneath the ice, and so the risky effort proceeds.
A central challenge is to track changes in the sharply defined layers of ocean water under the ice.
Water in the top 100 yards or so, fed by four rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean and by melting ice, tends to be relatively fresh and frigid.
Under it is much warmer, saltier water that flows into the Arctic Ocean from the Atlantic, in one of the ocean's endless conveyer belts that move heat from the Equator.
This influx of Atlantic water appears to have grown and warmed sharply in recent years, the scientists say.
And a thin layer of water of intermediate temperature and salinity that normally lies between the cold, fresh surface and the warm, salty depths vanished in the 1990's, said Dr. Douglas G. Martinson, an oceanographer at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
In theory, this has allowed more heat from the deep Atlantic water to reach the ice, accelerating its melting.
Dr. Martinson said expectations for the new research should be tempered because even a five-year study is only nibbling at the edges of environmental phenomena that could have cycles of decades or centuries.
''This work is unlikely to give you the answer you want,'' said Dr. Alley, at Penn State.
''But it's work that has to happen to get to the answer you want.''
Now that the researchers have flown home, only the automated probes remain, steadily recording
Stocks may rise spectacularly after interest rate cuts, but lower borrowing costs have always needed months, or even a year, to affect people's decisions about most big purchases.
Because of this delay, these economists say, the economy will continue to become weaker before it can recover.

In the process, the longest economic expansion in American history would end.
''It is too late to prevent a recession,'' said Anirvan Banerji, the director of research at the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York.
''The process that leads to job losses is already in motion.''
Mr. Banerji and other analysts who follow leading economic indicators, like new factory orders and the number of people applying for unemployment benefits, say that such numbers, taken together, have never reached their current levels without a recession following.
Optimists counter that unusually low inflation has given the Fed great flexibility to reduce interest rates without worrying that consumers and businesses would then embark on a spending binge that would cause prices to spiral upward.
With interest rates falling, most economists say, consumers will buy houses, cars and other goods at a healthy pace, as they have continued to do for most of the last year.
Businesses, for their part, will become more willing to invest in new equipment and to hire new workers as they try to sell the products now lingering on warehouse shelves.
''This is a classic inventory cycle,'' said Neal M. Soss, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, who believes the economy will grow by about 1 percent in the first half of the year and about 3 percent in the second half.
The main difference in this slowdown from previous ones, Dr. Soss added, is that businesses and the Fed have both reacted more quickly, ensuring a sharper but shorter adjustment period.
Many economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output by the nation as a whole.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of academics considered to be the official arbiter of business cycles, is less specific, but it says most recessions last six months to a year.
The debate is more than a semantic one because an actual recession would almost surely cause significantly more job losses and stock market declines than a slowdown would.
A similar version of the economists' debate is also playing out across the country -- albeit less explicitly -- as people decide whether to sell some of their stocks, buy a new house or commit to a summer vacation.
They will ultimately affect the debate's outcome, too.

So far, Americans have reflected the divide among economists by saying one thing and doing another.
People have become far less confident about the economy since late last year, according to polls, but they have continued to buy goods at a fairly brisk pace in the first three months of 2001.
Even as the stock market has fallen, consumers have taken on more debt.
This must change soon, economists agree.
Either confidence will begin to recover or spending will start falling.
The pessimists think the adjustment has already begun.
Few analysts expect the unemployment rate to fall soon.
This year, Cisco Systems, Eastman Kodak and dozens of other companies have announced layoffs, most of which are taking effect over weeks or months.
Altogether, employment statistics that suggest future trends -- like the number of hours worked and other measures -- have dropped to their lowest level in 19 years, according to the Economic Cycle Research Institute.
Despite the increased popularity of investing in stocks, relatively few Americans rely on them for a significant portion of their income.
Widespread job cuts, on the other hand, are almost guaranteed to crimp consumer spending, one of the few strengths of the American economy so far this year.

With layoffs already under way, the economy is doomed to weaken further, say those who believe a recession to be unavoidable.
''Ultimately, the Fed will win'' and turn the economy around, said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoening & Company, a brokerage firm in Rye Brook, N.Y., who thinks a recession started late last year.
But, he added, the Fed is more likely to start winning in July than to start winning now.
Behind some of the concern is the technology boom of the late 1990's.
Largely as a result, productivity -- what one worker can produce in one hour -- surged.
But many companies now find themselves with more equipment than they can profitably use.
Unlike extra cars sitting in a dealer's lots, the excess capacity cannot easily be sold off at a discount because the executives never intended to sell it in the first place, said John H. Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.

''It has all the classic elements of an overinvestment bubble,'' Mr. Makin said, adding that companies are unlikely to reverse course the next few months.
The optimists, on the other hand, believe the excess of technology equipment is simply a normal, if somewhat severe, build-up.
Inventories in the auto industry and other old-line businesses have started to fall recently, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. Technology inventories will soon follow, said Dr. Soss of Credit Suisse First Boston.
Companies like Cisco, Intel and Oracle have badly missed their sales estimates not because technology investment is entering a weak era but because managers now have better information about their businesses and can delay orders more quickly than in the past, say the economists who see the expansion continuing.
With inventories shrinking, the Fed cutting rates quickly and Congress moving to cut taxes, economic statistics will soon improve, the optimists add.
Wall Street seems to have come down strongly on this side.
Stocks typically start rising a few months before the end of a slowdown, and many investors believe the economy is recovering.
Consider Cisco, the large maker of Internet equipment.
''This may be the fastest any industry our size has ever decelerated,'' said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive.

Worried economists may think one thing.
But the message from investors could not have been clearer: they seem to think the worst is over.
In fact, by cutting rates yesterday, the Fed acted just as many investors were beginning to become optimistic.
It also removed any doubt that Fed officials count themselves among those who believe that a recession is neither necessary to rid the economy of its imbalances nor unavoidable.
''They're going to be very aggressive,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Economy.com.
Correction: April 23, 2001, Monday A front-page article on Thursday about the effect of the Federal Reserve's cut in interest rates misstated a finding by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter based in Alexandria, Va. On average, economists surveyed by the newsletter believe there is a 38 percent chance the country will enter a recession in the next year.
In trying to sell assets, Mr. Gerungan has been sucked into a maelstrom of competing political and economic interests.

''These cronies of Suharto are predators,'' said Laksamana Sukardi, a former minister for investment and state enterprises.
''They stole billions from state coffers, and they are willing to pay whatever it takes for their survival.
They have only one aim -- to co-opt the current leadership.''
While Mr. Gerungan struggles to unload assets for the highest price, the old owners are maneuvering to reclaim them on the cheap.
They are lobbying the same officials, including Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, who appointed Mr. Gerungan and can fire him at will.
''It's not a job to get attached to.''
Beyond the back-room deals between tycoons and politicians, Mr. Gerungan contends with shaky courts, corrupt police, political tumult and an economy that after rebounding last year, is hemorrhaging again.
And Mr. Gerungan is not just cleaning out the stables.
He labors under the knowledge that his actions can shape the contours of Indonesian commerce for decades to come.
With a portfolio that the World Bank estimates at roughly $50 billion, the banking agency owns a good part of the country's economy.
How officials in Jakarta parcel out the assets is critically important.
If they pursue a nationalist agenda -- as they have shown signs of doing with prized properties like Bank Central Asia -- this could alienate foreign investors who are already wary of putting their capital in Indonesia.
There are other questions.
How much of the assets will the government return to the private sector?
Will it redistribute wealth from ethnic Chinese tycoons to indigenous Indonesians?
Will it let the bank agency make commercial decisions, even if these decisions hurt well-connected tycoons?
''You can't do this job without a lot of political support,'' said James W. Castle, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce here.
''They're not getting the support they need from the president.''
The stakes could not be higher.
Economists and political analysts agree that unless Jakarta cleans up the financial industries, the nation will never regain the growth it enjoyed in the 1980's and early 90's.

''This country needs 6 percent growth to absorb the people who enter the labor force each year,'' said Sjahrir, a prominent economist, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.
''We'll have less than 4 percent this year.
If the economic situation isn't reversed, Indonesia will collapse again.''
There are signs that the country is veering off the rails.
Parliament is preparing to censure President Wahid, a move that could lead to his impeachment.
Supporters of the president have mobilized tens of thousands of demonstrators to march on Jakarta to defend him.
The prospect of violence in the streets has driven stock prices to two-and-a-half-year lows, while the Indonesian rupiah keeps falling against the dollar.
That, in turn, has caused a spike in interest rates, which makes the bank authority's job even harder.
Mr. Gerungan, who spent 25 years at Citibank in Jakarta before becoming a senior vice president at the state-owned Bank Mandiri, is avowedly apolitical.
He says he wants no part of industrial re-engineering.
''We're restructuring companies; we're not restructuring industries,'' he said in an interview.
But the banking agency has sold barely 7 percent of the assets and bad loans it inherited from the banks.
That compares poorly with other Asian countries, which also set up government agencies to rescue or liquidate banks and corporations made insolvent in the financial crisis.
Thailand has sold 70 percent of its debt-laden assets, according to the World Bank.
Malaysia has unloaded 61 percent of its portfolio, and South Korea has sold 48 percent.
Politics has slowed asset sales in those nations, too, particularly in South Korea.
But no Asian country has moved as sluggishly as Indonesia, where every promising piece of news from the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, known from its initials as the I.B.R.A., seems to be countered by political meddling.

But the Indonesian Parliament, which does not have the authority to approve the deal, has nevertheless set up a committee to review it.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
''What you have is a pattern,'' said Mr. Castle of the American Chamber of Commerce.
''The government doesn't want to sell I.B.R.A.
assets.
The government doesn't want to accommodate foreign investors.''
He said that an oversight committee, led by a former Indonesian finance minister, would review major transactions.
The committee is one of several steps suggested by the International Monetary Fund, which had become increasingly worried that the asset sales were being compromised by political factors.
Another rule will restrict the former owner of an asset to a minority stake in the revamped company.
Mr. Gerungan hopes that the guidelines will serve as a buffer for the banking agency, since the oversight committee will be on record as having approved deals.
But this alone will not remove all the potential hazards.
''In the future,'' Mr. Gerungan said, ''rather than just asking for approval, we probably should ask ministers for their judgment on whether certain assets should be sold outright or discussed first with people.''
And the rules are proving difficult to live by.
The conglomerate has been split up, with the agency controlling the textiles unit and the former owner, Marimutu Sinivasan, owning the engineering unit.
That violates the rule limiting former owners to a minority stake.
The oversight committee must review the deal by the end of May.
It is not clear how the rules could have protected the bank authority from a debacle involving one of Canada's largest insurers, the Manulife Financial Corporation.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
At that point, the Jakarta police stepped in to freeze the entire transaction -- and inexplicably to detain one of Manulife's Indonesian vice presidents, Adi Purnomo Wijaya.
But the $18 million it paid for the partner's stake remains beyond the the banking authority's reach -- frozen in an account at Bank Central Asia, itself controlled by the authority.
''They're selling restructuring services, Indonesian style,'' Mr. New said.
''You can almost imagine the ad in a newspaper: if you're a conglomerate battling with creditors, we can help you whisk the assets away.''
Not surprisingly, he is eager to start fresh this year.
Mr. Gerungan has set an ambitious goal of raising $2.5 billion in cash through asset sales.
That would be almost a third more than what the authority sold last year.
And it would go a long way toward convincing skeptical investors that Indonesia is finally serious about putting its house in order.
Among other goals, Mr. Gerungan has pledged to sell 40 percent of Bank Central Asia, Indonesia's largest private bank, which was also controlled by the Salims.
But some members of Parliament are protesting that Indonesia should not sell the crown jewel of its banking industry to outsiders.
The trouble is, critics say, that Mr. Gerungan does not have either the background or the political support to fend off such pressure.
''He has no idea what he is tackling.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
People who know Mr. Gerungan say he is a man of integrity, determined to impose professional standards on an institution that many complain has become as rotten as some of the assets it controls.
But even his friends are skeptical of his chances of succeeding.
Indeed, the bank agency has had three chairmen in the last year.
Will Mr. Gerungan resign if it is clear that he is failing like his predecessors?
''Maybe they'll fire me before I do that,'' he said with a harsh laugh, the only one in an otherwise somber conversation.
He became one of the world's foremost experts in using deep-space photographs to map the planets, a process known as planetary photogrammetry.
In World War II, he joined Douglas Aircraft in California, doing the mathematics required for lofting fighter planes.

Only the oil industry, with billions of dollars in investments, and to a lesser extent the mining industry are pouring more money, much of it American, into Angola.
The country's coastal seabed is bursting with oil, and pockets of its interior are teeming with diamonds.
In recent years, among African countries, only Nigeria and South Africa have rivaled Angola for direct American investment.
Yet Coke's experience shows that a single large investment often has only modest benefits in a country like Angola.
Unless the government decides to shift much of its oil earnings into solving extensive social problems, the country will need dozens, if not hundreds, of investments like it.
And the challenges for Coke show just how just how hard it will be to persuade other investors that the risk is worthwhile.
Even Coke, a multinational corporation, has hit many obstacles opening and operating a business in a country where civil war has raged for years and where corruption is institutionalized.
There is, of course, the curfew, around which employees' workdays and delivery truck departures must be scheduled.
Most of the roads between cities, -- roads that should carry Coke to the far corners of the country -- are considered too dangerous to travel day or night; they are vulnerable to rebel ambushes and land mines.
As a result, the local bottling company, according to its own estimates, can reach only 3.2 million of the 5 million people in the nine provinces covered by its franchise.
And then there is Angola's reputation as a bureaucratic black hole, where bribery is the surest and sometimes the only way of clearing a police checkpoint, obtaining a construction permit or moving supplies through customs.
SOME people are quite surprised that the company has invested here at all,'' said Islay Rhind, managing director of Coca-Cola Bottling (Luanda), the joint venture established by Coca-Cola, the Angolan government and South African Breweries.
Mr. Rhind, a Scottish Coca-Cola veteran who has served all over Africa, from Botswana to Kenya to Nigeria, is more than willing to enumerate the difficulties of doing business here -- but he makes it clear that he considers none of them insurmountable.
''We bring with us a very rigid code of conduct, which isn't necessarily very popular in a place like Angola, which has this reputation for corruption,'' Mr. Rhind said.
''But that's who we are, that's what we are, that's the way we do business.''

Sticking to such policies was simple, he said; explaining them was harder.
''It was very difficult to get people to understand that that's what we do and why,'' he said.
''We don't pay bribes.
We don't take bribes.
It's a hard road, but that's the way it is.''
As difficult and as uncomfortable as fending off demands for bribes may be at the outset, he said, it ultimately makes business easier.
''Once the community knows who you are, what you are, it ceases to become an issue,'' he said.
''Everyone knows we won't pay to have our telephones reconnected, we won't pay policemen to let our trucks through, so we don't have to bribe anybody.''
Having operated in sub-Saharan Africa since 1938, Coca-Cola has learned to live with the continent's rough edges.
''But we as a business want to be there, and we will do our damnedest to be there as long as we can without putting our people or our business in danger.''
As a result, Coca-Cola was able to consolidate its hold on South Africa, which today is its biggest African market and its hub in the region.
With its return to Angola, Coca-Cola now does business in nearly all of Africa, with about 150 bottling operations on the continent.
Only Libya and Sudan, which are officially off limits to American companies, have no Coca-Cola operations.
Some countries where the risks of doing business are high, like Somalia and Liberia, have distribution networks but no local production operations.
Other conflict areas, like Burundi, Congo and now Angola, have local distribution and production.
Sometimes, as in Burundi, a beer brewer like Heineken, in a joint venture with Coca-Cola, handles the production.
Elsewhere, as in Angola, the production is at a Coca-Cola plant jointly owned by the company and partners like the government and local breweries.
There is money to be made.
''If you look at our annual report, you will see we are profitable in Africa,'' Mr. Lindsay said.
''It's a challenging business, but it's still a profitable business and that's why we are still there.''
Coca-Cola's results for 2000 show that the company does make money in Africa -- although it is far more profitable elsewhere.

IT is Africa's potential for sales and profits, however, that intrigues Coca-Cola.
The company's case volume, a measure of growth in the beverage industry, expanded by 10 percent in Africa in the first quarter, versus a year earlier.
That compares with marginal increases in more developed markets in the Americas and Europe.
''Our core business has the potential for significant expansion,'' said Douglas N. Daft, the chairman and chief executive, in announcing the company's first-quarter results last week.
''People outside the United States drink less than one serving of carbonated soft drinks a week.
Within the U.S., consumers drink more than one serving a day.''
In that context, Coca-Cola's foray into African countries like Angola makes sense.
Over the last few years -- the last one in particular -- Angola has undergone considerable changes that have made it a less hostile place to run a business.
While the war still appears to be far from an end, government forces have won significant gains, creating a measure of security around the cities where international companies operate.
The government has agreed to work with the International Monetary Fund on economic reforms and to allow limited auditing of the government-controlled oil sector.
Such changes have created enough stability for Coca-Cola, if not many other companies.
But a few of them are trying.
One is Seaboard Commodity Trading and Milling, part of the Seaboard Corporation of Shawnee Mission, Kan.
The company, an agricultural products concern that also does business in Congo, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, came to Angola a couple of years ago.
It has invested about $4.5 million rehabilitating an old wheat mill, and began production a month ago.
Another is Delta Cafes of Lisbon, which has been rebuilding one of the country's principal coffee factories; the plant had been shuttered for 15 years.
Now it ranks 28th in global production,
Earlier in the planning stages is Citibank, the banking unit of Citigroup, which is weighing its options.
It has had a small staff in the country, in what is known as a representative office, for about two years, according to Marcus Andrade, the regional managing director.
The bank hopes to open a commercial bank here eventually, he said.
That step, if taken, would provide more banking options for major international corporations, which are now served almost exclusively by Portuguese banks.
But Mr. Andrade says Citibank's plans depend on the potential for growth and stability in the country.
(A tiny, independently owned plant in the central city of Huambo never closed completely, but its production has been minuscule and erratic because of difficulty in obtaining supplies.)

By the early 1990's, demand was growing.
Coca-Cola decided in 1992 to take a small step back into the Angolan market, arranging to oversee the imports.
But six years would pass before the company took the bigger step of re-establishing shop in the country.
A couple of years after that, its bottles began rolling off the production lines of the freshly scrubbed, red-trimmed plant here.
Now flatbed trucks carrying stacks of bottle-filled crates to distribution centers are a common sight on the road between Bom Jesus and Luanda.

IN the streets of the capital, bright-red umbrellas emblazoned with the Coca-Cola logo are everywhere, hoisted by young men peddling bottles of Coke, Fanta and Sprite from big red coolers.
In shops in and around the capital, new refrigerators supplied by Coca-Cola to 1,200 retail outlets keep sodas cold.
The 12-ounce bottles sell for about 8 new kwanza, or around 40 cents at current exchange rates, well below prices in the United States and not prohibitively expensive in Angola.
''The majority of people can afford it,'' said Dade Alvaro, 20, who sells sodas on Rua N'Gola Kiluange, down the street from Coca-Cola's local headquarters.
Working from about 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., six days a week, he sells about five cases a day and takes home about $8 a day.
It is not much, but it helps him pay his share of the rent while he works at becoming a mechanic.
''For the moment, it's good.
I'm happy,'' he said.
Coca-Cola's attempt to increase its Angolan business partly reflects an African expansion effort begun in 1997 by M. Douglas Ivester, then the company's chairman and chief executive.
Over the last five years, the company has poured about $600 million into Africa, Mr. Lindsay said.
In fact, Coca-Cola's business success in Africa has been one of the few bright spots in its recent history, known more for episodes like an embarrassing and costly contamination scare in Europe a few years ago and accusations of racial discrimination against its black employees in the United States.
Almost a year ago, the company pledged $1 billion over five years to programs aimed at strengthening partnerships with businesses owned by minorities and women.
And a settlement for the roughly 2,200 plaintiffs in a class action against the company could be approved in the next few months -- another step in the company's efforts to rebuild its relationship with blacks.
Coca-Cola says its efforts in Africa, whatever effect they may have on its image at home, are about business.
''We're certainly aware that what we do in Africa has a residual effect and is of interest to many people, including the African-American community here,'' said Ben Deutsch, a Coca-Cola spokesman in Atlanta.
''But the bottom line is, our investment there is driven by our desire to grow our business in Africa.''

Bottling as close as possible to customers is an important part of that strategy, Mr. Lindsay said.
''The reason is that the core of our business is affordability,'' he added, ''and when you have to transport the product into the country, it makes it much more expensive.''
That is why Coca-Cola's Africa operation does not bottle beverages in just the handful of countries that are, comparatively speaking, politically stable, like South Africa, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
And it is why Coca-Cola ended up back in Angola.
Among African nations, Angola ranks 12th in total sales of Coke, just after Mozambique and Ghana and just ahead of Uganda and Namibia.
But while establishing a local presence here was almost certainly the highest hurdle, others remain.
One is the black market that supplies canned Coca-Cola products.
By evading import duties and shipping costs, black-market dealers undercut local bottlers.
Such problems are not unexpected and not entirely avoidable in a place like Angola, Mr. Rhind said.
But with its 45 percent stake in the company, the Angolan government has great interest in seeing the venture flourish, and Coca-Cola is confident that the authorities are doing what they can to combat duty evasion and product dumping.
''I don't think it will disappear entirely, forever,'' Mr. Rhind said.
''I don't believe that for one instant, but that's just how it is.
You have to handle that.''
Operations in Angola have been hampered by a shortage of workers with skills in areas like accounting and advanced mechanics, as well as by difficulties in obtaining production supplies.
But the company has been encouraged by the swift improvement.
''We budgeted to have fairly low efficiencies at our plant to start off with, which is normal in any country in the world,'' Mr. Rhind said, ''and I guess we were both racial and paternalistic in assuming that that would continue for longer than one normally would expect.

''In fact, the opposite is the case,'' he added.
''Our employees picked up the efficiencies and qualities very quickly, much more quickly than we would have expected.''
It is now at 14 million a year.
FROM the huge vats where white sugar is mixed into water to the deafening roar of the filling machines, about 80 people work in production.
Another 60 or so are in administrative and support jobs.
For many Angolan employees, this is the first steady, formal work they have had in a long time, maybe their lifetimes.
That applies even to some of the handful who have management jobs, most of which are held by foreigners.
So she waited, biding her time working as a translator and a secretary.
Now she is a supervisor in the plant's quality control lab.
''We have to start at the beginning,'' she said of her country, ''and it's very important to be part of that.''
THE shortages of local supplies -- and the resulting high costs -- are evident on a walk around the plant floor.
In one corner are stacks, at least 15 feet high, of boxes containing new Coca-Cola bottles.
The boxes are stamped ''Al Tajir Glass,'' referring in English and Arabic to the company in the United Arab Emirates that makes the bottles.

Near the purification system that pumps out water from the Cuanza River are 220 metric tons of sugar, a sizable stockpile even for a business that trades in sweetness.
The huge stockpiles of sugar and other supplies are needed because deliveries here are erratic -- often held up in delays at the port.
According to Harvard's 2000-2001 Africa Competitiveness Report, the average time needed for imports to clear customs in Angola was 49 days, compared with 20 in Kenya, 9 in South Africa, 7 in Botswana and 5 in Morocco.
The costs of such a distorted supply chain are high for Coca-Cola, and for the country.
The company has created factory and office jobs for just over 300 people, and hundreds more now sell sodas on the street.
But Angola's economy has not yet added many of the jobs in services and in supply manufacturing that such an investment ordinarily spawns.
WITH an end to the war elusive, Coca-Cola and the plant's potential spinoffs account for much of what little hope the country has for economic gains.
The booming oil industry, set largely off the shores of the country and dependent on skilled workers scarcely found here, has done almost nothing to end the suffering of Angola's 12.9 million people.
Of every 100 babies born in Angola, 19 die before their first birthday; the overall life expectancy is about 38 years.
More than a million people, many of them driven from their land by the fighting, are fed by the World Food Program of the United Nations.
It is exactly the sort of spinoff that Angola needs.
The crates, however, are used over and over, even more than the bottles.
So demand for crates is tiny; it supports just eight jobs.
Still, Angola's advocates hope that such ventures are a start -- and a signal that the country is changing and improving as an investment destination, even as the war persists.
''The way the country is going and the prospect of investing and making money are quite different from what it would have been two years ago.''
While many prestamistas lend money at illegal interest rates, some compete directly with mainstream banks.
They are fast, reliable and often understanding, and in many of New York City's Latino neighborhoods, the prestamistas are the lenders people turn to first.

''Loan sharks are our biggest competitors, and they're killing us,'' said Dennis Reeder, executive director of the Washington Heights and Inwood Development Corporation, a nonprofit group that makes loans to small businesses.
Mr. Reeder says the vast majority of his clients have borrowed money from loan sharks, often at interest rates as high as 10 percent per week, and his organization often lends money to help people to pay them off.
''There is a lot of money to made here,'' said Tony, a prestamista who says he has financed dozens of businesses in Washington Heights and the Bronx.
Informal types of lending like loan sharking have been around for years, but the volume and variety of recent immigration have brought an array of new types.
Korean immigrants, for instance, make wide use of a system called kye (pronounced kay), in which members contribute to a savings pool and take turns borrowing.
Some Latino communities use a similar system known as tanda or sociedad.
In many communities, the moneylenders ask fewer questions and prove remarkably flexible when a borrower cannot pay.
''These informal lenders are providing a valuable service,'' said Jay Rosengard, a faculty member at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, who has studied informal financial networks in immigrant communities.
''People will pay the interest rates, because they want the access to credit.''
Sometimes the lawless financial world turns violent.
In May 1998, two well-known moneylenders in the Korean community were murdered as they sat in their Lexus in a Queens neighborhood.

In New York's Latino neighborhoods, some people say they are following the tradition of their homelands, where the poor often have no banks and little money to save.
They say they are reluctant to use regular banks because of questions about their immigration status.
Some say they do not keep the detailed financial records needed to qualify for a loan.
One major reason for the prestamistas' popularity may be the lack of success many Latinos have had in trying to borrow from banks.
Mr. Sanchez says he was turned down for loans at Citibank and Chase several years ago, and does not bother trying anymore.
''I don't like the prestamistas, but I use them,'' he said.
In the world of the impoverished immigrant, where a big telephone bill can shatter a month's budget, the speed and certainty of loan shark money often matter more than the high interest rate.
Maira Gonzalez, a waitress at a restaurant in Washington Heights, recently borrowed $2,000 from a local prestamista to pay for a trip to the Dominican Republic, where her three children live.
The weekly interest is 5 percent.
''Nobody wants to borrow money, but we are poor people and sometimes we have to,'' said Ms. Gonzalez, who earns about $250 a week.

New York law caps interest rates on most bank loans at 25 percent per year, 16 percent on person-to-person loans.
The going rate among loan sharks in some Latino neighborhoods is 2 to 5 percent per week -- or about 104 to 260 percent per year.
Loan sharking in New York's Latino neighborhoods appears to be flourishing despite law enforcement efforts.
Loan sharking in New York's newly arrived immigrant communities, he said, is a different phenomenon and hard to pursue.
''There is an ingrained money lending business,'' he said.
''I've always understood that it worked pretty well.
People respect the rules.
We don't get a lot of reports about intimidation.''
The business of private lending is also thriving despite the presence of large banks, which have made mixed efforts to penetrate the city's poorer neighborhoods.
Some public interest groups say bank mergers in recent years have diminished the number of banks and the quality of services in poor neighborhoods, making it harder for people to borrow money and all but forcing them into the hands of the loan sharks.
The big banks say that they have made efforts to penetrate the city's poorer neighborhoods, but that they face formidable obstacles -- cultural and financial -- to attracting customers.

Another reason may be that some prestamistas are willing to drop interest rates for their best customers.
The loan sharks portray themselves as ordinary businessmen providing a service where their mainstream competitors fear to tread.
Tony, the loan shark active in Washington Heights, says that he and his two partners have lent millions of dollars to mostly Dominican clients to help start area businesses.
''We do about eight deals a week,'' said Tony, dressed in an expensive suit.
''Every one of them has been denied at a bank.''
Tony deals only in cash and usually charges 5 percent a week.
Such an agreement may not be legally enforceable, he said, but the practice works, even if sometimes it is accompanied by threats.
''We're not going to break any legs,'' Tony said, ''but we have taken property back.''
Carlos, a South Bronx prestamista who says he lends no more than $3,000 to any one person, keeps a safety deposit box full of collateral like gold chains and wristwatches.
To ensure that his clients do not disappear, Carlos says he often holds a borrower's immigration papers until the loan is repaid.
''I know my people,'' he said.
''They get some money, they'll go to Santo Domingo, especially at Christmas, spend it all and come back with nothing.''

Even with loan sharking thriving in the city's Latino neighborhoods, leaders of local nonprofit groups say they try to coax people into banking's mainstream.
Then, in 1999, Mr. Balcacer saw an ad in a local Spanish-language newspaper for Neighborhood Trust, a nonprofit credit union in Washington Heights, from which he has borrowed several thousand dollars to spruce up his store.
The interest rates are wonderfully low, he says.
''I'll never use the prestamistas again.''
Instead of masking emotions with alcohol, the masters learned to recognize what they were feeling -- whether it was fear, sadness, anger or happiness -- and to allow themselves to experience it, express it and deal with it in a healthier way, for example, by talking or writing about it or going off by themselves and yelling or crying.
They also learned that few feelings are long lasting -- wait a bit and they go away -- and that it is all right to be in a bad mood for a while.
Two-thirds of the masters indicated that they had benefited from counseling or therapy in addition to participating in recovery groups.
Others use indirect techniques like punching pillows, taking brisk walks or hot baths, writing about the problems or even lying down and letting the anger wash over them and then taking naps.
Some found that changing a stressful job situation -- getting a new one or changing an old one -- was important in maintaining sobriety.
Celebrations and happy feelings can also be problems for people trying to enjoy them without drinking.
Others do rewarding activities like buying flowers, books or records; getting massages; singing and jumping for joy; trying new restaurants, or doing nice things for others.
Even more difficult are social situations where alcohol is an integral part.
1 answer for how they now handle parties, weddings, business dinners and traveling is to drink some sort of nonalcoholic beverage.''
One of my friends goes to parties with her own nonalcoholic beer.
Another requests a soft drink.
A third drinks water.
A few simply decline invitations to cocktail parties and other events where consuming alcohol is the featured event.
Duane L. said: ''I get something nonalcoholic and keep it full.
If all else fails, I tell people I'm driving.''
Or nondrinkers can say that they are taking medicine that does not mix with alcohol or that they are allergic to alcohol.
Perhaps the simplist response to a drink pusher is ''no thanks'' or ''thanks, but I don't drink.''

In dealing with alcohol at home, Ms. Fletcher believes that when sobriety is new, it is easier for most people if their live-in companions do not drink, give up alcohol for a while or drink only in the sober person's absence.
But almost half the masters keep alcohol in their homes for housemates or guests, and 40 percent said they lived with one or more persons who drank.

Joy Without Alcohol
Ms. Fletcher found that the masters she interviewed ''seem joyful about the richness and fullness of their sober lives: they get high on life without abusing alcohol and seek fulfillment and pleasure in its absence.''
They have filled their lives with new sources of gratification and meaningful endeavors, among them reading, pursuing hobbies and the arts, traveling, enjoying nature and the outdoors, eating well and engaging in fitness activities.
For example, Heather F. now exercises at the time of day that she used to start drinking.
Marisa S. said she ''learned to revel in small pleasures each day'' like gardening, having brunch with friends, taking walks, enjoying sunsets, admiring flowers, reading or being silly with her husband.
Becky H. said she wove ''a tapestry of sobriety: I notice things, positive things, and revel in them -- a raindrop sliding down a leaf, my baby's giggle, the cat's paws twitching in her sleep, the smell of the gardenia.''
A favorite pleasure-enhancing activity of the masters is helping others through volunteer work, community service or involvement in civic organizations.
Some even switched careers to ones that help others.
Two-thirds of the masters said they sought greater career satisfaction by improving their job situations or furthering their educations.
Then, there is the matter of improving and enjoying relationships.
More than half the masters listed enjoying or appreciating family or friends as one of the top three ways of seeking pleasure.
Fixing family relationships that were seriously hurt by alcohol abuse can often be challenging, and Ms. Fletcher said, ''It is not uncommon for marriages and families to break up within the first year or two of sobriety.''
But counseling, communication classes, personal improvement seminars and recovery meetings together have proved helpful to many.
Major Alcoholism Study
In the years since Anne Fletcher's ''masters'' achieved sobriety, medications have come into increasing use to help people overcome alcohol abuse.
To advance this approach, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism announced last month the start of a nationwide study to test the value of combining medication with behavioral intervention.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The study, to be conducted at 11 treatment centers, will enroll 1,375 people who are dependent on alcohol and randomly assign them to different treatment protocols: one or both of two behavioral treatments (moderate intensity and lower intensity) and one or both of two medications (naltrexone and acamprosate, to help prevent relapse) or a placebo.
Outpatient treatment will be given for four months, followed by three follow-up visits over the next year.
Potential participants may call 1- 866-80STUDY or consult the Web site, www.niaaa.nih.gov.
Acknowledging that the slowdown in the United States will retard European economic growth after all, the European Commission cut its 2001 forecast for growth in the 12 nations adopting the euro currency by 0.4 percentage point today, to 2.8 percent.
And it is in shakier fiscal shape than its partners: relative to the size of the economy, Germany's budget deficit this year is expected to be the largest in the European Union, at 1.7 percent of gross domestic product.
Unemployment was seen falling from about 8.9 percent in 2000 to 8.5 percent in 2001 and 7.9 percent in 2002.
''Our methodology does give rise to more optimistic results than other institutions,'' Mr. Solbes acknowledged.
''But often these are closer to reality.''
The European Central Bank once again refused to reduce interest rates, turning aside pleas from some European political leaders and charting a staunchly separate course from that of the United States Federal Reserve.

A parallel, and less predictable, debate has arisen over the issue of televising the execution.
Ever since the author Thomas Lynch made an eloquent case on this page in February for the public's right to see the death being enacted by the state in its name, many anti-death penalty editorialists have seconded it.
One common line of argument is that a public execution will cause Americans to question their own support for future executions -- though a chilling counterargument has it that a televised execution might go down all too smoothly in a gladiatorial culture where the W.W.F.
and ''reality'' programming like MTV's ''Jackass'' and UPN's ''Chains of Love'' are prime-time entertainment.
It's worth asking if we can actually tell the difference between reality and ''reality'' programming anymore.
''What's the big deal?''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But even as we debate the merits of holding or watching executions, there seems to be widespread support for Mr. Ashcroft's view that we avert our eyes from those of Mr. McVeigh himself.
(Since when is a network news anchor's job to send a message, let alone by his choice of urban backdrop?)
Similarly, the country's largest retailer, Wal-Mart, has banned the selling of ''American Terrorist,'' the journalistic account of the bombing written by the two Buffalo News reporters who covered the story, Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck.
The Army and Air Force Exchange Service, I learned this week, has also elected not to sell the book on military bases -- maintaining, according to Maj. Philip Smith, its public affairs officer, that the decision was based only on ''sales potential.''

That explanation doesn't fly.
The book is in fact a best seller -- No.
2 on The Times's list -- and deservedly so.
The authors have woven 150 interviews, including 75 hours' worth with Mr. McVeigh, into what is likely to stand as the definitive record of the crime and the man who committed it.
Though much publicity has attended the book's revelation of Mr. McVeigh's abhorrent lack of remorse, as exemplified by his description of the bombing's child casualties as ''collateral damage,'' the Ashcroft head-in-the-sand attitude prevails in the relatively scant attention paid to the bulk of the book devoted to the ordinariness of its American terrorist.
Mr. McVeigh was not your typical troubled loner who explodes on the nation's front pages.
He was a Buffalo Bills fan, a junkie not for drugs but news, a Catholic of catholic cultural tastes (''Star Wars'') whose unremarkable senior high school yearbook photo inscription read, ''Take it as it comes, buy a Lamborghini, California girls.''
The ''most disturbing thing about him,'' said Mr. Michel, the book's co-author, in a conversation this week, ''is that he's a three-dimensional person.
Most people would love to dismiss him as a Charles Manson or Jeffrey Dahmer -- a flat-line monster with a swastika on his forehead.
But he's a son of suburbia who had every advantage in life.''
If anything, Mr. McVeigh, who had a latchkey childhood marked by some bullying, offers ''a through line to the school shooters of today,'' says Mr. Michel.
For us to turn our back, and say no, this is just too painful to look at, is to invite the possibility of it happening again.''
According to the psychiatrist hired by his defense attorney, Mr. McVeigh was sane.
''There are millions of Americans who share his anti-government views,'' says Mr. Michel, some of the most extreme of whom are now writing fan letters to the condemned man in prison.
Even Mr. McVeigh ''calls them kooks and crazies,'' adds the writer, who remains in communication with his book's subject in his final weeks.
Those weeks are going to be filled with the white noise of an all-American circus.
Any profiteer or publicity hound that can find his way to Terre Haute will do so, and will soon be dutifully showcased on TV for our delectation.
But the false pieties of supposed leaders like John Ashcroft and those in the media who mimic his closure mongering are more offensive than the clowns peddling their tacky T-shirts.
The circumstances that produce a Timothy McVeigh are not going to be eradicated by shutting down his interviews, banning his words or, for that matter, ending his life.
To promote the fiction that such closure is attainable is, as our attorney general would put it, to be a co-conspirator in Mr. McVeigh's assault on America's public safety and upon America itself.
Value investors like Mr. Buffett are the investment world's discount shoppers, looking for reliable companies that are worth more than their stock prices reflect.
Growth investors, on the other hand, have an eye for glamour, for companies, often in technology, with the most rapidly rising sales and profits, even if their shares sell at a premium.

''If you're the kind of person who will walk across the street to get a better price on a hotel room, you're probably a value investor,'' said Robert P. Miles, a Tampa, Fla., businessman who became so enamored of the Buffett style after a few years of owning Berkshire shares that he wrote a book, ''101 Reasons to Own the World's Greatest Investment,'' which has just been published.
As technology stocks rocketed, some leading value investors, like Julian Robertson of Tiger Management, simply gave up on managing large pools of money.
But now value is back.
Now it's pretty clear they have been reborn and rectified.''
The flow of investors' money demonstrates the trend.
In February and March, money streamed out of mutual funds featuring Internet and technology stocks and began flowing into funds that generally follow a value investing philosophy.
The value investments have been holding their own or even gaining a little.
Of the 31 categories of mutual funds tracked by Lipper Inc., all lost money in the first three months of this year except value funds that hold relatively small companies.
Even some of the loyalists at the meeting tactfully suggested to Mr. Buffett that he might need to update his style.
This year, one investor generated a wave of applause by rising to thank Mr. Buffett for resisting the technology sector's lure.

Now some Wall Street wizards caution that the market might already be taking another turn that would sideline the value crowd once again.
Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, sees evidence that technology and other growth stocks are once again gathering steam, to the detriment of value stocks.
''When you have a situation in which interest rates are falling and price-earnings multiples are expanding,'' Mr. Applegate said, referring to the ratio of share price to earnings per share, ''growth typically outperforms value.
And that's what we've been seeing.''

As for Mr. Buffett, whose Berkshire holdings are worth nearly $33 billion, it remains unclear whether he can continue delivering the gains that brought Berkshire Hathaway, which has never split its stock, from $27 a share in 1967 to a peak of more than $80,000 in 1998.
His largest investments, including Coca-Cola and Gillette, have been languishing far below their highs, troubled by poor sales and management shake-ups.
And Berkshire's single largest unit, General Re, a leader in selling insurance to insurance companies, has been gushing losses since Mr. Buffett bought it for nearly $22 billion in 1998.
Mr. Buffett is keeping the faith with his insurance holdings, saying that insurance prices are rising, and with his name-brand stocks.
But rather than invest in more stocks this year, he said, he is likely to hunt for entire businesses to buy.
Lately, he remarked, referring to a market he still regards as overheated, ''the climate has not been friendly toward buying'' stocks.
''It is just astounding to me,'' he added, ''how willing people are, during a bull market, to throw money around.''
Last year, Mr. Buffett bought eight companies that produce enduring, if unexciting, things like bricks, carpets and cowboy boots.
''We remain awash in liquid assets and are both eager and ready for even larger acquisitions,'' Mr. Buffett wrote in Berkshire's annual report.
''The larger the company, the greater will be our interest.''
To warm shareholders up before the serious business began, Mr. Buffett presented, as he does each year, an hourlong film spoofing himself and his close friend Charles T. Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman.
The film opened with Mr. Buffett strumming a ukelele.
At one point, in one of many cameo appearances by famous friends, he was shown caddying for Tiger Woods.

Mr. Buffett kept the quips coming as he and Mr. Munger fielded questions from shareholders in what many financial experts regard as an incomparable seminar in value investing.
''I'm Warren,'' Mr. Buffett said by way of introduction.
''He's Charlie.
He can hear.
I can see.''
''One of the cornerstones of the value approach,'' said Robert G. Hagstrom, who runs a Legg Mason value fund and has written several books about Mr. Buffett's investing style, ''is a tendency to give back less than the market as a whole when things get bad.''
In more than 30 years of running Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett has never had a losing year, although he came close in 1999 with a gain of just half of 1 percent.
Jack and Betty Rhodes, a retired couple living in Peoria, Ill., started investing in Berkshire five years ago.
Over all, they say, their portfolio is down 17 percent this year, much less worse than it would have been without the Berkshire investment.
''Compared to the tech stocks,'' Mrs. Rhodes said, ''you'd have to be euphoric about Berkshire.''
''Everybody knows he's brought us through a very dangerous time in the markets,'' said Andrew Kilpatrick, a Birmingham, Ala., stockbroker and Berkshire shareholder who has also written a book on Mr. Buffett.
''It took tremendous character to not say, 'O.K., I'll buy some tech to get everybody off my back.'
With hindsight, now we can say he was right.
He's in better shape than anybody else.''
Trains have defined him ever since.
''You get them in your blood,'' he says.
Today, Mr. Monte Verde is the president of his own railroad, a profession so uncommon, so linked to another time, that it conjures images of pocket watches and top hats.
Strangers often misunderstand him to mean that he somehow earns a living by overseeing a fleet of model railroads.
No, he has to explain: I own the real thing.

His is a short-line railroad called the Genesee Valley Transportation Company, which at last count had 27 locomotives, hundreds of boxcars and control of nearly 300 miles of track in New York and Pennsylvania.
When a major hauler chugs into the grimy Utica yard with raw copper from Texas, a G.V.T.
engine takes over, pulling the loaded cars down 13 miles of track and into the red-brick maw of the Revere Copper Products plant in Rome.
Mr. Monte Verde, 55, carries his solid build with the frenetic air of a commuter waiting for a train running late.
''It kind of got away from me,'' he says.
He has learned that the business of railroading spares little time for sentiment; there are customers to woo, government grants to win, connections to make.
It is also a sobering barometer of the fragile upstate New York economy.
The comment reveals the blurred distinctions in Mr. Monte Verde's life, between work and leisure, rail yard and home, past and present.
He often lapses into the language of an alternate universe: of wide cabs, Alcos and ''moving meets'' (the point at which two trains traveling in opposite directions pass each other).
He says that ''being a railroader takes over your life.''
For example, one of his most vivid memories as a parent is the time, nearly 20 years ago, when he changed the diapers of his oldest son, Charlie, in a Buffalo rail yard.
''It was his first rail-fan trip,'' the proud father says.
Those in the railroad industry say the arrangement has generally worked out well, with the major rail companies teaming with the short-line operations to haul goods and material.
Even so, railroading has its familial tensions.
Many rail fans blame the businesses for mismanaging and ultimately killing dozens of passenger and freight trains that once inched across the nation's belly with proud and poetic names.
(Once there was the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe; now there is Amtrak.)
But many rail businesses regard the rail fans as nostalgia-addled fanatics who expect them to run empty passenger trains at a financial loss, simply to conjure nice memories and provide the occasional photographic moment.
Mark Hemphill, the editor of Trains magazine, says the discontinuation of many passenger trains in the 1950's and 60's spurred a mutual distrust that manifests itself today in odd ways.
Conspiracy theories abound.
Some rail companies even delicately ask whether a job applicant is, how shall we put this, a rail enthusiast, forcing some to become what are called ''closet rail fans.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
''The feeling has been that the rail fan will run trains for the sake of running trains, whether or not they make money,'' Mr. Hemphill says.
But he adds that the idea that an enthusiast cannot be prudent in the business of railroading is ''silly.''

There are, after all, the likes of Mr. Monte Verde -- his company's logo on his shirt, a worn trainman's switch key in his pocket.
The inside of his well-traveled Dodge sedan crackles with the short-wave conversations between dispatchers and train engineers.
Whenever he sees an Amtrak train whiz past, he reaches for the schedule he keeps tucked in the car's sun visor, just to see how late it is running.
But that cluttered Dodge is a satellite office of his company's headquarters in Batavia, about 23 miles east of Buffalo.
He roams the state and eastern Pennsylvania, meeting with clients, buttering up politicians, and doing anything else he can to keep his company profitable.
All the while, he fed his rail passion, studying railroad history and taking train photographs by the score.
''Then we bought two more,'' he says.
Today, the partnership that became Genesee Valley Transportation oversees five active rail lines.
They include the Depew, Lancaster & Western Railroad, featuring a seven-mile run in Batavia that moves loads of fertilizer and beer; the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad, which hauls grain and propane 30 miles from Scranton to the Poconos; and the Mohawk, Adirondack & Northern Railroad, here in Utica.
The morning after his lasagna feast, Mr. Monte Verde walks through the gravel and grime of the Utica rail yard, pausing to examine a 1964 Alco engine nicknamed Jumbo.
A rail fan, he says, marvels at the paint scheme of the engine, imagines photographing it against a setting gumdrop sun.
But an owner studies the wear and tear on the steel wheels, and wonders whether it is time for old Jumbo to take a trip to the repair shop.
Soon the 132-ton Jumbo is chugging through the rail-yard landscape of wheat-colored cattails and 20-foot piles of logs, ''switching and kicking'' rail cars into position along several tracks.
Some contain junk destined for a steel mill; others carry copper for the Revere plant in Rome.
The engineer, Bob Hoffman, stout and 51, lives outside Rochester but spends four nights a week in a converted rail car he keeps in the yard.
He adjusts the throttle and peers into his side-view mirror, occasionally pausing to bite a glazed doughnut and slurp some cold coffee.
But that mill closed, and now he spends weeknights on a cot in Utica.
Part of his job is to hop off the engine every now and then to set the switches and rattle off the identification letters and numbers of the cars over a two-way radio.
''Fire away there, Jeff,'' the engineer says, clipboard and pen in hand.
''HWA 12778, HWA 882202.''
Mr. Monte Verde rides with them for a while in the battleship-gray engine cab; with voices raised above Jumbo's heaves and sighs, he and the men talk trains.
About that remote station sign, just above Boonville, which simply says ''Hell.''
About the exact meaning of that milepost in the yard (''It means we're 235 miles from Grand Central Terminal,'' Mr. Monte Verde says).
The agile Mr. Collins leaves the cab and pulls the pin that connects Jumbo to its load.
The four rail cars roll away, as if in a dream, onto a sidetrack, where they will be hitched up and pulled on another day.
''That's a perfect kick,'' Mr. Monte Verde says, in the language of his universe.
There, in black and white, is the clapboard building, the platform, the shingle bearing the name of the town.
And there, near the baggage cart, is 16-year-old David Monte Verde, hands on hips and tears to come.

Where the Exhibitions Crawl
The busy workers on the first floor of the three-story office building on a commercial strip in working-class northeast Philadelphia seem to sense no irony.
They work for Steve's Bug-Off, an exterminating business in the building, and politely send you upstairs when you ask about the Insectarium, an eight-year-old, two-floor paean to creatures with at least six legs.
Upstairs are thousands of mounted butterflies and moths and bugs of all colors and shapes and origins.
But there are also exhibits you might call interactive.
Faith Kuehn, the staff entomologist, will let you tickle a live Madagascar hissing roach, which shoots out air when danger is near.
Or maybe you'll like the petting zoo, near the corner of Spider Street and Arachnid Alley, with scorpions and velvet ants and death-feigning beetles, which drop over somnolent to ward off attackers looking for live food.

Finally, in 1954, the A's moved to Kansas City, and in 1968, after more losing years, to Oakland.
The A's Museum, however, remains.
It has gloves, bats, shirts and programs from the good years and bad.
There's a 1941 letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Mack and another, more sentimental, from the slugger Jimmie Foxx to a young fan, Jimmy McHugh, which reads in part, ''As we both have the same first name, we must stick together.''
Said Ted Taylor, the founder of the Philadelphia A's Historical Society, ''We've tried to start a National Association of Defunct Baseball Teams.''
But, he added, ''we're the only one with a museum.
Perhaps Philadelphians are just more of a sentimental lot.''

''Glass is fragile, just like liberty,'' Mr. Borowsky said.
''It can be smashed by violence.''
Running entirely through the museum's three floors is the museum's centerpiece, the fire-red, hydralike Flame of Liberty, by Mr. Borowsky's favorite glass sculptor, Dale Chihuly.
Glass sculptures from a dozen other countries are on display, among exhibits about freedom.
Glass sculptures from a dozen other countries are also on view, but Mr. Borowsky, who shows up often, always directs young visitors to the Jelly-Bean People -- two glass-sculpture children filled with jelly beans to signify that everyone is multicolored and diverse underneath.

Score one for face-recognition software.
Face recognition -- which works by converting video images, photos or even police composites of faces into strings of numbers, then comparing them with other strings of numbers that stand for known faces -- is very much in its infancy.
It works reasonably well at confirming the identity of someone who wants to log on to a computer or pass through a security checkpoint.
But it has yet to yield consistent results in law-enforcement and surveillance settings, where, depending on lighting, the camera angle and quality, and other variables, its powers of discrimination can be more akin to Mr. Magoo's than Superman's.
And such systems are peering into more and more faces every day.
About 100 casinos across the country now use cameras hooked up to facial recognition systems to search their floors for known cheats, purse-snatchers and coin-cup swipers, according to the International Biometric Group, a consulting firm in New York.
(Face recognition is one of several types of biometric systems, which use physical measurements to identify people.)
Illinois uses it to catch people using borrowed or stolen identities applying for drivers' licenses.
A couple of dozen police departments in the United States and Canada use it as the state police in Atlantic City do, to help figure out who their suspects really are.
In West Virginia, a computer is churning through millions of Web pages a day looking for photographs of missing children.
And election officials in Mexico and Uganda are using it to prevent double voting.
Face recognition is still a tiny industry.
Only about $10 million worth of face-recognition software was sold last year, according to the International Biometric Group.

''Even if you use it to say, 'Look, I don't know who this guy is,' but instead of looking at a thousand pictures you can narrow it down to a hundred, that's a good thing,'' Mr. Wayman said.
In essence, he said, it creates a smaller haystack.
The system that Detective Boero uses runs software designed by Viisage Technology, a company in Littleton, Mass.
It works by describing faces in terms of how much they resemble each of 128 archetypal faces.
The archetypes, ghostly-looking things known as eigenfaces, have been created by combining hundreds of real faces in a databank and then using mathematical formulas to analyze similarities and differences.
Viisage's chief rival, the Visionics Corporation, based in Jersey City, uses a system called local feature analysis.
It involves plotting out the relative positions of a dozen or more points at places where the curvature of the face changes -- the features that make a face unique -- and trying to find other faces with similar constellations of critical points.
Both systems, after analyzing a face, display the stored faces that it resembles in descending order of similarity.
Under ideal conditions, most systems do a decent job of recognizing faces.
The ability to make a match also declines as time goes by and people's faces change with age.
One test, using two photos of a cooperative subject taken about a year apart under somewhat different lighting, found that the Visionics system, generally the best performer of the five systems in the tests, picked the correct person out of a file of 227 faces only 55 percent of the time.

But many mug shot files include tens of thousands of images, so a face could appear thousands of images from the top of the list and still be in the top 10 percent.

Software makers note that surveillance cameras taking 30 frames a second offer many chances to match an image.
But a test using people walking past a video camera (without looking straight at it) found that even the best systems ranked the correct person first in a field of 165 images only about 35 percent of the time.
It is little wonder, then, that many customers who were expecting miracles from their face-recognition systems, which can cost anywhere from $15,000 to many times that, have been disappointed.
But the system has not solved any more cases, said Sergeant Bill Conley.
Capt.
Face-recognition technology works best when it gets a lot of help -- in places like casinos, where hundreds of cameras monitor the well-lighted floors and guards can pan, tilt and zoom to get a good shot.
The biggest face-recognition installation in public space is in Newham, a rough neighborhood in London's East End.
There, 300 security cameras are trained on the borough's five main shopping areas, and at any time, images from 10 of the cameras are being fed into a face-recognition system.
When the system spots any of 100 or so local hoodlums, an alarm goes off in a monitoring room; if warranted, an officer will be dispatched to trail or question the person.
Newham officials credit the system with a 30 percent drop in crime.
But even in Newham, face recognition has not led to any arrests.
Rather, said Bob Lack, the official in charge of the system, criminals have heard about the system and taken their business elsewhere.
While Mr.
To the extent that the technology does work, civil libertarians worry that it will enhance the government's ability to spy on its residents.
The police are not allowed to stop someone on the street for no reason and demand identification, but face recognition could in effect allow them to do just that, said Barry Steinhardt, the associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
''It's a wonderful tool for police who want to film a demonstration and compare faces to drivers' licenses,'' he said.
For every Orwellian scenario that facial recognition conjures, however, there is a potential benefit.
George Davis, the program director of Anser, a nonprofit group that uses the technology to search the Web (unsuccessfully, so far) for images of missing children, said that a federal agency was interested in his proposal to search seized child pornography videos or photos for missing children or for adults from sex-offender registries.
It would not be a big stretch, Mr. Davis said, to pass legislation creating a database of photos of all the parents in the country who are suspected of abducting their children, then comparing those photos to drivers' license records.
''You do that, you find half the missing kids in the country,'' he said.
''It will certainly be more accurate in the future,'' he said.
''There's only one way it can go.''
But it is not clear whether sentiment has truly changed.
Stocks may have fallen just because they had risen so sharply that any negative news could trip them up.

The Dow fell 80.03 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,796.65.
The Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, dropped 74.4 points, or 3.4 percent, to 2,146.20.
The four-week moving average of claims is now at the highest level since the fall of 1992.
William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, said the claims data ''definitely shows you that the labor market is deteriorating, and that makes you more worried about consumer spending.''
He is predicting that the unemployment rate in April rose to 4.5 percent while there was a decline of 100,000 payroll jobs.

While Goldman is not predicting a recession, it is expecting the economy to be softer for longer than some other forecasters.
And Mr. Dudley said it would not take much to change his forecast to a recession.
Although growth in the first part of the year has been stronger than analysts thought, some still think that a recession is possible because of the effect of layoffs.
If they continue to increase, these analysts argue, consumer confidence will decline as more workers lose their jobs and other realize that they have a friend or a relative who has been laid off.
That would lead to a reduction in consumer spending large enough to start a recession.
Fed policy makers made a surprise cut of half a percentage point in short-term interest rates on March 18 and are expected to cut again when they meet on May 15.
Mr. Dudley said he thought that Fed policy makers were worried ''that things could break,'' which means they might make another half-point cut, which would bring the short-term interest rate target to 4 percent.
A weak jobs report today would improve odds for a half-point reduction.
At the same time, Mr. Dudley said there were some positive signs, including how far along the adjustment of inventories has gone.
This decline indicates that the slowdown that has already pushed the country's manufacturing sector into a recession is spreading.

Adding to the negative news in the economic data are the almost daily reports of layoffs.
Yesterday, Newell Rubbermaid, the maker of Calphalon cookware and Levolor blinds, said it would cut 3,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its work force, over the next three years.
Vitesse Semiconductor said it would cut 12 percent of its work force and reduce executive salaries.
The once-robust labor market has been weakening since last spring, but most of the weakness had been focused on manufacturing employees and on temporary workers, many of them also employed in manufacturing.
Now there is clear evidence that job-cutting has spread through the vast service sector as well.

''The weakness in the economy is no longer a manufacturing story or a high-tech story,'' said William Dudley, director of domestic economic research at Goldman, Sachs.
''It is much more broadly based.''
The stock market, however, treated the bad news as pointing to better times ahead.
[Page C1.]
The employment report also seemed to practically guarantee another half-point cut in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet on May 15.
Falling rates usually encourage people to invest in stocks by reducing the return on alternative investments.
''Business is biting the bullet, quickly cutting labor costs, and the markets see this as good news for stock prices,'' said James Glassman, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan.
Not everyone shares that optimism.
Rising unemployment is particularly hard on consumer confidence, and the unemployment rate is now the highest since October 1998.
The concern is that rising unemployment will make consumers pull back, weakening the economy even more and raising the unemployment rate yet another notch or two.
''The risk is that we are going to get caught in a vicious circle, with rising unemployment leading to cutbacks in spending which lead to further job losses,'' Mr. Dudley said.
Most of the economic weakness so far has come from companies spending much less for machinery, computers and software.
The Fed's aggressive rate cuts -- two percentage points since early January -- and still respectable consumer spending might be reviving the economy, some Wall Street economists said.
''The job numbers tell us that the second quarter is going to be weaker than the first quarter, although we might still be able to avoid a recession,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis.

Under pressure from shrinking profits, corporate America appears to be shifting its strategy for cutting labor costs.
The April report offered the first clear evidence that employers were resorting more frequently now to layoffs and hiring freezes.

''Now they are losing that reluctance and layoffs are becoming fashionable.''
The shift is reflected in the unemployment data.
''The flow of new people into unemployment is clearly rising,'' said Thomas Nardone, chief of the division that compiles the job figures at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The Bush Administration viewed the latest jobs report as a justification for the $1.3 billion tax cut that Congress seems on the verge of adopting.
''We need to give the economy room to breath and the first essential step is the president's tax cut,'' Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao said.
All of the Labor Department's numbers are seasonally adjusted to offset employment trends that might otherwise distort the figures.
That is, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates how many jobs should have been created in April in a normal year -- 895,000, in fact, and since only 672,000 showed up in the surveys of business payrolls, that counted as a job loss of 223,000.
What validates this process, Mr. Nardone says, are the trends, and the trend has been downward -- from an average of 256,000 new jobs created each month in the first four months of last year to a monthly decline, on average, of 14,000 in the same period this year.

As the labor market has weakened, wage pressures have subsided.
That is half the black rate of 8.2 percent, which fell slightly.
College graduates are also being hit, in part because of the devastation in the dot-com world.
Their unemployment rate rose in March and April and, at 2.3 percent, is now six-tenths of a percentage point above its level a year ago.
''The slowdown,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, ''is bringing layoffs across the board.''
Their answers, excerpted below, included the usual suspects, like the consumer confidence index, which measures the population's feelings and expectations.

There is a rich history to the search for the right economic tea leaf.
''The economy is extraordinarily complex,'' Mr. Colander said.
''Once in a while, it stays smooth and has patterns.
And if it stays smooth for awhile, you get a false sense of security that you think you understand it.''
In recent years, as the economy has changed in character, Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has been known to review reams of data, from corrugated-box sales to a little-watched corporate debt rate.
He also relies on one of the oldest data-gathering techniques, one that many chief executives appear to like: talking to people and asking them what they see.
For the moment, the executives seem to be split into two camps.
The optimists are paying close attention to consumers and, as a result, think that the economy will probably avoid a recession.
The pessimists, meanwhile, see gloom in the corporate sector.
MICHAEL D. EISNER -- Chairman and chief executive, the Walt Disney Company.
I would say that we look at the consumer confidence numbers that come out and we look at the advance reservations at our parks in Tokyo, Europe and Florida.
And I have always been a believer in talking to people about classified advertising.
Help-wanted ads are usually a good indicator of the economy.
The best indicator we have is the number of investment bankers that call in bad times.
In bad times we get five times as many calls from bankers with ideas about what to buy.
They want action because their business is bad.
They are motivated to get things done so that their companies will have fees and make money.
So we find that our strategic investing calls increase.
And right now a lot of people are calling.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Our reservations are O.K.
They are a little softer than last year but stronger than 1999.
So it is not that the sky is falling, but we do see some softness.
Consumer confidence is tied to picking up the phone and making reservations.
My personal point of view of a recession: I don't personally think it is going to go on that long.
I don't think it is going to be as long as people think.
But I just don't know.
Alan Greenspan is the guy to call.
JACQUES NASSER -- Chief executive and president, the Ford Motor Company.
We've consistently undercalled our industry's demand, and I think this is an indication of how resilient the economy has become.
But it's also very clear that there is an economic slowdown well under way.
We look at capital investment; we look at business sentiment indices, including purchasing managers' indices.
We also have some internal indicators that we look at: for example, Hertz with car rentals, both on the leisure side and the business side of the equation.
Hertz, as you also know, has equipment rentals, primarily for construction but also for other equipment.
That's an early indicator as well.
We also look at the commercial end of the truck market, which is a fairly good long-term indicator as well.
Readings on consumer confidence, we think, are vital also, because not only do they provide advance signals about developments in the job market but they also translate into consumers' expectations about their own personal financial situation.
On a more sort of fundamental basis, we read and interpret Federal Reserve policy, about what the interaction is going to be.
The level of interest rates is obviously important in determining the economy's performance, particularly if you're looking out beyond, say, six or nine months.
Hertz really revolves around two businesses.
One is the business sector, and two is travel, leisure travel.
When businesses are pulling back, or there is a slowdown, you get reduced travel.
So that's a pretty good indicator actually.
That was a signal we would see further weakening as the year rolls by, and I think we're starting to see that.
BRUCE CHIZEN -- Chief executive and president, Adobe Systems.
We look at the weekly sell-through of our products [products purchased] and listen to what our customers are saying.
The other, more anecdotal thing I look at is, when I travel to different cities, I look at taxicab lines, traffic and activity in the evening -- in other words, how crowded the restaurants and bars and entertainment destinations are.
In Japan, when I go out with partners and customers, I go into the karaoke bars and see how crowded they are.
When I see the taxi lines are relatively short, the bars and restaurants are easy to get into and not crowded, and there's not as much traffic, that all signals to me that the economy is hurting.
I wasn't paying that much attention to it.
I take that as a good sign.
That's reflected in our business.
Our Asian business continues to perform very well.
In the Bay Area, I jog a few times every week.
I've noticed a doubling and, in some cases, tripling of the homes for sale.
I also noticed, for the first time in many years, real estate signs saying, ''Price Reduced.''
That is a major concern I have about not only real estate, but the overall economy.
ROBERT A. ECKERT -- Chairman and chief executive, Mattel.
Despite the incredible strength of the U.S. economy over the last decade or so, the fact is the economy is still cyclical.
This recent expansion was longer and stronger than normal and the current slowdown, or even contraction, shouldn't be a surprise.
The toy industry has historically been less sensitive to economic downturns than some other industries.
The reality is that growth in the toy industry is much more sensitive to product innovation.
At the end of the day, a parent or grandparent will still spend $10 or $15 on a Barbie doll for their child's birthday.
I look at a lot of statistics, but because we are a manufacturer of consumer goods -- toys -- the two most relevant indicators to our industry are consumer confidence and retail sales trends across all categories.
I also look at employment trends.
It's not rocket science -- people who are employed feel better about their prospects, and have more disposable income to spend.
Within the toy industry, I track closely the NPD sales data [an industry indicator], which tells me people are buying toys.
This is the slowest time for toys, but the good news is, despite the slowing economy, the toy industry is holding up nicely.

LEO F. MULLIN -- Chairman and chief executive, Delta Air Lines.
What happens in the airline business is that you can get a little bit of a lag with respect to the impact of an economic slowdown.
But then as soon as businesses begin to realize what is happening, it can be a very precipitous reaction.
Travel is viewed as one of the more discretionary items.
We saw that kind of precipitous decline take place in the first quarter and we see that definitely continuing into the second quarter.
The leisure business is holding up somewhat better.
It is the businesses who react most strongly and swiftly to the economy.
Our core shuttle markets from Boston to New York and New York to Washington are a perfect example.
What we look at ourselves, in terms of future indicators, is advance bookings.
It is not what I would call a great economic indicator, but it is a pretty good financial indicator for a couple of months anyway.
The third month out it gets a little weak.

Our advance bookings in May, June and July are between 3 1/2 and 5 percent down from last year.
At least half of that is related to Delta's labor issues and the fact that we have suffered some booking-away problems because of that.
Interestingly, by July, advanced bookings are down between 1 and 2 percent so it looks somewhat better.
But I think that July is the weaker indicator.
What I would take from all of this is continuing substantial economic weakness in the second quarter and the expectation of some improvement in the third quarter.
But if you look at the whole year, it is just going to be a very tough year for our airline and airlines in general.
CHRISTOPHER GALVIN -- Chairman and chief executive, Motorola.
It is clear to us that segments of the telecommunications and semiconductor industry are definitely in a recession.
The indicator to watch is order growth for telecom equipment, which has fallen in the range of 10 to 40 percentage points over the past three to four months.
Order growth today is negative, and inventories for the industry are still climbing in many places.
We do not feel that the U.S. economy is currently in a recession.
What remains uncertain is whether the economy may still slip into a recession.
I would put the chances at about 50-50.
The economic problems in the U.S. are starting to spill over into rest of world's high-tech industries, somewhat in Europe and less so in Asia.
At the same time, with the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, and a tax cut on the horizon, we would hope to see, barring unforeseen circumstances, the U.S. economy return to a ''normal'' growth path by late this year or early 2002.
We believe the telecom industry, as measured by capital expenditures, will return gradually to positive territory early next year.
The problem is the inventory overhang.
The industry, however, will work through that issue.

J. T. BATTENBERG III -- Chairman, chief executive and president, Delphi Automotive Systems.
I am beginning to see some leveling out of economic trends.
I basically look at six different criteria, and then a couple that are kind of specific to our industry.
On a macro level, the first thing I look at every month is the consumer confidence.
That drives so much in the auto industry.
The consumer confidence has dropped, but it's beginning to certainly level off, at a much lower level -- but nevertheless it is beginning to level off.
I also look at the National Association of Purchasing Management's purchasing agents index, and that, too, had a precipitous drop for the last eight months, actually 10 months.
But it has leveled off somewhat in the last couple of months.
And then I look at the North American seasonally adjusted annual rate [of vehicle sales], and that looks again to be leveling off from a pretty precipitous drop.
Personal savings have never been this low and debt has never been this high.
So those I watch, and there are slight bends in the curves relative to both of those indicators.
Probably the single most important thing that I pay attention to on a regular basis is the days of inventory and the actual field inventory in the car industry.
And focusing on North America, if you go back a year ago, the North American days of inventory were running in the 60, 61, 62 area month after month, which is pretty healthy, the range being 45 to 73 or 74, depending on the original equipment manufacturer.
March was down to a 60 average again, 60 days of inventory for the industry in North America, back to where it was a year ago, which is encouraging.
J.W.
MARRIOTT JR. -- Chairman and chief executive, Marriott International.
Our business is driven largely by the technology companies and pharmaceutical companies.
Business has spiked the last seven to eight years because of the strong technology industry.
But we have seen a drop-off in business travel the last few months because technology companies have cut back.
I look at the Nasdaq.
I think it is a good indicator of how investment companies view a comeback of the technology sector.
A comeback in technology would lead to more travel.
And business travel is the biggest market segment in our business.
I also pay attention to consumer confidence, which affects the leisure part of travel.
Consumer spending is driving the economy.
This is a very strange downturn, because auto sales have been strong and unemployment is low and housing sales are good.
But technology has been low and those are our big customers.
Company investment and spending on technology generates a lot of travel.
Thirty-five percent of our business is made up of conventions and groups, 45 percent transient business travel and about 20 percent leisure travel.

ALAN LACY -- Chairman and chief executive, Sears, Roebuck & Company.
At the moment, we anticipate the second quarter to be slow, and we're cautious about the second half of the year.
There have been interest-rate cuts, which are terrific, but the consumer is concerned about gas prices and job cuts.
We have not seen any real signs of improvement.
Things that are not being promoted, they're not buying.
If it's not discounted, they're not buying.
What we often see is the consumer is only responding to the item on sale.
I think March sales were as weak as people can recall.
We're a broad-line retailer.
On the hard-line side, housing turnover is a good indicator.
New construction and resales -- we look at the combination.
When people move into a new home, they buy new appliances.
The soft side is affected by weather and style, so that is difficult.
We have a better leading indicator in hard-line items -- appliances, washers, dryers, refrigerators, ranges.
We knew it would slow.
But this year, it's quicker than we anticipated.
When people are still worried about energy and worried about job loss, it's difficult.
SCOTT COOK -- Chairman of the executive committee, Intuit.
When you're doing things like taxes and accounting, people are going to have to do that regardless of what's going on with the economy.
But there is one indicator, or driver, that I look at: a tax cut.
One, the tax cut enriches consumers so they buy more; and two, the complexity and change in the tax cut cause more people to go out and buy TurboTax.
Which certainly enriches us.
JOSEPH GALLI Jr. -- Chief executive and president, Newell Rubbermaid.
There is a lot of inventory at retail and there is a slower sell-through environment.
At Newell Rubbermaid we look at broader G.N.P.
measures, we look for overall retail trends, comparable store sales -- things that indicate overall retail activity.
This is a unique and difficult time.

We are going to have a large group of people that will be deployed at retail stores.
Their primary job will be to merchandise our products, but an important part of their responsibility is to keep their antennae up and identify trends in spending.
That can be product-specific trends or macroeconomic trends.
When you have that presence at store level you don't get surprised, you don't have things creep up on you that you should have seen coming.
KENNETH LEWIS -- Chairman, chief executive and president, the Bank of America Corporation.
The U.S. economy will remain in the midst of an uneven economic slowdown, in which capital spending and profits will continue to decline sharply while consumer spending and housing will continue to grow.
While pockets of weakness exist, the Federal Reserve's rapid and decisive easing of monetary policy points to rebounding demand in the second half of the year.
Bank of America's activities illustrate the resilience of the economy: our consumer credit quality remains healthy, consumer deposits continue to increase, mortgage activity is robust and many of our capital markets efforts continue to enjoy healthy growth.
PATRICIA F. RUSSO -- President and chief operating officer, the Eastman Kodak Company.
I look at several things to see which way the economy is moving.
Housing starts are always a good indicator of the general economy.
Auto sales tell me whether people are feeling confident enough to buy new cars.
And I pay a lot of attention to sales at mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart.
These are the places that reflect the habits of a broad swath of consumers, much more so than sales at pricey places like Bendel's.
I even look at Home Depot -- at the beginning of a downturn, people may decide to renovate themselves, instead of hiring a contractor or buying a new house.
When housing starts are low and Home Depot sales are falling, too, it's a gauge that things are getting worse, not turning around.
GLEN A. BARTON -- Chairman and chief executive, Caterpillar.
Lower interest rates bode well for Caterpillar.
These, coupled with tax-cut legislation, should result in the economy improving in the last half of this year.
This would positively impact our business in the latter part of 2001 and into the following years.
We closely monitor several key economic indicators, including housing starts, commodity prices, highway construction and energy prices.
HENRY A. McKINNELL -- Chairman and chief executive, Pfizer.
The key economic indicator at the moment is consumer confidence.
Industrial spending has clearly collapsed.
Consumers are still doing all right but there is a degree of nervousness.
I think we're going to go through a period of low to no economic growth.
But with a tax cut and with time for the interest-rate reductions to have an effect, I think we'll see an improvement in six to nine months.

DONNY DEUTSCH -- Chairman and chief executive, Deutsch Inc., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Running an advertising agency, you get a great looking glass out at the economy.
I look at the health of my clients' businesses, whether it's Domino's or Mitsubishi.
They are all healthy businesses, but they are handling things in a tougher way.
Cars, pharmaceuticals, banks -- people are cautiously optimistic.
I haven't seen clients cutting budgets.
There is business to be had, but it's not a gravy train anymore.
In the next 18 months we'll see the economy heading in the right direction; the strong will survive.
The big thing is who's in the White House -- people vote with their pocketbooks.
We have a Republican administration, which is obviously quite committed to using every catalyst possible to stimulate the economy.
We have the right engine in the White House -- much more aggressive in terms of tax cuts, and it's given consumers permission to think that there is a new wind blowing.
I project the next six months will gradually go in the right direction, then 12 to 18 months after that, really start to head in the right direction.
The worst is behind us.
The inner journey is often a perilous one.

But even if I do not have to worry about my superabundant energy overflowing inadequate containers (if only I did!
), stepping out of life can be disorienting.
It can even seem a little humiliating, especially in New York City, with the busy world streaming past my windows.
She only works three days a week, but her presence has made me awkwardly aware of just what my writing day looks like.
Our nanny's husband is a welder and works outdoors in all kinds of weather.
What does she think when she sees me, a grown man who goes to work in his bedroom slippers?
Or when I wander out of my little room at midday, while my daughter is taking a nap, to lie on the couch with a book?
Or if I sit by the window staring out for a while?
Or if the need to figure out a certain scene or a certain sentence -- or the need to escape from a certain scene or a certain sentence -- drives me from my desk over to, say, a box of cereal for a late-morning snack.
On days when I'm really diligent, I might even take a nap, not unlike my daughter who, after 12 hours at night, still needs a little supplementary sleep to feel refreshed.
Play, after all, is hard work; Anna Freud called play the work of children.
And perhaps of writers, too.
Play is work; inside is outside; indolence is activity.
One might add that the imaginary is real, and introspection is actually a form of social research.
No wonder I have to take a nap from time to time.
Eventually one must put aside the paradoxes and the explanations and simply write.
But even then I find that the paradoxes make their way into the writing.
''The Talmud and the Internet,'' my most recent book, despite its title and subject, wound up having at its core a description of my two grandmothers.
The best I could do was put them side by side and, in the manner of the Talmud, let them each stand as point and counterpoint, neither dissolving into the other.
I let my grandmothers take their place alongside all the famous figures in my book, Talmud sages and great writers and historical figures, because without that personal element my public speculations seemed weirdly abstract.
There's always a piece of writing that for me must be close to home, the string that binds the balloon to the earth.

I was at some level as embarrassed to find myself writing about my grandmothers as I was to find myself writing about a self-starving woman.
What were my grandmothers doing in the middle of everything, calling me home?
The wonderful thing about writing is that it forces you to confront yourself in a way you don't usually have to.
That is, needless to say, also the terrible thing.
Well, as Jorge Luis Borges wrote, ''The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges.''
This is a universal problem, not a literary one.
Everybody has to find his own voice, whether or not he is a writer.
This is why all the arcane things a writer discovers about his craft aren't really arcane.
Everybody has to make the inner descent into himself, everybody needs metaphors to live by, and everybody has to order the chaos of experience into some kind of narrative, if only in the depths of dream-fashioning sleep.
In that regard, the writer who stays home is really a kind of everyman.
There should be more novels about him.

He is also something of an immigrant himself, exploring the world and groping for the words that will help him master it.
And staying at home has taught me something else: my daughter is a kind of immigrant, too.
I hear her as I write this; she is in her highchair in the kitchen, just outside my door, being fed her lunch.
She is learning to say brief truncated words: ''nana'' for banana; ''mih'' for milk.
Soon enough she will know my language so well that the physical world she is on such intimate terms with may seem abstract, reaching her through a muffling amnion of mediating words.
Inevitably my home is becoming a sort of melting pot for my daughter.
She cannot go through life yanking the phone off the hook, pointing at things and screaming if she doesn't get them.
She cannot (very important) push open the door of my maid's room whenever she wants.
And though this process of assimilation is necessary, it has a small element of sadness in it for me.
Because I so love her untutored, marveling attitude to the world.
I love her deep attachment to sunlight, the way she pokes the water in her bathtub to test its properties, the way she gapes at the mystery of a face, laughing in amazement.
''Not in entire fogetfulness and not in utter nakedness but trailing clouds of glory do we come,'' Wordsworth wrote.
On earth we learn a new language.
But if we manage to keep the trace of an accent from the mysterious place we once inhabited, so much the better for us.
Certainly all my favorite writers have retained their attitude of wonder.
And I think this matters to me most about writing, beyond history and politics, plot and structure, the literal and symbolic.
Of course one wants all those things, too.
But there is something much more primitive and simple and elusive that lies at the core of writing that has to do with the sheer mystery of the created world.
For me it is what links a cave painting to a page of ''Ulysses.''
Perhaps it is the need to approach this mystery that explains why I am a grown man who stays home with the nanny when other people are going to work.
And why, as I sit in the maid's room proudly overhearing my daughter speak her first words in my language, I find myself hoping I will capture a few forgotten elements of hers.

This article is part of a series in which writers explore literary themes.

On album, Goldfrapp is languorous and spell-binding, bringing together the smoky noir trip-hop of Portishead, the analog electronic perfectionism of Air and the ethereal filmic arrangements of Julee Cruse and Angelo Badalamenti.
But it is music that succeeds by such a delicate margin, balancing between beauty and lameness, between originality and uninventiveness.
A bad live show could ruin it all.
Armed with three microphones (one fed through vocal processing effects, another for less treated singing and a third that sent her voice into a mini-Moog to be played by Mr. Gregory), Ms. Goldfrapp, dressed like a 40's international spy, sang in a seductive deadpan, breaking character occasionally for piercing soprano melismas.
The band also favored high pitches -- piercing Moog themes, whistling melodies, eerily bowed cymbals and squealing electric violin -- used in spacious arrangements that owed a clear debt to songs like ''God Only Knows'' by the Beach Boys, ''Man With a Harmonica'' by Ennio Morriccone and ''Goldfinger'' by John Barry.
Ms. Goldfrapp, who prior to releasing her first album sang on recordings by Tricky and Orbital, held herself with careful, menacing poise.
Her stance was evidence of a confidence that exists solely as a mask for a lack of confidence.
She stood to the side of the stage in contemplation -- to be a diva or not to be a diva -- before opting for the latter and continuing the show.

Goldfrapp appears to be a band that has good nights and bad ones.
Until the encore.
Probably no one is as hard on Goldfrapp as Ms. Goldfrapp is.

To the Editor:
You report (front page, May 5) that ''prompted by water restrictions and fed up with the demands of keeping a rectangle in crew cut, perpetual green, even some homeowners in famously rainy parts of the country are giving up on the traditional lawn.''
There is one more boon of abandoning the lawn that you do not mention: an end to the perpetual drone of mowers and blowers that make the stillness of the countryside but a sad memory.
H. KONING
Southport, Conn., May 7, 2001
Kentucky normally produces about 10,000 thoroughbred foals each year, accounting for one-third of the thoroughbreds born in the country.
It is now estimated that the state's breeding industry may suffer more than a 30 percent reduction in the number of horses born in 2002.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Since April 28, 371 aborted or stillborn fetuses have been brought into the Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center at the University of Kentucky for examination.
The total is six or seven times higher than the number usually seen this time of year, veterinarians say.
The ripple effects may be felt for years.
Stallion owners typically collect fees only when a foal stands and nurses, meaning millions in ''live foal'' stud fees will go uncollected.
Middlemen like Mr. Bandoroff, who in addition to boarding mares, helps arrange the sale of young, unraced horses, will now have fewer horses to sell.
Bloodstock agents, who buy and sell horses, and feed producers will be affected, too.
And racetracks may also feel a hit, since the sport is struggling with a longstanding horse shortage -- due partly to the fact that horses no longer run as often -- that has produced small fields unpopular with racing fans.
''The concerns are pretty serious,'' said Edmond Hogan, owner of Gauls town Stud, a 140-acre farm 12 miles west of Lexington, Ky. ''You're looking at the loss of the foals that were going to be born this year and sold in September, as well as those to be born next year.
And there are the losses to stallion owners.
We don't know if this is going to be the tip of the iceberg, or if it will taper off.
It's just a guessing game.''
Mr. Hogan houses about 50 mares for clients alongside the five mares that he owns.
One of the most prominent stallion farms in the country, Taylor Made, expects to lose 50 percent of the fees it would get for breeding its stallions, or about $16.5 million, said Ben Taylor, vice president for stallion management at the farm, which is near Nicholasville, Ky.

Under many contracts made between those who own mares and those who own stallions, a stallion owner is paid the breeding fee if the foal is born relatively healthy.
That fee can range from $1,000 to $400,000 depending on the quality of the horse, and a breeding stallion usually impregnates 20 to 150 mares a year.
One of Taylor Made's stallions, Saint Ballado, gets $125,000 for siring a live foal.
The 1,600-acre farm breeds six stallions and houses 400 mares for various clients.
Breeders often take out insurance on their expected foals, but many of the underwriters are canceling their policies in light of the deaths.
There is concern among farm managers that fears of Kentucky pastures will remain long after the problem is resolved.
The farm manager, Dan Rosenberg, said, ''That's news to me.''
''The worst thing we can do is panic,'' he added.
There are two kinds of cases showing up among the afflicted mares, said Dr. David Powell, an equine epidemiologist at the Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky.
The first is with mares who are at or near full term in their 11-month pregnancy.
In these cases, the placenta is coming out of the mare's womb before the foal, causing the foal to suffocate if immediate steps are not taken.

In other cases, foals are being spontaneously aborted 40 to 70 days into pregnancy.
Some of these mares can be bred again this season -- the breeding season runs from Feb. 15 to July 1 -- but others might have carried their foals too long to conceive again anytime soon.
''At this stage, we do not have a definite diagnosis as to what is causing either of these problems, but we are undertaking a very thorough investigation,'' Dr. Powell said.
The fungus secretes a mycotoxin that mimics the hormones in mares and can lead to both early and late abortions.
The same mycotoxin has apparently not affected other animals.
Some horse-feed companies are putting low levels of chemicals in their products that would help reduce the absorption of the mycotoxin.
Veterinarians are also recommending that mares be fed hay.
But the exact cause of the deaths remains a mystery, and money continues to bleed from the industry.
''We've taken grass samples, fecal samples, run tests on water, pulled blood, taken cultures on the ones that have aborted or the foals who have come out dead,'' said Duncan Taylor, president of Taylor Made Farm.
''Unless the scientists come up with something, they can have all the meetings they want and it's not going to help.
You want to think the worst of it is over, but that's just a guess.''
PRODUCTIVITY is not what it was cracked up to be.
And therein lies one of the great fallacies of the recent boom and bubble.
Productivity -- at least as measured by the government -- zoomed in recent years, rising at a faster rate than at any time since the 1960's.
Now productivity is falling, and Mr.
Chambers is coping with a collapse in demand that he did not see coming and still cannot quite believe.
This week he was still talking of Cisco returning to a 30 percent to 50 percent annual growth rate when the economy recovers.
But the failure of the productivity measures to show big gains in other areas should have been telling.
asked Greg Jensen, an analyst at Bridgewater Associates.
There is no way to know just how much a tighter Fed would have been able to slow the expansion of the bubble, but it would have had some effect.
Less money would have been wasted on unproductive investments, of which Cisco's $2.2 billion inventory write-down is but a small part.
Think of the money invested in absurd dot-coms, as well as fiber optic lines that are installed but may never be used.

''Now we see a contraction of the ability of good companies to get money, because of all the money the bad companies sucked in,'' Mr. Jensen said.
Instead, we must deal with the effects of a bust in capital investment, one that is likely to continue for some time.
We will learn that productivity was probably really growing at a slower rate than we thought, and will continue to do so.
That implies slower economic growth and lower multiples for earnings in the stock market.
There are historical precedents.
''Productivity growth does not necessarily presage heaven on earth,'' James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, said.
Productivity booms are not permanent things.
AT&T Broadband, which would be a tracking stock at first and later be converted to an independent company, includes AT&T's $100 billion expansion into the cable TV business during the last few years as well as the company's stake in Excite@Home, a provider of high-speed Internet access and operator of the Excite Internet portal.
It would be burdened with $28.4 billion in long-term debt, 44 percent of AT&T's total, reflecting the money borrowed when AT&T was buying cable operations.
That debt, which represents figures at the end of last year, has already been reduced by asset sales this year and is set to be reduced even more when AT&T sells its interest in Time Warner Entertainment, probably to AOL Time Warner.
AT&T plans to first sell a part of AT&T Broadband in an initial public offering and then spin off the rest to AT&T shareholders.
One unanswered question is where the money raised by the offering will go -- to the AT&T parent or to the broadband company to reduce its debt.
The consumer tracking stock is intended to reflect AT&T's residential long-distance business, its WorldNet Internet access provider and a small effort to provide high-speed Internet access over digital subscriber lines, known as D.S.L.
operation by buying assets from the bankrupt Northpoint Communications.

The consumer company now has just $4 billion of AT&T's debt, or 6 percent of the total debt, but accounted for $18.9 billion of revenue, or 29 percent of the total revenue.
The consumer stock is expected to receive the bulk of the dividends paid by AT&T, reflecting the fact that it is not a growing business and is expected to attract investors largely by offering current income.
AT&T Business, will include what is left of AT&T, including networking and communications services to large companies.
It will be the legal owner of the company's brand and will license it to other AT&T entities.
Because the consumer operations will be a tracking stock of AT&T, those assets will effectively also secure the AT&T business debt, even though AT&T shareholders will no longer share in the profits of the consumer operations.
The final business is AT&T Wireless, now a tracking stock.
It, too, will become a separate company.

AT&T is in the midst of an exchange offer allowing AT&T shareholders to swap their shares for shares in AT&T Wireless.
When that exchange offer is completed, AT&T will keep $3 billion in Wireless stock, presumably to sell and provide cash to pay down the debt of AT&T Business.
And AT&T will distribute the rest of the shares to AT&T shareholders as part of the reorganization.
The difference represents intercompany revenue, like when Wireless paid money to AT&T for using its long-distance lines.
Worried about the uncertain direction of the economy and about how much further interest rates may fall, investors spent much of last week on the sidelines, awaiting this week's meeting of the Federal Reserve.
A rate cut is still expected, but robust retail sales and improving consumer confidence fed investor worries that this could be the last cut for a while.
That feeling was reinforced by a report showing that productivity fell in the first quarter, driving up labor costs.
Technology stocks fared even worse, with the Nasdaq falling to 2,107.43, down 84.1 points, or 3.8 percent.
The Dow Jones industrials also slipped, finishing at 10,821.31, down 129.93, or 1.2 percent.
Those moves, coupled with the concerns about rate cuts, undermined Treasury prices.

There have been previous investigations in 1993 and 1998 by the Pension and Health Fund of Mr. Christy and the producers, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler.
The 1993 inquiry was settled out of court one year later for an undisclosed sum, according to union officials.
''I should say there is such a thing as the cutting-room floor,'' he said, explaining why he might not have actually appeared in some films.
More recently, he has refused to comment and referred all calls to the paper.
''It's a confidential, internal matter -- that's how we're treating it,'' Ms. Miller said.
I've always worked in the interest of the paper and the company, and my record speaks for itself.''
''One professional ethical standard has to be applied uniformly,'' Ms. Busch said.
In some ways, the Christy controversy reflects the rise of a newer generation of journalists who, like Ms. Busch, Mr. Robb, Ms. Laski and others, find studio- and network-paid trips unacceptable and expensive gifts wrong.
(The publicity chief at one film company said, however, that some journalists ask him at Christmas to send gifts to their homes, not their offices).

Over the years, the give and take between studios and journalists has changed radically in some ways and not so radically in others.

''You'd be able to walk into a studio and go to the commissary and sit right down and have lunch with Gable or Bogart or Duke Wayne,'' said Jim Bacon, who has been covering Hollywood for 53 years.
''We were making legends out of them.
Can you imagine something comparable happening today?
No way.''
The rise of investigative reporting and the sheer numbers of television and magazine journalists vying to cover entertainment has changed the field.
The use of independent publicity representatives like Pat Kingsley and Leslee Dart of PMK Publicity who, essentially, shield movie and television stars from the media, has also created a less accommodating atmosphere and led to a certain hostility between public relations executives and journalists, although the end product -- favorable coverage -- often is pretty much the same.
Nowadays, she said, at Christmas it is a common practice to make gifts to charities in the name of journalists.
But there are throwbacks to the old days, too.
Cozy relationships still exist among stars and their publicists, on the one hand, and writers.
Magazine writers are given access by stars and their publicity aides because they gain reputations for writing favorable accounts and not probing too deeply.
Junkets for new films -- in which air fare and hotel bills are paid by studios -- are commonplace, although some publications insist on picking up the bill.
Similarly, in television, the twice-a-year ''press tour'' for journalists and critics at the glitzy Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel and Spa in Pasadena -- where the stars and creators of new and old shows are introduced over several weeks -- is viewed mostly as excessive and even wasteful by television executives.
Although hotel bills and air fare are not paid by the networks, the networks do pick up the tabs for publicity events, including food and party bills, that can reach as much as $400,000.
Television executives say they are seeking alternatives.

Bonds had responded positively to three of the previous four rate cuts, with prices rising and yields consequently declining across the board.
That is what gives investors confidence these days.
''They will not quit,'' said Christine A. Callies, chief United States investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, ''until they achieve success in turning around capital spending and compensating for the negative wealth effect'' undermining consumer spending.
She was citing two of the three factors that Fed policy makers said continue ''to weigh on the economy'' -- the third being the risk of slower economic growth abroad.
But Ms. Callies also said she ''would not be surprised to see short-term stagnation in the stock indexes.''
The latest rate cut comes at a time when both stock and bond investors seem to believe that the central bank will be able to engineer an economic recovery in the second half of the year.
Such sentiment is reflected in recent rises in the Nasdaq composite index, which is up more than 25 percent from its low in April, and in the rise in longer-term Treasury yields as investors prepare for the higher interest rates that would presumably come with an economic recovery.
In part, such confidence stems from the rapidity of the Fed's rate cuts and their combined force -- with the benchmark short-term rate now down 2.5 percentage points in five half-point moves starting on Jan. 3.
This is the fastest that the central bank has lowered interest rates since a combined reduction of two and a half percentage points between July 20 and Aug. 16, 1982.
While such rate cuts are expected to take months to have practical effects on the economy, the stock market in the past has recovered sooner with aggressive moves by the Federal Reserve.

The economic data, though, have not yet confirmed that a recovery is in place, and the rising number of layoffs points to a risk of the economy's slowing further before it recovers.
The unemployment rate is now 4.5 percent, up from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent six months earlier.

''The Fed is very worried about the economic outlook'' said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, ''because they are not precluding a further rate cut.''
''It seems unlikely that such signs would appear,'' Mr. Lipsky said, adding that he is expecting another half-point cut next month.
Corporate profits, which are declining, could also keep investors off balance because the decline is likely to result in further pressure on employers to reduce costs by cutting jobs.
In the first quarter of this year, profits for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were down 6.4 percent, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
For the second quarter, Wall Street analysts forecast a decline in earnings of 11.4 percent, and then a drop of 2.9 percent in the third quarter.
If these forecasts prove correct, it would be the first three consecutive quarterly earnings declines since 1991, during the last recession.
Recent economic data confirm this mixed picture.
In addition, the economy still faces hazards like rising energy prices and fluctuating consumer confidence.

His command and mastery of his own mechanics usually make Mussina adaptable to any condition, whether he lacks control of his curveball on a given day, or the wind is gusting, or the mound in the ballpark is sloped at an acute angle.
Mussina walked Miguel Tejada with two outs in the second inning, leading to two runs.
Oakland led, 3-1, before the Yankees began to come back in the sixth, Paul O'Neill drawing a walk, Tino Martinez lining a single and Jorge Posada walking to load the bases.
David Justice drew a walk to push home a run, cutting the Athletics' advantage to 3-2.
This is how the Yankees are scoring runs these days, on bases-loaded walks and ground-ball double plays.

Mussina walked Tejada leading off the sixth, and with two outs, Ramon Hernandez whacked a double, scoring Tejada for a 4-3 lead.
The Yankees trailed by only a run through six innings.
Manager Joe Torre was determined to relieve Mussina for the seventh inning because of his mounting pitch count, and Mike Stanton began warming up in the bullpen, readying for his 20th appearance in the team's 41 games.
Eric Chavez singled to right field, one run scoring to make it 5-3, and Stanton was relieved by Todd Williams, one of the middle relievers who have not engendered the full weight of Torre's faith this year.

Over the 59 regular-season games that sandwich the last championship -- 18 games at the end of last year and the first 41 games of this season -- the Yankees are 25-34.

Investors seem confident, based on the performance of both stocks and bonds, that the Fed's rate cuts will lead to an economic recovery in the the second half of the year.
Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers, said that based on the history of Fed interest rate cuts back to the early 1970's, the stock market has reached a bottom, on average, about three months after the first rate cut.
After a fifth rate cut, he said, the main market indexes have not dropped below that bottom.
But the recovery of the technology sector, whose plunge led the stock market into bear territory, still lags that of many old-economy stocks.
While the Dow is over 11,000 again, the Nasdaq composite index, despite this week's rally, is still 4.1 percent below where it was before the first Fed rate cut on Jan. 3.

This split is also reflected in recent data of flows into equity mutual funds.
According to AMG Data Services, investors put $825 million of new money into stock funds in the week ended Wednesday.
In its first day of trading, Instinet, which is controlled by Reuters Group P.L.C., rose $3.15, or 22 percent, to $17.65 from its initial offering price of $14.50.
Brown.
The Instinet offering came as the market for initial public offerings has slowed to a crawl.
But he still says that it is significant.
''Instead of being in a downtrend, I think we are in an uptrend now,'' he said.
One of his reasons for thinking this, he said, is that it appears that a lot of the investors who shorted gold in the past, adding a lot of downward pressure on the price, are out of the market.
When shorting, an investor sells borrowed gold in hopes that the price will fall and he can buy it back at a lower price and, thus, profit.
But gold has flirted with breakouts from the doldrums before, only to fall again.
It reached $294.30 last June before falling to $256.60 in April.
The reasons for the change are varied, he said.
Today, in order to cut expenses, partnerships have expanded to about 10 doctors, requiring offices ranging from 5,000 to 15,000 square feet.

Old offices do not have the facilities for today's needs, which include additional electrical power and space for larger and more advanced equipment.
He added that changes in outpatient care have also been a factor in the new construction.
''Doctors get more money from the third-party reimbursement if they care for patients outside the hospital environment,'' Mr. Coughlan said.
''So they have moved their facilities out of the hospitals and have become big users of space.
Now we have buildings with a 30,000-square-foot dialysis center and a 17,000-square-foot occupational therapy center with an indoor swimming pool.''
Tony Fromer, a principal in the Jericho-based We're Group -- which owns and manages approximately four million square feet of office space on Long Island, including the Lake Success Quadrangle -- said his company decided about 10 years ago to convert its first building ''from standard office to medical.''
Because of the Quadrangle's ''excellent location, midway between Long Island Jewish Medical Center and North Shore University Hospital,'' the We're Group converted that three-story 62,000-square-foot office building into a Class A medical building with additional parking, high-speed Internet access, modern suites and a maintenance staff on the premises that includes mechanics.
DOCTORS are very high-maintenance people; they can't wait to have things fixed,'' Mr. Fromer said.
They are solely medical tenants.
The doctors appreciate that.
They like to refer to each other.''
''But, that is a robotics lab,'' he said.
''There are a very few employees.
The work is mostly done by computer and fed back to the hospitals.''
The new building is a duplicate of an adjacent building that was converted and renovated two years ago.
With the exception of the laboratory, there are 10 to 20 tenants in each of the four medical office buildings in the Quadrangle, Mr. Fromer said.
Rents are about $35 a square foot annually plus electricity.
In Suffolk, Tritec is constructing three new medical buildings in the 800,000-square-foot Stony Brook Technology Center, where medical tenants range from a 15,000-square-foot surgery center with 10 doctors to a 50,000-square-foot office building.

Construction is expected to begin next month on a 14,000-square-foot, one-story, $2.5 million building on a two-acre lot.
By July, construction is expected to begin on the first of two buildings on a six-acre lot.
That building will be a one-story, 27,000-square-foot, $5 million building and it is to be followed by a 45,000-square-foot, $7.5 million, two-story building.
Construction on that building is expected to begin later this year.
All three new buildings will have a below-grade level, as there is a large demand for basement storage space in medical buildings, Mr. Coughlan said.

Rents at the park are about $25 or $26 per square foot a year, plus cleaning and utilities.
The land cost is higher, since more parking is needed, and there are higher effluent discharge requirements in order to protect the groundwater drinking supply.
Medical buildings are limited to 6,000 square feet per acre while standard office buildings can be on 10,000 square feet.
The restrictions for a medical building are eased if a sewage treatment facility is located on the property.
On a 20-acre site in Farmingville, Tritec has proposed a $15 million, 90,000-square-foot medical center to be constructed on six of the acres with a sewage treatment facility.
It is bordered by four main highways, including the Long Island Expressway, and is surrounded by nine hospitals within a radius of 20 miles.
''This one we call the hole in the donut,'' Mr. Coughlan said.
There are three other buildings on the property.
Already in operation are Kindercare, an 11,000-square-foot day care center, and the newly opened 130-bed Island Rehabilitation Nursing Center for trauma patients who require long-term care.
The extended-care facility is operated by St. Charles Hospital and Rehabilitation Center and John T. Mather Memorial Hospital, both in Port Jefferson.
A 168-room Hampton Inn is under construction.
The medical center will be built in two phases.
Construction is expected to begin in the fall on a $10 million four-story, 60,000-square-foot building.
A three-story, 30,000-square-foot extension will be added, once 50 percent of the building is leased.
ANOTHER Long Island firm active in medical real estate is the Smithtown-based Damianos Realty Group.
Pelops Damianos, a principal, said that of the 1.1 million square feet of commercial rental units owned by the company, about 50 percent is medical space.
''Most is leased to solo practitioners who require about 1,300 to 10,000 square feet of space,'' he said.
''We don't have the jumbo offices.
We cater to smaller tenancy.
Because doctors are seeing more people in their office today, there is a demand for larger waiting rooms and rooms for nurse practitioners hired to take care of the larger volume.''
Damianos Realty owns two medical parks near the Port Jefferson and Stony Brook hospitals.
The complex includes 26 one-story, 5,000-square-foot colonial-style brick buildings, each with room for three or four tenants.
Rents range from $23 to $25 a square foot, plus utilities.
Its second park in the area is the Davis Professional Park, also on Route 347.

In addition, on the South Shore, Damianos is renovating a former Bell Atlantic building in Babylon, near Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip and Southside Hospital in Bay Shore.
When the doors open, Mr. Damianos said, 75 percent of the tenants in the 40,000-square-foot building are expected to be in the medical field.
When asked recently about Kram's view of him, Ali said, ''Mark Kram is a ham.''
A central theme of Kram's book is that Ali is less than he seems to be, especially as a political and social force, that he was an empty canvas upon which the uninformed painted a world idol.
But this image was so imbedded in the public consciousnesses that he's some sort of saint that it's hard to disabuse people of it.''
Kram compares Ali to the simpleton Chauncy Gardener in the novel and film ''Being There,'' whose bland, horticultural utterances were mistaken for political acuity.
In Ali's case, Kram writes, ''Seldom has a public figure of such superficial depth been more wrongly perceived.''
''Instead of being mindlessly reviled, as he was in the 60's, he is now mindlessly revered,'' Kram said.
Mia Ali, one of the former heavyweight champion's daughters, said: ''Everyone is entitled to his opinion, but he's been a great father, and he is an idol to me as much as he is to everybody.''

He inhaled anew his notes and impressions of Ali and Frazier, but writing the book came with his characteristic lack of speed, working slowly on his ancient Royal typewriter.
His writing is like an IV drip, Hirshey said.
''You'd hear the click-click-click of his typewriter, then he'd pace the floor, smoke his pipe, go back and cross out words,'' said Deford, who, like Kram, is from Baltimore.
''He could never write the 17th word without getting the 16th absolutely right.
2.
He was dismissive of the value of doing it.
A look at Kram's past articles about Ali during his boxing career show little criticism, only some nibbling at the edges of Ali's persona.
''I've always liked Ali, but the issue is that this is the way I saw him in that period, which is far from what the public ever saw,'' he said.
David Remnick, the author of ''King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of the American Hero'' (Vintage Books, October 1999), which examines Ali's early career, has a kinder assessment of Ali, although he lacked Kram's advantage of covering him during his career.
Had he been without personality, would Norman Mailer have gone to Africa to see him fight?''
''That's far too much to legitimately credit Ali with,'' Kram said.
But think about it: why isn't that enough?
Why does he have to be anything else?''
COPPER RISES.
Copper rose on speculation that a decline in interest rates would help revive sluggish demand for metals.
She has criticized the agency for promoting ''a federal nanny state.''

Timothy J. Muris, the nominee to head the Federal Trade Commission, has repeatedly said that the Clinton administration was insensitive to the economic benefits of large corporate mergers and too aggressive in bringing major monopoly cases and challenging a large airline for predatory pricing.
And John D. Graham, another Bush appointee for a senior regulatory post, has long maintained that the federal government has imposed too many onerous environmental, health and safety regulations on big business without properly calculating the financial costs of such regulations.
Dr. Graham, a Harvard professor whose research on risks has been sponsored by corporations with stakes in the outcome of regulatory debates, has maintained that exposure to low levels of dioxins, which the government classifies as a human carcinogen, may actually reduce cancer and that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate any harmful effect of residual pesticides on food.
He is expected to become the White House's senior budget official for reviewing almost every proposed federal regulation.
The approach being pursued by the Bush regulators involves a far more rigorous examination of the financial costs and benefits of regulation, one that experts predict will tip the balance of power from consumer, environmental and labor groups to businesses and will lead to a wholesale elimination of scores of rules that have prevented American companies from both growing and having more flexibility in making business decisions.
Supporters of the existing regulations say that the rules promote many benefits that are not easily quantifiable and are certain to be overlooked under such cost-benefit analyses, from protecting consumers from dangerous products to preserving the environment and limiting companies from dominating certain crucial industries like telecommunications.
But the administration is sympathetic to companies that have been deeply critical of the financial costs of such rules.
''There are those who believe cost should be no object,'' said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director and a central player in the regulatory process.
''They take the position that if an objective feels good, we should impose a regulation without regard to costs.
That's not a very realistic approach.''
While many of the Bush appointees are still awaiting confirmation, leaders of American businesses say they can already feel the different regulatory climate in Washington.
''The Bush guys have more of an understanding of the effect of regulation on the business community and on the economy.
And they are doing it while there is an energy crisis on their hands and an economy that is not doing well.''

But others say that the administration is simply repaying its campaign debts to its most important supporters.
''The big oak tree is bending all the way over,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a public advocacy group, and a senior safety regulator in the Carter administration.
''Bush is going full bore to support his industry supporters.
He wants to completely change the regulatory process to be one that supports the industry.''

Not since the Reagan administration's wholesale reversals of regulatory policies have the scales tipped so abruptly, according to lobbyists for both sides in the long-running regulatory debate.
Just as during the so-called Reagan Revolution, the deregulatory renaissance is largely a reflection of the pro-business agenda that President Bush campaigned on.
But the change is especially swift this time because Congress and the White House are controlled by the Republicans for the first time in nearly half a century.
When the legislative and executive branches of government are controlled by different parties, the regulatory agencies typically take more moderate positions as they walk a line between Congress and the White House.
This could be seen in actions ranging from the Microsoft antitrust case to enforcement of environmental regulations.
But now, many of those actions are under assault, and the shifting ground can be felt throughout the alphabet soup of Washington agencies:
*Michael K. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has been deeply skeptical of rules limiting the size of cable and broadcasting companies and of regulations that have made it hard for the regional Bell companies to enter the long-distance market without first opening their own local markets.
''I do not believe deregulation is like a dessert that you serve after people have fed on their vegetables and is a reward for the creation of competition,'' he said earlier this year.
''I believe that deregulation is instead a critical ingredient to facilitating competition, not something to be handed out after there is a substantial number of players in the market.''
*Two of the three people nominated to serve as service secretaries in the Defense Department come from military contractors, where they have advocated a greater reliance on the marketplace and contracting out for services.
The two, Gordon R. England of General Dynamics for the Navy and James G. Roche of Northrop Grumman for the Air Force -- along with other senior Pentagon officials -- have vowed to re-examine procurement practices with an eye toward accelerating the review of government contracts, reducing red tape and promoting outsourcing and the privatization of programs that should prove to be enormously beneficial to the business community.
*The president's energy policy, formulated by the White House and a group of agencies including the Interior and Energy Departments, offers conservation proposals in an effort to win over some environmental groups.
But it proposes to deliver a virtual wish list of deregulatory changes to the oil, gas and nuclear industries, which had far less influence in the prior administration.
The case of Ms. Gall to head the Consumer Product Safety Commission is perhaps the strongest illustration of the policy shift.
Following the tradition of other presidential nominees, Ms. Gall said through an aide that she would not comment on her record or regulatory views while her nomination was pending.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Since 1991, she has been one of three commissioners at the agency, which watches over some 15,000 products.
Over the same period, Ms. Gall has repeatedly voted against safety regulations and has criticized the agency's role in prodding industries to formulate their own standards, which often reduced injuries and deaths.
She has voted against safety standards for baby walkers, crib slats, bunk beds and baby bath seats.
This 'science' more closely resembled 'political' science than traditional scientific inquiry.''
But safety experts say that criticism is unwarranted, and that Ms. Gall's philosophy, if put in force at the agency, will lead to a sharp setback for consumers.
''The mission of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is to reduce or eliminate unreasonable risk of injury,'' said R. David Pittle, a former commissioner at the agency who is now the senior vice president and technical director of Consumers Union.
''If kids year in or year out are killed by some product, the law does not say, 'Well, we have to tell the parents to do a better job.'
That doesn't have much meaning to a parent who has lost a child because of a momentarily inadvertent lapse of attention.''
Global demand for European goods is significantly weaker than most experts had predicted just a few months ago, while energy prices are much higher.
Though inflation in France is slower than in most other European countries, it seems to be gathering speed.
Signs of trouble have been showing up elsewhere in Europe as well.
The Netherlands, among Europe's growth leaders for much of the last decade, reported a few days ago that its economy virtually stopped expanding in the first quarter, and in neighboring Belgium, where business sentiment often presages developments in the euro zone as a whole, confidence fell to its lowest level in two years.

The mix of trends has made it difficult for the European Central Bank to respond.
Unlike the United States Federal Reserve, which has concentrated on combating any slowdown by reducing interest rates five times this year, the European bank has been torn between fears of rising prices and of slumping growth.

France spent most of last year growing and adding jobs at its most robust pace in years.
Most forecasters expected 3 percent growth this year, even allowing for the effects of an American slowdown.
The new figures show French consumers continuing to spend at a healthy rate, reflecting the job growth and the tax cuts adopted last year.
''Realism has taken the upper hand in Europe,'' said Eric Vergnaud, an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris.
''It is time to realize that Europe is not an island,'' he said.
''Things are slowing down, but the slowdown is much more modest than in the United States.''
Not necessarily so in Germany, which accounts for one-third of the euro zone's total economic activity.
Economists sharply reduced their forecasts for Germany just a few months ago, and many are now doing so again.
BNP Paribas expects only 1.5 percent to 1.8 percent growth; Deutsche Bank sees 1.6 percent.
''Even this number requires a substantial rebound'' in the second half of 2001, Deutsche Bank said today in commenting on the latest data.
''The risks remain largely skewed to the downside.''
The lurking threat of inflation complicates the equation.
The biggest reason is the renewed climb in oil prices, which eased slightly late last year but have risen since mid-March.
[Page C6.]
He said that ''growth should gradually recover'' in response to the combination of interest rate reductions, the tax cut that Congress is about to send to President Bush and a likely decline in energy prices.
He said that while the Fed had to be ''quick and aggressive'' in responding to the slowdown, it also had to keep its eye on inflation, which by some measures has been creeping up.
''Given that labor markets remain tight, that inflation remains above the rate that I would find acceptable over the long run and that core inflation has been edging higher,'' Mr. Meyer said, ''attention must also be given to calibrating the easing to avoid overshooting in the other direction in a way that ends up adding to price pressures as growth strengthens.''

''Owing to the variable and long lags of monetary policy,'' Mr. Greenspan said, ''the effect of our recent policy initiatives will take time to strengthen financial portfolios and spill over into demand for goods and services.''

So far, Mr. Greenspan said, consumer spending has not been unduly slow and continued wage gains should help support consumer purchases, which account for about two-thirds of economic activity.
He was generally sanguine about inflation, noting that the Consumer Price Index had been rising, but adding that there had been little change in the broader inflation gauge that he favors.
''In that regard,'' Mr. Greenspan said, ''the lack of pricing power reported overwhelmingly by businesspeople underscores an absence of inflationary zest.''
This comment led some analysts to conclude that the next rate cut, if there is one, will be just a quarter-point.
Despite the potentially conflicting signals from the Fed chairman, the yield on the June futures contract for federal funds, which is the central bank's benchmark interest rate, was unchanged at 3.99 percent yesterday.
This indicates that some investors still think there will be a rate cut when Fed policy makers next meet at the end of June.

''We're not out of the woods,'' said Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown.
''We're waiting for this monetary medicine to take effect, and we're also hoping for some fiscal medicine to help out,'' he said, referring to President Bush's proposed tax cut.
Economists had predicted a slip of 2 percent but this data is known for its very volatile swings.

While the rebound of the stock market since early April indicates that many investors are expecting the economy to recover in the second half of the year, the rising number of layoffs and further increases in the nation's unemployment rate could dampen consumer spending and slow economic growth further.
ABC News, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, announced it was trimming 125 jobs from its work force.

''The reason Lowe's has survived and thrived as No.
2 is because of their efficient structure and distribution,'' David Strasser, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said.
''They can probably do a better job on the cost side of the equation, but Home Depot is huge.
They are the 800-pound gorilla.''
Many factors that dampened enthusiasm last year have improved markedly in recent months.
The Fed, which spent the first half of 2000 raising short-term interest rates, has lopped 2.5 percentage points off the overnight federal funds rate since January.
Lower market interest rates have sparked a surge in home-mortgage refinancings.
Lumber prices are sharply higher.
Sales of both new and existing homes remain healthy.
And consumer confidence appears to be improving.
Lowe's had a 20 percent increase in earnings for the quarter despite tepid sales in stores open at least a year.
Earnings rose 8 percent after adjusting for the extra time.
The surge in Lowe's stock has led some admirers to pull back.
Indeed, even though Home Depot is trading at a far loftier price to earnings multiple, 42 to 29, some analysts and portfolio managers are reluctant to express a preference for one company over the other.

''We think the stock is getting the recognition it deserves,'' he said, ''but with the price where it is, the risk-reward is less compelling.''
''There are two key reasons for doing that,'' he said.
''First, we wanted to find a company that would benefit from the aggressive Fed actions to lower interest rates.''
Mr. March said that, at current interest-rate levels, more than 30 percent of existing mortgages could be refinanced and that lower rates spur sales of existing homes, which also leads to more home-improvement business.

''The second reason is that the operating metrics at Lowe's are improving relative to Home Depot,'' he said.
''They are getting better at managing their stores and they are building larger stores, which run better.''
Currently, Lowe's operates 680 stores throughout the country and it plans to add another 120 this year.
By comparison, Home Depot has 1,150 stores in the United States and has plans to add another 200 here and abroad.
''Lowe's is doing very, very well this year, but Home Depot's numbers, and the absolute levels, are superior,'' said Alan Rifkin, a specialty-retail analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Among other things, Mr. Rifkin cited higher sales per square foot and better returns on assets, equity and invested capital as measures where Home Depot has a clear lead.
''Many view Home Depot as so efficient that the opportunities to improve are lower than Lowe's potential,'' he said.
Mr. Nardelli has said he intends to implement G.E.
's vaunted six sigma procedure, a complex plan for quality control and cost cutting, to promote efficiencies at Home Depot.
While the method clearly worked in manufacturing, analysts are watching to see how it does in retailing.
''Home Depot has always been about entrepreneurs,'' said Mr. Strasser of Salomon Smith Barney.
''Mr.
Nardelli's challenge is to keep that spirit current while centralizing certain aspects of the business, like distribution.
It's a very sensitive thing.''
New York is no exception.
Without the arrival of a million foreigners in the 1990's, the city's population would have declined in the last decade, instead of surpassing the eight million mark.
Forty percent of New Yorkers are foreign-born, the most since 1910, and they are responsible for revitalizing many of the city's neighborhoods.
These recent arrivals, hailing from a growing number of countries, contributed not only to the city's diversity, but also to the diversity of their own ethnic communities.
Puerto Ricans and Chinese are no longer overwhelming majorities within the Hispanic and Asian populations, as immigrants from places like Mexico, Colombia, India and Korea have increasingly made their way to the city.
The demographic shift is especially pronounced among Hispanics, the largest minority group in the city, numbering 2.1 million people and accounting for 27 percent of the population.
This is the largest Hispanic community of any American city, and an increasingly diverse one.
Puerto Ricans, who in 1990 were a majority, are now 36 percent of the total.
Their raw numbers actually declined by 12 percent in the 1990's, as retirees returned to Puerto Rico.
Though statistics are useful in defining existing population patterns, the reasons behind the various demographic shifts in the last decade are hard to quantify.
Immigration has long been a mysteriously informal and deeply personal saga, and so it remains today.
To this day, more than half the city's Mexican population is believed to come from Puebla, and there are small towns in the depressed, indigenous Mixteca region of that state whose economies are fed almost entirely by dollars being sent home from New York.
More recent immigrants come from the central states of Michoacan and Jalisco, and Mexico City, too, and many of them have settled in Westchester County.
As in the Asian community, the increasing diversity of the city's Hispanic population should help challenge dated notions.
One is that minorities are monoliths.
There is a strong cultural and linguistic bond between Mexicans, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, to be sure, but New Yorkers must now stop thinking of ''Hispanic'' and ''Puerto Rican'' as interchangeable terms.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
This, in turn, requires city and state agencies to make it a higher priority to address the pressing social problems affecting immigrants, such as strained school systems and the abusive treatment of undocumented workers by employers.
The Puerto Rican political establishment, for its part, is beginning to adjust to the changing reality.
Citizenship is one obvious gulf that has traditionally separated Puerto Ricans from many other Hispanic groups in New York.
But in taking a greater interest in immigration and other issues affecting the broader Hispanic population, Puerto Rican politicians have an opportunity to help forge a pan-Latino political identity, and to capitalize on it.
And yet, after several weeks of soul-searching about the possibility of switching parties, Mr. Miller has made clear that he plans to remain under the Democratic roof.
It is home, just like the ''rock house'' here in Young Harris (population 604), only a few miles from the North Carolina line.

''I've watched four generations come and go in this house, and I've watched four generations of Democrats come and go in my life,'' he said.
''I might not like the changes.
I might see my grandson out there, fourth generation, with his baseball cap on backwards, and that frustrates me.
But I know he's a good, decent kid, and I hope he's going to amount to something, so I go along.
It's family.''
A crucial question for the new Democratic plurality in the Senate, however, is how often Mr. Miller will call himself a Democrat but vote like a Republican.
He has already sided with the Senate Republicans and the White House on many of the year's most contentious issues: for President Bush's tax cut, for the confirmation of John Ashcroft as attorney general and Theodore B. Olson as solicitor general, and for the repeal of workplace ergonomics regulations.
But now that Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont has shifted the balance in the Senate by leaving the Republican Party to become an independent, Mr. Miller has one of the most valuable votes in his party's caucus.
In a chamber that the Democrats control by 50-49-1, he has the potential to swing virtually any vote to either side.
That gives him outsized influence for a freshman.
And at the age of 69, with 80 percent approval ratings in Georgia and considerable ambivalence about running for re-election in 2004, he is largely immune to heavy-handed persuasion.
''He's in the majority party now and is also highly sought after by the White House, so he has the best of both worlds,'' said Keith Mason, an Atlanta lawyer and longtime Miller aide and adviser.
''And he doesn't need the job.''
If the party could regain that trust, voters would gladly support the more progressive elements of the Democratic agenda, Mr. Miller said.
He argued, for example, that he had been able as governor to create expensive new education programs in Georgia, including lottery-financed college scholarships and universal prekindergarten, by first generating good will through tax cuts.

But it is not simply Mr. Miller's refusal to be led ''blindly off a cliff'' by his more liberal counterparts that has vexed fellow Democrats.
It is also his penchant for trumpeting his disenchantment with the party as brassily as possible.
Though he supported Al Gore, he loves to laud Mr. Bush.

''I have respect and affection for all my Senate colleagues,'' Mr. Miller wrote in a statement explaining his stance, ''but I can't help but wish that among us there was more getting along than getting even.''
The Rev.
Others have found the onetime history professor's tone patronizing, particularly coming from a backbencher.
''He comes in and lectures people, and I don't know how well that is going over with his colleagues in the Senate,'' said Representative John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat who coveted the Senate appointment that went to Mr. Miller.
''I guess that is the teacher coming out in him.''
Of Mr. Carville, he said: ''I couldn't imagine him doing anything that would have driven a wedge in our friendship.
But when you ask for your money back after you've paid the man hundreds of thousands of dollars over several years, that kind of gets to you.''
After two weeks of reflection in late April and early May, Mr. Miller decided to stay with the Democrats; he cites his inherited belief that government can be a force for good.

''I am much more conservative than most of my fellow Democrats,'' he said, ''but at the same time I have this thing about trying -- this sounds corny -- trying to save this party from itself.''
''I hope we can continue to find ways in which to provide him with opportunities to become even more engaged on issues that are important to him and to the caucus,'' Mr. Daschle said.
He said that depending on his health and his sense of accomplishment, he might run again in 2004, though he is currently leaning slightly against doing so.
For the moment, the new calculus in the Senate, which has made this Georgia freshman one of a handful of swing votes, is giving him some satisfaction.
''I think the real minority in the Senate right now is not so much the Republicans as it is the liberal Democrats,'' he said, ''because they have to have these 8 or 12 centrists to do anything.''
''If I were one of 60 or one of 40,'' he said with a grin, ''I don't think I'd be enjoying it as much.''
EURO SLIDES.
The euro fell as rising prices in Italy fueled concern that inflation will prevent the European Central Bank from lowering interest rates.
The Senate Agriculture Committee is putting off hearings for a top Agriculture Department nominee who has been criticized by several civil rights groups for saying that the success of three Iowa farming counties was based on their homogenous background.
The population of the counties -- Carroll, Lyon and Sioux -- is predominantly white and Christian.
''I would need to carefully consider the entire record before I could make any decision,'' Mr. Harkin said.
Until he makes that decision, the senator will not schedule confirmation hearings, a spokesman said.
''They're very diverse in their economic growth, but they're very focused, have been very nondiverse in their ethnic background and their religious background and there's something there that has enabled them to succeed and to succeed very well.''

The Congressional Black Caucus wrote Senator Harkin and Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana and the current chairman of the Agriculture Committee, saying they doubted Mr. Dorr's ''ability to serve all American farmers in a way that is sensitive to their needs and struggles.''

The Bush administration continues to give Mr. Dorr its full support, a White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said today.
''We urge the senators to listen to Mr. Dorr during his confirmation hearing because any rush to judgment would shortchange the process and a fine nominee.''
A farmer since 1972, Mr. Dorr became an advocate of the importance of transforming family farms into far larger commercial, technologically advanced operations after graduating in business from Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa.
Mr. Dorr's promotion of huge 225,000-acre farms has fed opposition from nonprofit organizations like the Environmental Working Group.
''He may be the only farm policy expert in the country who is actively supporting more megafarms when thousands of family farms are going out of business,'' said Ken Cook, president of the research group.

Yesterday's tentative trading may signal an underlying apprehension surrounding the sustainable strength of the American economy.
Investors are expecting more forecasts of weak corporate earnings in the coming weeks.
And today's unemployment report is expected to show more job losses, indicating continued weakness in the sluggish economy.
Some analysts expect further bad news will give the Federal Reserve more reason to cut interest rates for the sixth time this year when it meets later this month.
''It's really a case of bad news is good news,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen.
''The unemployment numbers continue to make it seem like the Fed is going to ease again.''
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.37 percent from 5.50 percent on Wednesday.

The price of the 30-year bond rose 17/32, to 94 23/32.
As was the case in the 1990-91 recession -- but in contrast to almost any other downturn -- many college-educated white-collar workers have been among the first to lose their jobs, according to the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by either one-quarter or one-half of a percentage point when it meets at the end of this month.
The Fed has already cut its benchmark rate -- which affects the rates on many credit card, small-business and auto loans -- five times since January.
''The change in the unemployment rate was statistically insignificant and a misleading sign of what is really going on,'' said Maury Harris, the chief United States economist at UBS Warburg.
''It is not clear that the worst is over.''
This suggests that the sector, hampered by high energy prices and sluggish business spending on new equipment, will be weak for the near future, economists said.
In recent months, consumer spending on services, like transportation and day care, and on housing has remained mostly brisk, allowing these industries to add jobs and, so far at least, apparently keeping the economy out of recession.
Construction employment increased 31,000, well ahead of its pace of the last year and a half, partly because the interest rate cuts have encouraged people to buy a new home or remodel the one they live in.
Most analysts predict that economic activity will reach a nadir in the early summer, and then pick up in the second half of the year, as businesses finish unloading excess inventory and as consumers receive tax-rebate checks from the government.
''I see no evidence in this report that we've reached a bottom,'' said Chris Varvares, the president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis.
''We probably still have a few months of manufacturing-employment declines to go.
But we think we're getting close to the bottom.''
It still expects the economy to grow 3 percent in the second half of the year.

Typically, manufacturing companies struggle before service businesses during a slowdown, because people can more easily delay the purchase of cars and appliances than health care or education, for example.
In the past, a rapid decline in manufacturing employment has usually been followed by a recession.
Today, however, many analysts believe a serious downturn can be avoided because businesses and policy makers are using technology to react to the economy's shifts more quickly than in the past.
Manufacturing companies cut 124,000 jobs last month.
Another unusual aspect of the current downturn has been the swiftness with which large numbers of college graduates have lost their jobs.
By contrast, the jobless rate of people without a high school diploma -- 6.5 percent last month -- has grown only one-tenth of a percentage point since October.
''The recent slowdown is more egalitarian.''
Manufacturing jobs require more technical knowledge than they once did, and American industry has become more devoted to turning out high-technology goods.
As a result more factory employees hold college degrees than in the past.
Companies have also become more aggressive in cutting a broad range of costs -- like the salaries of managers and clerical workers -- in an effort to increase profits.
''The weakness in May, over all, is a little less than in April,'' said Thomas J. Nardone, the head of the government division that compiles the report.
Still, Mr. Nardone cautioned against reading very much into the jobless rate's fall.
He noted that the government calculates the unemployment rate from its survey of households, which is more volatile than its larger survey of businesses.
The overall change in employment -- minus 19,000 in May -- comes from the business survey.

''You always have to be careful looking at one month's change in the household survey,'' Mr. Nardone said.
Because employment traditionally grows throughout the spring and summer -- and the government's seasonal adjustments account for this growth -- the May survey might have overstated the labor market strength somewhat, economists said.
Correction: June 6, 2001, Wednesday A front-page article on Saturday about the unemployment rate in May misstated a change in the second-quarter projections by Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis.
Based on the jobless numbers, the firm now expects the number of hours worked by Americans to decline about 2 percent and the economy to grow about 1 percent.
It does not expect the economy over all to contract 2 percent.
He calls risk management a crucial goal for the fund.
''We tend to approach the market from a pretty conservative point of view,'' he said.
''A lot of our success over the years is avoiding losers rather than always hitting home runs.''

To uncover value, Mr. Lyon works with 14 analysts who contribute ideas on potential buys to a pool of about 450 companies.
He starts by screening the pool for what he calls relative value, which takes into account the company's price-to-earnings multiple, his target P/E and consensus earnings estimates.
He uses that information to eliminate all but about 100 companies whose stock prices he thinks can increase at least 15 percent over 12 months.
Next, Mr. Lyon screens for earnings stability.
He compares the most recent monthly change in consensus earnings estimates with the average monthly change over five years.
''When you put the two screens together,'' he said, ''you get the intersection of companies with a minimum 15 percent upside, but maybe as high as 30 or 40 percent, and earnings that aren't falling apart.
That's the sweet spot of the market for value stocks.''
Additional research eliminates all but about 15 to 25 of the 75 stocks that pass both screens.
A crucial factor is the presence of a catalyst -- like a new product or service, new management or corporate restructuring -- that can lift a stock price.
The largest chunk of the fund is in financial stocks, at 22 percent of assets.
''We expect interest rates to decline somewhat further and stay at a relatively low level for at least another 12 months,'' he said.
''That's a real positive for financial stocks.''

Technology, by contrast, is now just 4 percent of the portfolio because of concern about valuations.
That is down from 22 percent 12 months ago.
He considers selling when earnings estimates deteriorate, a catalyst becomes questionable or the stock reaches what he calls full value.
Selling big positions in a concentrated portfolio creates a high turnover -- 400 percent last year -- but the fund tries to offset gains with losses in other areas to minimize taxes.
Financial stocks should benefit from restructuring efforts by individual companies as well as from additional rate cuts, Mr. Lyon said.
A favorite is Citigroup, which he began buying in September 1999 at $32.50 a share.
''The new Citi is better diversified and even more of a growth stock,'' he said.
''We believe that the combination of growth and diversification will let its P/E expand up toward its competitors.''
Citigroup sells for 17.4 times 2001 earnings; he thinks that multiple can reach 20 in 12 months.
He expects the stock price to reach $70 in that time; it is now at $51.80.

Mr. Lyon also likes MetLife, which he bought at $17.10 in May 2000, just after the initial offering.
''They're cutting costs now, and they'll continue to do so,'' he said.
Management also has the opportunity to cross-sell insurance products to its group life and disability policy owners, he added.
On Friday, the shares closed at $31.82; his 12-month target is $40.
Mr. Lyon began buying shares of the Loews Corporation, which owns or controls Bulova, Diamond Offshore Drilling and Loews Hotels, among other businesses, at $44 in October 2000.
The catalyst is the company's new openness toward investors.
Its Lorillard Tobacco unit, he added, is gaining market share while tobacco litigation is turning less hostile.
And the CNA unit, which sells commercial property, casualty and other insurance, is improving.
''You have a collection of operating businesses that are all poised to do very well,'' Mr. Lyon said, ''and they're selling at a very low multiple'' of 10 times 2001 earnings.
He expects the stock to reach $100 in a year; it is now at $68.16.

For anyone aspiring to hold the reins of the nation's economy, there is a new way to hone the skills for central banking, courtesy of the Swiss National Bank.
Swiss National, Switzerland's central bank, has posted a new computer game on its Web site (www.snb.ch; click on the small ''e'' for the English version) that lets the player take charge of a virtual economy.
Players of the Monetary Policy Simulation Game can try their mouse hands at raising and lowering interest rates, and adjusting other variables in hopes of keeping the economy growing without inflation.
''Economic prosperity wins a yellow smiley face, but a recession merits a frown,'' explained Yvan Lengwiler, 36, the economist in the bank's research department who devised the game.

All of Switzerland's major commercial banks have ordered copies, available on floppy disk, and some academics have downloaded it for their economics classes.

The game can be adjusted for a variety of economic scenarios.
All the while, the player must cope with ''unexpected events that befall any economy,'' Mr. Lengwiler said.
''Playing the game is simple, but not to make mistakes is difficult,'' he said.
''Sometimes moving around an interest rate, for example, can have surprising effects.''
While Monetary Policy has helped lighten the Swiss National Bank's stodgy image, Mr. Lengwiler warns that the game's model economy is not Switzerland's.
''It should also be clear that the Swiss National Bank does not use this model in its monetary policy decision making or in its inflation forecasting,'' he says in the game's instructions.

Mr. Bush seemed intent on projecting an image of relaxed confidence.
People want to get things done.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Bush exhibited none of the truculence that some Senate Republicans, loath to relinquish the reins of power, have expressed in recent days.
''There are some things over which I have no control and some things I can influence,'' Mr. Bush said this morning as he sat in his office near the front of Air Force One, which was taking him back to Washington from Tampa, Fla., where he had been hammering nails into a house being built by Habitat for Humanity.
''And I'm able to distinguish between the two.''
Mr. Bush said he tried to persuade Mr. Jeffords not to leave the Republican Party, which had been his political home for more than two decades, but that ''if a person makes up their mind that they want to make the decision he made, it's awful hard to change a fellow's mind.''
In addition to breaking bread tonight with Mr. McCain, whose tendency to go his own way and get his own spotlight could weaken the president, Mr. Bush was scheduled to have dinner on Thursday night with Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the new majority leader.
Also on Thursday, an administration official said, Mr. Bush is scheduled to meet privately at the White House with Senator Lincoln Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican who has expressed qualms similar to Mr. Jeffords's about the conservative tilt of the Bush administration.
''Some of the meetings will be aimed at legislation, some of them will be pure social occasions,'' he said, adding that the goal would be ''putting together coalitions that will pass meaningful, important legislation.''

Mr. Bush was clearly trying to demonstrate such an effort when he met in the White House this afternoon with an array of senators who spanned the ideological spectrum, including Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in last year's presidential election.
They were talking about education legislation.
''We have an opportunity to show the American people that although the structure of the Senate may have been altered somewhat, we still can get things done,'' Mr. Bush told reporters who were ushered into the meeting for just a few minutes.

''I see him as a friend,'' Mr. Bush said.
''We don't agree 100 percent, but there are other members of the Senate that I don't agree with 100 percent.
That doesn't mean we can't discuss things.
And I will, I'll discuss things with him.''
This is an arguably bumpy juncture of Mr. Bush's presidency.
Although Congress recently handed him an enormous legislative victory by passing a tax cut very close in dimensions to the one he wanted, control in the Senate has now shifted.
And when Mr. Bush leaves the country next week for his first trip to Europe as president, he will arrive in a continent usually friendly to American presidents but deeply worried about several of Mr. Bush's decisions and policies so far.
And throughout the interview, he adopted a casual tone, which he struck at the very beginning by showing his visitor the shower and private bedroom, tucked in the 747's nose, that are at his disposal.
''You're making them up as you're asking the questions,'' he said at one point.
'Thank you, Mr. President, for the tax cut.'
He has never done that.
Apart from that, he pronounced himself content in his job, saying, ''I haven't had any blue days.
Every day has been chipper.''
Then, in an ambiguous tone that might or might not have been facetious, he added, ''Every day is a great day when you're the president.''

CHEERIOS prices are up.
So are AT&T's basic rates.
President Bush wants to protect the steel industry.
Those events may not seem to be closely related, but there is a common thread.
Corporate America is being hurt by rising costs in a slowing economy, and is looking for ways to pass on the costs to consumers.
Inflation is still widely viewed as something that went away two decades ago, and therefore of little concern to investors.
It is recession that has worried Wall Street, and the markets now seem to be reasonably confident that the Federal Reserve has warded off that threat.
But within the economic slowdown are the forces that threaten to raise prices.
Soaring energy costs in particular have squeezed many companies, and they need to charge more.
There is a story in the box of Wheaties on your breakfast table.
Cereal prices soared from 1980 to 1993, rising more than the general inflation rate every year.

Then the industry hit a wall of consumer resistance.
Since 1993, cereal prices have lagged overall inflation, and General Mills says that before it raised prices by 2.1 percent last week, it was getting about the same price it was collecting in 1993.
The share price of Kellogg, the closest thing to a pure play in cereals, reflects the changed environment.
It rose 1,000 percent over the 13 years ending in 1993, four times the pace of the Standard & Poor's 500.
Since then, Kellogg is down 6 percent while the S.& P. is up 174 percent.

Cereals are an extreme example, but many companies have found it difficult to raise prices in recent years.
Now, the need is there.
To the extent companies can get away with it, inflation will rise.
To the extent they can't, profits will suffer.
Kellogg has not said if it will match General Mills' price increase.
But with many companies in the industry reeling, that may be changing.
AT&T's announced increases apply to its basic plan, which covers the millions of customers who are not smart enough to sign up for a discount plan.
So far the discount plans are not being changed.
The steel case serves as a reminder that politics can play a role in pricing.
President Bush has started an investigation under a section of the law that provides relief for domestic companies if they can prove they are being hurt by a surge in imports -- even if they can't prove dumping.
But if the steel makers win, the companies, like the auto makers, that buy steel are the losers.
Those price increases would filter through everywhere.
The Fed's aggressive easing will not soon revive the new economy, where far too much money was invested and overcapacity haunts many companies.
But lower interest rates are stimulating the old economy, where companies need to pass on higher costs, particularly for energy.
We are not approaching the stagflation of the 1970's, when a stagnating economy combined with inflation in the double digits.
But there are more inflationary pressures now than one would expect in a weak economy.
If the current round of price increases endure, more could follow.

Mr. Faison and Mr. Shepherd are the fourth and fifth men, wrongly convicted or accused of murder, to walk to freedom on a bridge built by Mr. Race, private investigator.
The wrongs that he is righting are not just the years stolen from the men he has been able to help, say those who know him.
His work, they say, must be seen against a larger canvas of sloppy investigations during the chaotic years of crack bloodshed; failures by prosecutors and the courts to scrutinize those cases; and perhaps Mr. Race's own role in the conviction of at least two innocent people.
''As an act of penance or atonement, this work is particularly meaningful,'' said Ron Kuby, the lawyer persuaded by Mr. Race to take on the cause of Mr. Shepherd and Mr. Faison.
''People's motivations are complicated.
Mike, having been a homicide cop in East New York during a time when there was so much bad police work going on, has a very deep understanding of just how easy it is to convict innocent people.''
It's just a paradox.
He is so caring about injustice.
That's based on his actions -- not just what comes out of his mouth.''
Others say that Mr. Race is able to unravel wrongful convictions because he knows the investigative slipknots, having bound up innocent people himself.
''Race is recovering from what he used to do,'' said Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney.
''Maybe he has honest guilt.''
Confident that both critics and friends are wrong about what drives him, Mr. Race professes bewilderment at suggestions that his work as a private investigator is an attempt to make amends for his life as an officer, or that people can speculate intelligently about his motives.
''I don't know how people can make a determination like that when I can't,'' Mr. Race said.
''I'm not on a guilt trip.
I don't like shifting blame, but everyone involved has a responsibility to realize what was done.''

Indeed, in several of Mr. Race's police cases that went wrong, a share of the responsibility would appear to fall on the office of one of his critics, Mr. Hynes.
Two of those people have been exonerated and sent home from prison.
All parties now accept that the informant fabricated his testimony; only the source of Mr. Garner's knowledge of the cases is in dispute.
One fact is clear from police and court records: virtually no effort was made by detectives working under Mr. Race's supervision or prosecutors from Mr. Hynes's office to corroborate Mr. Garner's claims, despite two florid warning signs.

The prosecutor asked the judge for a recess, saying he wanted to arrange a polygraph test before presenting Mr. Garner as his sole eyewitness.
A third man, Ruben Ortega, has a habeas corpus petition pending in federal court, said Steve Wasserman, a Legal Aid lawyer who represents him.
''He knows what people do because he did it himself.''
''I have never done a thing in my life to be ashamed of,'' Mr. Race said.
''Did I make mistakes?
Yeah.
Do I sleep at night?
Yeah.''

A day after the release of statistics showing the Japanese economy to be far weaker than expected, pressure began mounting on the central bank to expand its role in stemming the slide.
Heizo Takenaka, the state minister for economic and fiscal policy, said today that he planned to attend the Bank of Japan's policy meeting this week, in hopes of finding a way to coordinate monetary policy, which is set by the bank, with the government's restructuring plans.
But economists and investors took his plans to mean that the government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi intends to prod the bank into further easing of its already extremely loose monetary policy.
''I think even though they are not officially consulting, the Bank of Japan and the Koizumi cabinet have a sort of tacit agreement to coordinate their policies,'' said Takuro Morinaga, senior analyst at the Sanwa Research Institute.
''Both institutions believe there can be no structural reform unless the economy is in or close to a recession, but the bank can ensure things don't get worse.''

The government is moving forward with plans for an overhaul of fiscal policy and the banking system at a time when the economy is sliding into recession, a recipe for disaster in the minds of many economists.

Since then, the bank has maintained reserves of at least 5 trillion yen in the banking system, and many economists say the amount will rise.
Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo and a former official at the Bank of Japan, foresees a move to 7 trillion yen in reserves, though not at the policy meeting on Thursday and Friday.
''Probably after the Upper House election in July,'' Mr. Kanno said, ''the bank will be forced to take another step.''
Whether such a move will provide a lift is unclear.
Foreign analysts like Paul Krugman, the economist and a columnist for The New York Times; Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Center for International Development at Harvard University; and Andrew Smithers, a fund management consultant, say the problem in Japan is excess savings, which must be driven out of bank and savings accounts and into investments.
The opposing view, held by many economists and investors and, most important, by Mr. Hayami, says that additional monetary easing will do little.
''With a dysfunctional banking system, which has, for more than a decade, failed to push savings into the private-sector economy, monetary growth has failed to generate new credit creation by the banking system,'' said Jeff Uscher, an equity strategist at WestLB Panemure in New York.
''Instead, liquidity remains trapped in the money market, in deposits or in the dresser drawer.''
Another reason is -- in a word -- genomics.
As scientists unravel the human genetic code, they are discovering a host of genes and proteins produced by those genes involved in disease.
That is leading to a burst of new tests that can predict whether a person might get a disease or determine if he or she already has one.
Gene-based tests are also beginning to be used to pick the most appropriate drugs for different patients.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Indeed, analysts say, the first medical payoffs from genomics will not be drugs but diagnostic tests, which can be brought to market far more quickly.
Start-up companies like diaDexus and Exact Sciences, as well as established companies like Applied BioSystems, are developing molecular diagnostics, the term for gene and protein testing.
They hope that patent protection for the genes will allow them to charge higher prices for their tests than in the past, when diagnostics was the poor relation to therapeutics.
That is good for the developers of such tests, and it also leaves the medical laboratories in a stronger position -- as the organizations that will perform these new tests for doctors.
''All these companies are discovering new genes,'' said Jorge A. Leon, vice president for applied genomics at Quest, the largest laboratory company.
''Guess who is in a position to translate those discoveries faster into clinical success?''
Investors have guessed.
Shares of Quest, which languished below $10 for several years, adjusted for a recent stock split, shot above $71 by the end of last year, making it the year's best performer among the Fortune 500, though the stock has since come down somewhat.
LabCorp, the No.
2 company, has had an equally meteoric rise.
Today, the gene tests account for only about $1 billion of the $33 billion spent on lab tests in the United States each year, according to The Laboratory Industry Report, a newsletter.
And over all, spending on lab tests is increasing only 3 percent a year.
''You really can't say it's a growth industry,'' said Jondavid Klipp, managing editor of the newsletter.
Still, gene-based tests can cost several hundred dollars while a routine blood test or Pap smear might fetch only $10 to $40.
And gene testing is growing at more than 20 percent a year, while routine testing is flat.

Among the genetic tests are ones that can measure the amount of virus in people infected by H.I.V.
or hepatitis C and genetically analyze the viruses to predict which drugs will work best.
There are also tests for genetic defects that contribute to abnormal blood clotting and for cystic fibrosis.
In 1999, 170,000 clinical labs in the United States performed 5.7 billion tests, according to a report last year by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences.
Commercial laboratories account for only about 30 percent of testing.
About 60 percent is done in hospital laboratories and 10 percent in doctors' offices.
The lab business has a marred history.
Testing errors were so common in the 1980's that Congress passed the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendments of 1988, imposing new regulations.
In the 1990's, most of the major companies were accused of defrauding Medicare by billing for tests that were not needed or not even performed and for paying kickbacks to doctors.
But now, things are looking up.
Patients fed up with the restrictions of managed care are forcing some insurers to allow physicians more discretion, including ordering more tests.
At the same time, the consolidation in the industry has enabled the biggest companies to command higher prices for their services.
In 1990, the top eight companies controlled less than 50 percent of the business going to commercial laboratories, according to the Institute of Medicine.
Now, Quest and LabCorp alone control 60 percent of the market, and they have renegotiated contracts with big health care providers like Aetna and Cigna.

Consolidation may continue.
Quest and LabCorp say they represent only 16 percent of the business when hospital labs are counted.
''There are thousand of little labs out there and thousand of hospitals we compete against,'' said Thomas P. Mac Mahon, LabCorp's chief executive.
Both Quest and LabCorp aim to raise revenue by roughly 10 percent a year and earnings per share about 30 percent a year the next couple of years.

Quest, once known as MetPath, was started in 1967 by Paul Brown, a pathologist at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, who started out staining Pap smears in his New York apartment.
He began importing techniques from manufacturing companies to improve Quest's quality, trying to cut the number of orders with missing information and the waiting time for patients having blood tests.
''It's an industry that can learn so much from other industries,'' he said.
Quest performs about 250 million tests a year at 30 major labs and 150 smaller ones.
The laboratory in Teterboro, which serves much of New York and North Jersey, becomes active at night as tens of thousands of samples arrive.
Robot carts deliver the samples -- glucose and cholesterol tests to the chemistry department; stool samples and throat cultures to microbiology; lead poisoning tests to toxicology; amniotic fluid to test fetuses for genetic disorders to cytogenetics; pregnancy and prostate cancer tests to endocrinology; Pap smears and biopsies to pathology.
By 7 the next morning, most of the tests have been performed and the results transmitted to doctors.
LabCorp, formed by the 1995 merger of National Health Laboratories and Roche Biomedical Laboratories, describes itself in news releases as the first lab fully to embrace gene testing.
About 16 percent of its revenue in 2000 came from so-called esoteric testing, an industry term that includes genetic and other nonroutine tests.
That compares with 12 percent for Quest.
The smaller lab companies have more specialized approaches.
Specialty Laboratories, with revenue last year of $153.2 million, has been growing more than 15 percent a year because it does only esoteric tests.
Its stock has risen from $16 at its initial public offering in December to $33.88 yesterday.
Impath, which specializes in diagnosing cancer, takes another approach.
Anu D. Saad, chief executive, said the company, based in New York, is more a consulting firm that advises physicians than a lab that merely does a test and spits back a number.
Impath gets about $700 a patient for testing, she said, far higher than the $35 to $40 average at Quest or LabCorp.
The company has been profitable since 1994, with revenue increasing 50 percent a year.

There are some uncertainties ahead for the industry.
With molecular diagnostic tests costing much more than routine tests, insurance companies and government agencies -- which pay for most lab tests -- are expected to scrutinize them heavily before agreeing to pay for them.
Laboratory executives argue that testing represents only 4 percent of health care spending, and they say testing saves money over all by allowing the best treatment to be chosen quickly.
Figuring out the type of hepatitis C virus a patient has, for instance, can avert months of treatment with a drug costing thousands of dollars.
Moreover, as technology improves, what is now esoteric might become routine, allowing tests to be performed by physicians or even by patients at home.
Quest is already moving to appeal directly to consumers.
This month it is opening several storefront clinics in Colorado and three other states at which people will be able to order tests without seeing a physician.
That is illegal in many other states.
Whether tests are ordered by patients or doctors, more tests seem likely.
Indeed, some experts foresee a time not so long from now when genetic testing will change medicine mostly from a system of detecting and treating disease to one of predicting and preventing it.
''With genomics,'' Mr. Freeman of Quest said, ''we're going to capture individuals for testing earlier in life.''
Statements from Charles Schwab, STMicroelectronics and Silicon Storage Technology reinforced investors' fears that the economy might be continuing to weaken and dampened hopes for a rebound in profits soon.
Contributing to the malaise was the near collapse of a big acquisition.
''In a real sense, we seem to be having a relatively across-the-board, broad sell-off,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company.
The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index dropped for the fifth consecutive day, losing 77.59 points, or 3.7 percent, to close at 2,044.07.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 181.49 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 10,690.13.

G.E.
Schwab said its second-quarter earnings would probably fall short of Wall Street's estimates because of a decline in stock trading by its customers.
Shares of Schwab, the leading discount and online brokerage firm, fell $1.32, to $16.03.
The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.22 percent from 5.26 percent on Wednesday.
IF you are keeping score at home, note that the relief pitcher is taking a beating.
Then Donald T. DiFrancesco, the acting governor, left the race in April when faced with ethical questions, momentarily leaving Mr. Schundler unchallenged.

As Mr. Franks scrambled to set up his campaign on the familiar promise to reform Trenton, Mr. Schundler kept telling his well-practiced story of having reformed Jersey City and his ideas for easing sprawl and expanding school choice.
(He is not always as quick to trumpet his opposition to abortion rights and new gun control laws.)
Now, with the election 10 days away and the race suddenly about even, the usually polite, mild-mannered Mr. Franks seems to fear getting locked in the basement himself and has been screaming and shouting and throwing everything he can get his hands on at the door.
And the usually voluble, often high-handed Mr. Schundler is ranting and raving as well.
Mr. Franks opened their televised debate last week by accusing Mr. Schundler of ''taking money from needy children,'' by using scholarship money for self-promotion.
Asked later about the debate's tone, Mr. Franks explained, ''It's Bret.''
Moi?
All he said was that ''Bob doesn't like to present accurate facts,'' and that Mr. Franks had ''disqualified himself'' from being governor by not telling the truth.
(One of his mailings depicts Mr. Franks as Pinocchio.)
As for the debate's rancor, Mr. Schundler said, ''I think he's feeling more desperate.''
''Bob Franks was lying about property taxes,'' Mr. Schundler's 9-year-old daughter told her father on stage just after the debate, hitting his back for emphasis.
''He was lying on the TV.''

They figured that unplugging Mr. DiFrancesco and plugging in Mr. Franks would take care of Mr. Schundler.
The machinations in Trenton fed Mr. Schundler's self-image as a lone warrior, battling Democrats in Hudson County, Republicans in Trenton, and any evils (or Garden State Parkway tolls) in between.

The Trenton leadership dislikes Mr. Schundler, said one former Republican State House aide, ''because he dislikes them.''
No kidding.
Mr. Schundler said he told Mr. DiFrancesco point blank several months ago that he should change certain state policies or he would run against him, and he predicted, ''I'll beat you.''
Mr. Franks, who grew up in the state party, says he is ''the only Republican'' who can beat the Democrats in the fall.
But first, he has to get there.
Or maybe it's just another day.
CREDIT card companies are aggressive in luring new card holders, offering incentives to persuade people already carrying a wallet full of cards to use one creditor's card over another's.
They dangle lower interest rates and frequent-flier miles.
Now some inventors have recently won patents that may make some of the cards themselves easier to handle than others.
Kurt Campisano, who is from Philadelphia and works for First USA Bank, won a patent for a credit card that a user does not even have to keep in his wallet.
Mr. Campisano's invention links the card to a holder's phone number.
The phone number is assigned as an ''alias,'' Mr. Campisano writes in his patent.
Then the card holder chooses a PIN, or personal identification number.
That number remains known only to the card holder, like PIN's for a bank machine card.
So when the credit card holder leaves home without it, it won't matter.
To make a purchase, the owner of the credit card would simply enter his 10-digit telephone number and PIN into the kind of credit card reading device already in use among merchants.
Once the numbers are entered, the credit card company would retrieve the holder's account number, charge him for the purchase and authorize the sale.
The card holder would still have to sign a receipt.
Mr. Campisano says his invention is intended to be used at any retail outlet, over the phone for catalog sales, and on the Internet.
With phone sales, the telephone and PIN numbers would be punched in with touch-tone buttons.

He said it would also diminish the risk of losing a credit card or having it stolen by carrying it around all the time.
For those who do not mind carrying cards but would prefer fewer of them, a Hawaii inventor offers the credit card-drivers license.
James Yang won a patent for a drivers license with conventional picture, address and identifying information, like height and weight.
But the card also bears a credit card logo and the name of the bank or financial institution that issued it.
It gives the holder's Social Security number, too, and an embossed credit card number and expiration date.

On the back of the card, next to the place for a signature, is a magnetic strip embedded with data about the credit card so merchants can process the card and verify it.
Though his invention is designed to offer consumers another convenience, Mr. Yang does not say in his patent how financial institutions and state licensing agencies would be enticed to join forces, considering they serve different purposes and have different eligibility requirements.
Mr. Yang does note in his patent that the card could be used in automatic teller machines.
And he suggests that when stopped by the police for a traffic violation, the holder could charge any fine to his credit card on the spot.
Cards that are used a lot or carried in back-pocket wallets are sometimes bent.
Then the magnetic strip can't be read, or the damaged card is confiscated by a cash machine.
That is because the deformed card will not travel over a tiny ramp inside most credit card readers and processing machines.
James Johnson, from Lake Forest, Calif., has patented the addition of a curved deflector to the inside of standard credit and smart card reading machines.
Normally, a card is inserted through a slot and the leading edge travels up a tiny ramp.
If the card misses the ramp, it just keeps going.
It does not stop at the point where other cards are processed and then spit back out.
Since the machine cannot return the card, it keeps it (defying the impression most people have that such confiscation is malevolent).
In his invention, the deflector acts as a kind of guide.
When a bent card is inserted, the deflector catches it.
Its curved surface forces the card onto the little ramp so it will follow the correct route to the stopping point.
Joliet's casinos attract 400,000 visitors a month.
As the city's biggest employers, with 3,400 workers, the casinos pay $100 million in wages and have helped drive unemployment down to 6 percent.
The city has used its flush treasury to wipe out its debt, cut its share of homeowner taxes by 30 percent, freeze water fees and eliminate a $25 tax on automobiles.
With subsidies and tax breaks, it has lured a 75,000-seat Nascar race track to its outskirts.

''We have fought so hard to overcome the prison reputation,'' said John M. Mezera, Joliet's city manager.
Today, banners on telephone poles proclaim Joliet a finalist in the All-American City competition.
''We're finally feeling it.''
People here acknowledge that the transformation has come with costs.
Schools and jails are bursting, and the city's rapid sprawl is gobbling surrounding farmland.
Roads are torn up, clogged with traffic, detour signs and digging machines.
''There's been a profound change in how we look at ourselves,'' said Stephen Belford, a lawyer downtown.
''We were always trying to achieve something better, to move on up.''
But with the gambling-driven spread of new subdivisions, ''we've become an advocate of suburban sprawl.''
There are social costs, too, both here and in the surrounding towns, where Gamblers Anonymous groups have cropped up as fast as the subdivisions.
But to some people here, concerns about sprawl and out-of-control gamblers seem a luxury, compared with the dark days before the casinos.
With nine riverboat casinos, including the Empress and Harrah's in Joliet, the Chicago region has become the nation's third-largest gambling area, after Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
Illinois's plunge into gambling came in response to fears that it would lose businesses to neighboring Iowa, which legalized riverboat gambling in 1990.
Later that year, the Illinois Legislature approved casino gambling in its rusting river towns.

Within weeks, casino companies were courting Illinois cities like Joliet, Aurora, Alton and East St. Louis.
The typical gambler here lives 25 miles away and does not leave the casinos to patronize the city's merchants, according to the latest state gambling data.
He or she loses money -- an average of $125.45 per visitor at Harrah's in April, the state data show -- and then is directed by signs in the casinos' garages to Interstate 80, the fastest road out.
The city charges a dollar-a-head admission tax from the casinos and another tax on the money wagered, collecting more than $200 million over nine years -- and currently $30 million a year.
Though the downtown is lined with abandoned stores, the canal has been cleaned.
Nobody calls it the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal anymore; it is the Des Plaines River.
Ground has been broken on a minor league baseball stadium.
Renovation of the abandoned Louis Joliet Hotel into 60 apartments is under way, and a sports bar will soon open in the restored but still barren Union Station.

''We're becoming an entertainment venue, a destination place,'' said James M. Haller, director of community and economic development.
To aid growth, the city has been pushing water and sewer lines into cheap farmland where developers have been caving subdivisions of three- and four-bedroom homes that sell for $100,000 to $200,000, well below prices closer to Chicago.
When it gets high enough, you get all the good things.''
The next good thing, he said, might be a Starbucks.
Yet the homeowners, predominantly young families, sell almost as fast as they buy, said Doug Geissler, a real estate broker.
''There's a ton of turnover,'' he said.
''Developers want to develop every square foot in sight,'' Mr. Geissler said.
''The houses they're throwing up now -- three-inch walls.
People don't care about how the houses are built.''

Joseph L. Mikan, chief executive of Will County, whose hub is Joliet, said: ''You have to question the quality of life.
People have the idea that they're getting into the country, and all of a sudden they see home developers with 100 and 150 acres who put 400 homes on them, or more.''
He doubts that he and his wife and their children will be there for long.
Some longer-term residents of Joliet are worried about other, less visible problems associated with the gambling boom.
In Chicago and its surroundings, compulsive gamblers attend weekly Gamblers Anonymous meetings in 43 communities, all of which have opened since riverboat gambling began in Joliet.
Tom, an automobile sales manager who is in his mid-50's, attends every Monday at Joliet's First Presbyterian church.
Attendance, he said, has climbed from 3 or 4 six years ago to more than 20.
Experts say that addicted and pathological gamblers make up 2 to 5 percent of all gamblers; 2 percent of the 400,000 admissions to the Joliet casinos is 8,000.
Three years ago in Joliet alone, John Renzi, a lawyer here who specializes in personal bankruptcy, said he would file three or four gambling-related bankruptcy petitions a year.
''Now,'' he said, ''it's one a month.''
Patrick O'Neil, coroner of Will County, attributes ''eight or nine'' suicides in the 90's to gambling.
Dr. Alex Spadoni, a psychiatrist who specializes in addiction treatment at Provena St. Joseph's Medical Center in Joliet, said he saw several gambling-related suicide attempts a year.
''They don't say they gamble,'' said Kim McCarl, a counselor at the Family Counseling Agency for Will and Grundy Counties in Joliet, which helps debt-ridden clients come to grips with their bills.
''They say, 'My interest rates on my credit cards are so high I need help paying them off.'
Then you see a huge cash advance on the bottom.
You ask why.
'Oh, I go to the boats.'
''
Mimi Kambic, the agency's credit counseling manager, said, ''The problem we see -- people don't see they have a problem.
We know it's out there, but they're not coming to us for assistance yet.''

She said, ''We're trying to make Joliet the not-the-prison town, and to be known for riverboats.
I don't know if that's so good either.''
Lehman Brothers Holdings, a smaller firm that, like Goldman, has remained independent amid a wave of consolidation, reported a 14 percent increase in net income, to $430 million.
''When the markets are doing well, Goldman will outperform.
Unfortunately, on the downside there's more downside.''
''The short-term outlook for our industry is very uncertain,'' said David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer.
''In the long term, we continue to be quite optimistic.
The question is when the near term will turn into the long term.''
''The I.P.O.
market, as well as the secondary market for stocks, is looking shaky,'' Mr. Goldfarb said.
''We know it will pick up again.''
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the biggest United States securities firm and Goldman's fiercest rival, is scheduled to report earnings on June 21.
Unlike several other Wall Street firms, Lehman has not resorted to laying off large numbers of investment bankers or traders.
Most of that expansion will be in Europe, despite the disappointing drop in underwriting activity and mergers there so far this year, he said.

Goldman had more flexibility in adjusting pay because, he said, ''we do not offer multiyear pay guarantees.''
Over all, Goldman's profitability dropped significantly, resulting in a return on equity of 17.7 percent.

Goldman earned $1.06 a share, compared with $1.48 a fully diluted share, in the second quarter of 2000.
Investors reacted more strongly to Lehman's surprisingly strong performance, including its return on equity of 23.4 percent.
''The businesses that are under the most pressure right now are not the businesses that were Lehman's forte,'' Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
''The extent to which they can become stronger in them represents upside not downside.''
British interest rates are likely to remain steady or rise after the Bank of England's monetary policy committee voted 8-to-1 to keep the benchmark rate at 5.25 percent this month.

Despite new warnings about corporate earnings shortfalls and reports showing that the economy remains weak, many stocks ended the week modestly higher, buoyed by expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates when it meets this week.
The Oracle Corporation said it would beat expectations for the second quarter.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose slightly, finishing at 1,225.35, up 10.99 points, or 0.9 percent.
Only the Dow industrials fell, finishing at 10,604.59, down 19.05, or 0.2 percent.
In the bond markets, comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that inflation remains moderate lifted expectations for a half-point cut in interest rates.

''I have on occasion said to my wife that I couldn't have imagined in the late 1960's, as I was studying monetary policy and what it should and shouldn't be doing, that I would actually be sitting around the table, talking to and briefing the people making that policy.''
Throughout Mr. Greenspan's 14-year tenure as Fed chairman, Mr. Kohn has counseled the central bank's board of governors on monetary policy and in recent years has emerged as the most influential of the 220 economists who serve on the Fed's staff in Washington.
Now, as he works with Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials to keep the slowing economy from sinking into recession, Mr. Kohn is leaving his position in monetary affairs to take on an amorphous but potentially more influential role as adviser to the central bank's board.
The change is intended to give Mr. Kohn more time to act as a sounding board, researcher and intellectual sparring partner for Mr. Greenspan and the Fed's other governors as they seek to understand the changing economy and the ways interest rate policy can affect it.

He will also continue to play a role in drafting testimony, speeches and the statements the Fed issues each time it meets to reconsider interest rates.
(Whether Mr. Kohn contributes to Mr. Greenspan's often tortured syntax and studied ambiguity or fights to minimize them remains their secret.)
''My expertise is in taking the inputs from other people and trying to figure out the monetary policy implications, the strategy and tactics of policy under these circumstances,'' Mr. Kohn said.
''That's what I'd like to have more time to think about.''
There has long been speculation and debate among Fed watchers about the degree of influence exerted by staff members over Mr. Greenspan and the other governors.
Inside the Fed, some governors have complained that the staff was controlled too much by Mr. Greenspan.
Unlike the governors, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, staff members are not subject to direct public oversight.
But they participate in the most secret debates in an institution that does most of its work behind closed doors.

''I don't recognize the caricature of the powerful Fed staff members, the barons, who dictate policy to board members,'' he said.
''That just has never happened, at least while I've been in a position to observe what's happening.
Board members have their own views.
They can and do ask us from time to time, 'What would you do in this situation?'
But it's always very clear in the end who's making the decision, which is appropriate legally and constitutionally.''
''It's not just facts, but a judgment as to why the facts are what they are,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
''As a consequence, he has a fairly significant influence because we trust his judgment.
I've been working with him for 14 years, and his judgment has stood up against reality remarkably well.''
Mr. Kohn has two grown children and a grandson.
His wife, Gail, runs a retirement community in Virginia.
He moved to the Fed in 1975, and has worked his way up, enjoying the combination of an intellectual challenge equal to that in any academic institution while facing the ultimate real-world challenge for an economist.
''If you are interested in making macroeconomic policy and helping to improve this economy, to make it work as well as it can,'' Mr. Kohn said, ''there is no more relevant place than the Federal Reserve system.''

Now people say, 'What's my catalyst?'
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.23 percent from 5.22 percent on Tuesday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
High Price: 99.781
High Yield: 3.990%
Low Yield: 3.900%
Median Yield: 3.968%
Accepted at low price: 74%
Total applied for: $28,559,898
Accepted: $14,666,746
Noncompetitive: $1,100,061
Interest set at: 3 7/8
The two-year notes mature June 30, 2003.
Since sales began 10 months ago, 225 units have been sold to people with annual incomes ranging from $31,000 to $147,750, per apartment.
Apartment buyers must put up $4,533 to $15,393 in cash, depending on the size and location of the apartments.
Buyers then owe a proportionate share of the building's underlying mortgage, ranging from $113,000 to $381,831.
Buyers pay the balance of the purchase price as part of their monthly fees, which include maintenance, and range from $794 to $2,696.
Interest paid on the mortgage is tax-deductible.

Mr. Levine said that to help quell community concerns over gentrification, half the units were being sold to buyers from Harlem.
He is trading his one-bedroom rental on 104th Street and Manhattan Avenue for a three-bedroom unit at the Renaissance.
Mr. Barrow said he is also betting on Harlem's future, ''because there are no other areas left in Manhattan to develop.''
Prices for the apartments have been kept low in part by having individual buyers take advantage of the below-market rate for the buildingwide mortgage, and in part by property-tax abatements.
The building's $46.3 million mortgage, primarily from the New York City Housing Development Corporation, carries a 6.65 percent interest rate.
Property taxes have been waived for 21 years, and will then be phased in.
The monthly payment would be $900 for an 850-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment with a down payment of $5,138 and a proportionate share of the underlying mortgage of $129,000.
That covers taxes, operating expenses and the payment on the underlying mortgage.

Using this financing method, buyers do not need to secure separate mortgages for their apartments, on which the interest rate would have been significantly higher.
Buyers who sell their units at a profit must split the profits with the city, which will use the proceeds to reduce the underlying mortgage.
The Renaissance was developed under the city's Anchor Program, which is aimed at spurring retail growth in areas where the city invested heavily in housing.
Its sponsors include the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York City Housing Partnership.
''It is the first significant activity along 116th Street for some time and we expect it to be a catalyst for other development,'' said Jerilyn Perine, commissioner of the city's housing preservation department.
Of the 11 other Anchor projects, 3 more will be in Harlem and produce 647 condominium apartments and 174,000 square feet of retail space.
The next is to start this summer on Fifth Avenue between 115th and 116th Streets and will have 25,000 square feet of stores and 128 condos.

The Renaissance, designed by Greenberg Farrow Architecture of Manhattan, has amenities like a laundry room and a landscaped courtyard.

And a related company, the World Cruise Company, had gone out of business in May 2000 after stranding some 140 passengers in Tahiti on a round-the-world cruise.
World Cruise's principals were Sam Blyth, the chairman, who also owns a travel agency in Toronto, and Dugald Wells, president.
He and Mr. Blyth -- who, according to The Globe and Mail in Toronto, had no connection to the reorganized company -- have been charged with violating the Ontario Travel Industry Act for not registering as travel agents or wholesalers for the previous Marine Expeditions.
A Similar Situation
Michael Driscoll, the editor of Cruise Week, which covers the cruise industry, said Marine Expeditions was not alone in experiencing weak bookings.

The best way for passengers to protect themselves, Mr. Driscoll said, is to pay for cruises with a major credit card, sail out of American ports (where fares and deposits are covered by the Federal Maritime Commission) or, if sailing from a foreign port, seek trip-cancellation insurance offered directly or through travel agents by major independent companies; these include Travel Guard, CSA Travel Protection and Access America.
If those companies don't offer the insurance for a particular ship, cruise line or voyage, ''it's probably better not to take that cruise because it may be a sign of trouble,'' he said.
''But NMAC has never tolerated unfair treatment of any of its customers, let alone racial discrimination,'' Ms. Dickerson said.

Nissan, like other auto lenders, lets car dealers make the final decision about how much customers pay for loans.
But class-action lawsuits filed in Nashville against the Nissan loan unit and the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, as well as similar suits against other auto lenders, argue that the lenders are responsible if dealers set rates in a racially disparate way.
None of the companies are accused of racial bias -- indeed, both sides agree that the giant lenders do not even know the race of the customers whose cars they finance.
Rather, the plaintiffs argue that the lenders' credit policies, for whatever reason, are having a statistically disparate impact on blacks.
If they can prove that, the legal burden shifts to the lenders, who must then show a valid business need for the policies, which cannot be met in a less harmful way.
Indeed, one expert who examined the new data for the plaintiffs in the Nissan case suggests that some, though not all, of the racial disparity in loan charges may be an unintended result of limits NMAC puts on certain kinds of loans -- loans that go disproportionately to white borrowers.
Other contributing factors, he said, may be simple racial bias among dealers or an assumption among dealers that blacks will be less likely than whites to balk at higher credit prices.
The plaintiffs for whom these new studies were done are challenging the industrywide practice of letting car dealers rather than lenders make the final decision about the interest rate customers will be charged on car loans arranged through their dealer.
Similar fair-lending cases have been filed since October by black consumers against the financing arms of Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Toyota.
Lenders like NMAC allow dealers to add several percentage points, known as the dealer markup, to whatever interest rate Nissan has established for customers based on their income and credit history.
That becomes the rate quoted to the customer, who has no way of learning of the disparity.
The lender then splits the money generated by those extra percentage points with the dealer.
Dealer markup is a big-ticket issue for the industry, and the new Nissan data show why.
Based on fee-splitting formulas in place during much of that time, the dealers' aggregate share would have been roughly three times that amount.
Based on the new data on Nissan -- the only lender that has provided such information so far in the cases -- lawyers for the black consumers are now seeking a preliminary injunction that would prevent Nissan from continuing to participate in dealer-markup arrangements nationwide.

NMAC has argued that any action should be postponed until a decision is reached in its appeal of an order certifying the class action.
Auto finance companies say that the dealer-markup system, besides generating revenue, allows lenders to compete for fresh business from car dealers, who can steer a customer's loan application to any of a number of financing outlets.
Dealers say their share of the markup compensates them for providing customers with one-stop shopping and access to a broader spectrum of lenders than the consumer could command alone.
And the lenders themselves have argued in court that they are not responsible if the markup system is being applied in a racially discriminatory way by some car dealers.
That argument has been challenged by the Justice Department, which last fall filed a brief for the plaintiffs arguing that federal fair-lending laws hold lenders responsible for the actions of the dealers to whom they grant discretion.

A spokeswoman declined to comment on the case pending in Los Angeles against Toyota.
Chrysler Financial did not respond to questions about the case pending against it in New Jersey.
As the most mature of the pending lawsuits, the NMAC case remains the bellwether in the battle over the dealer markup system.
And the new studies pose a roster of fresh questions about the practice.
Professor Cohen cites, as an example, the case of two Louisiana women who purchased Nissan Sentras last year.
Nissan also permits dealers to move approved customers from a higher credit classification to a lower one, which has the effect of raising the customer's interest rate.
NMAC established a limit on how much dealer markup can be imposed for each credit tier -- and policies like that may be inadvertently contributing to the racial disparity that shows up in the loan data, according to Ian Ayres, a lawyer and economist who is a professor at Yale Law School.
Professor Ayres, who has conducted several widely cited studies on car retailing over the past decade, examined the new Nissan data for the plaintiffs in the NMAC case.
Because whites are more likely than blacks to be placed in that tier, that limitation has the side effect of reducing the markup paid by whites.
Similarly, NMAC allows greater markup on loans of longer duration.
Because blacks tend to borrow for a slightly longer term than whites, this too can contribute to the higher markups they pay.
Finally, NMAC often imposed lower markup caps on loans for new cars, which whites are more likely to buy than blacks.
But Professor Ayres noted that there was no business justification for allowing dealers, who have no money at risk in the transaction, to impose a higher markup based on factors such as the credit tier, the loan term or the age of the car.

''None of these selective markup caps are justified by the dealerships' costs of arranging and or processing loan applications,'' Professor Ayres noted in his study.

Ponson was gone with a blister on his pitching hand after two innings and Clemens pitched into the seventh, struggling a bit with the footing on the wet mound, struggling to maintain a feel for the dampened baseballs.
Clemens has pitched into at least the sixth inning in all of his starts this year.
Clemens retired the Orioles in order in the sixth, striking out two more; he finished the game with six strikeouts, giving him 122 for the season and 3,626 for his career, 14 short of Tom Seaver, who ranks fourth.

A governor-appointed board has stopped financing four programs at law schools that offer free legal assistance primarily to poor illegal immigrants, drawing complaints from immigration rights advocates who fear that hundreds of people will be left in the lurch.
Representatives of the law school programs said today that the fellows, all practicing lawyers assisted by professors and student interns, have served hundreds of clients since then, handling such things as asylum applications, small claims court cases, landlord-tenant disputes and a few class-action challenges to immigration rules.
The vast majority of the clients have been undocumented immigrants.
The four programs are the Hudson Valley Poverty Law Center at Pace University here; the Touro Social Justice Project at Touro Law Center on Long Island; Brooklyn Law School, and Syracuse University College of Law.

The state financing ended on June 30, but the programs are carrying on with leftover funds that soon will be depleted.
To keep the programs running, advocates have begun asking politicians and others with influence to help find other money or overturn the decision.
''We're kind of reeling from the decision,'' said Jennifer B.
Brown of the Hudson Valley Poverty Law Center, which has 40 to 50 cases a year.
Craig Siegel, associate counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, said that immigrants outside New York City might be hit the hardest because there are few if any alternatives for free legal assistance in suburban or rural areas.
''There is going to be virtually nobody available to help them,'' he said.
The board, created in 1983, disburses about $12 million annually from the interest derived from small, temporary escrow accounts private lawyers set up for clients as part of their cases.
The amount of money has decreased from a high of $24 million in 1992 because of the decline in interest rates.

The board put a total of six programs, including the four legal assistance programs, on notice last December that they would receive financing for only six months this year pending a review of their programs.Those evaluations came back favorable.
George E. Pataki, a Republican, curious because Mr. Pataki has generally taken a pro-immigration stance.
The 15 board trustees are appointed by the governor; seven through his own discretion and the remainder on the recommendation of the leaders of the Assembly and Senate and the chief judge of the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court.
The money that would have gone to the five programs will be distributed among the other 85 programs that were funded, he said.
he said, adding: ''It's a Hobson's choice.
There are no bad programs.
We wish we could meet all the needs but we simply do not have all the funds to do that.''
The board may receive an additional $1 million in funding this year because of a change in bank rules, but Mr. Nojay would not say whether any of the money would be used for the discontinued programs.
Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki said: ''We're confident that the board is committed to using its resources as effectively as possible and targeting those resources toward groups that have demonstrated the clear ability to help as many low income New Yorkers as possible.''

But it is not that people here have necessarily changed their views about dams.
Rather, they say they have been forced by the state's seemingly limitless need for cleaner and more plentiful water to at least consider something that had been anathema a short while ago.
''But we're willing to take a serious look, as long as there are thorough studies.''
Other environmentalists think the willingness to consider new dams is a slippery slope.
The focus of the program is one of the largest and most overtaxed systems of natural and man-made plumbing in the world, the 700-square mile Bay Delta.
It is where the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers meet the eastern reaches of the San Francisco Bay in a maze of channels, aqueducts, oxbows, dams, islands and wetlands.
The delta has provided most of the water for California's growth for more than 100 years.
It now supplies water for 22 million people -- mostly in Southern California -- and irrigates 4.5 million acres of some of the most productive farmland in the country.
It is the largest estuary on the West Coast, with a watershed that drains roughly 40 percent of the state.
It is also the state's largest habitat for fish and wildlife, including two-thirds of the state's salmon.
Environmentalists and others, warning that the canal could have a devastating impact on the lower reaches of the delta, fought vigorously and successfully to stop the construction.
Not a single comprehensive water project has gone forward since then, and in the meantime water quality has declined, a number of species have become endangered, including salmon and the delta smelt, and the farmers and cities have complained that they have had to make do with less water.
Realizing that only compromises and sacrifices could break the logjam, more than a dozen federal and state agencies, as well as agricultural groups, urban water districts and environmentalists, began, starting in the early 1990's, a long process of study and debate.
Last summer they reached a historic consensus, agreeing to spend $8.6 billion in the first seven years, and more over the next two decades to revitalize the delta water system.
The majority of the money would come from the federal government, and the rest from the state.
The plan envisions that over time the users of the water, particularly farmers, will pay the full cost of their allotment without subsidies, but this is uncertain.
The agreement, called the Cal Fed program, contains gains and sacrifices for just about everyone.
Farmers would get less water than at times in the past, but the deliveries would be more reliable.
Urban areas would get cleaner water, but less of it.
Environmentalists would see areas like the lower McCloud inundated, but the tradeoff would be more clean water flushing through the lower delta, helping revive endangered species.
There would also be better flood control, more water for use in droughts and new money for water conservation and recycling.

''The Bay Delta system is clearly being maintained at a very low level, and everyone recognizes that we don't know if it can sustain another serious drought,'' said Patrick Wright, the Cal Fed director.
''So everyone wants to move forward, and they're willing to consider things they would never have thought about before as long as it all moves forward together.''

But the fragile consensus is being strained.
Many of those involved are troubled by the compromises, and some groups have gone to Congress, which would have to rule on legislation to carry out the program, to try to regain some of what they had given up in the Cal Fed framework.
Supporters of the program say that because it relies on a vast web of compromises, picking apart pieces of it could bring the effort down.
''This is the most sweeping water policy and restoration policy program ever in this state,'' said Mary Nichols, the state's secretary for resources.
''We're committed to the whole program rather than pieces.
If not you run the risk of running off the rails, which would lead us back toward the old water wars, even within the federal government.''
The last major dam built in California was the New Melones Dam on the Stanislaus River in the 1970's, which environmentalists fought.
Since then, not only have a handful of smaller dams been torn down, but the few new dams have generally involved a new generation of technology; water is diverted from rivers, usually just at flush times, and stored in off-stream reservoirs, causing less disruption to the ecosystem.
Many of the Cal Fed dams would fit this model.
One subject of debate is how quickly the dam projects should be built.
Both have been harshly criticized by environmental groups that accuse them of moving too swiftly on the dams.
By contrast, the Cal Fed program proposes studies of the expansion of the Shasta and several other dams, and construction only if the economics and environmental issues balance out.
And while the program generally offers the agricultural groups only commitments to try to provide a steadier flow of water, the two bills offer statutory guarantees.
Representative George Miller, a Democrat whose district east of Oakland includes one of the dams that would be enlarged, has now offered a third bill that he says would bring the legislation closer to the Cal Fed agreement.
But even Mr. Miller, who has solid environmental credentials, admitted that the dams and their destructive consequences, have to be seriously considered.
''It may be a price that has to be paid,'' said Mr. Miller, referring to the impact on the McCloud.
It is still hard for some people to imagine paying that price.
On a drizzly morning on the lower McCloud, not far from where it spills into the huge Lake Shasta, a majestic scene that plays out day after day unfolded.
A bald eagle suddenly appeared, patrolling the narrow canyon from above, while wild brown trout darted under the perfect crystal blue waters.
If the dam is raised and the canyon flooded there would be more room for houseboats and more lake beaches.

''This is not an economically vibrant area, so we could use the jobs,'' said Mr. Knight, the regional manager for California Trout.
''But look at this, look at what you'd lose.
And I can tell you, people here hate the idea of inundating a couple miles of river just to send the water to Southern California.
They hate it.''
''There's this idea that everybody can win,'' Mr. Graff said.
''We'll clean the delta and get more water to urban districts and the farmers.
I think that that's just wrong.
You can't do that.''
And some of the most powerful farm groups are already threatening the equivalent of a nuclear strike, litigation, if they do not get the guarantees they have been demanding.
''I don't think it's a question of what we would be prepared to do.
It's what we would have to do.''
That kind of talk worries people like Mr. Miller.
The consequences are huge if this process comes apart.''
President Bush filled another vacancy at the Federal Reserve today, saying he would nominate Mark W. Olson, a former president of the American Bankers Association, to the central bank's governing board.
Mr. Olson has long experience in banking issues, and is expected to play a role in the Fed's regulation of the financial services industry.
If confirmed by the Senate, he would fill a term that expires in 2010.
But he is not an economist, and it is unclear what views he will bring to the Fed's consideration of interest rate policy and its assessments of an economy that is being reshaped by forces like technology and globalization.
There is still one vacancy to be filled, and early next year another term will expire, giving Mr. Bush a chance to fill five seats on the Fed board in his first year in office.

But in his selection of Mr. Olson, as in his nomination of Ms. Bies, Mr. Bush seemed to choose financial expertise over ideology or economic philosophy.
Neither appointment seems likely to result in any challenge to the dominant position of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, on monetary policy, or even to inject a well-established economic voice into the debate.
Mr. Greenspan, who has led the Fed since 1987, has at times used his clout to influence nominations, most recently with his open support for the reappointment of Mr. Ferguson as vice chairman.

It is not clear what role, if any, Mr. Greenspan had in the choice of Mr. Olson.
A spokesman for the Fed would say only that board members are nominated by the president.
The White House considered several other bankers for the slot, including Terry Jorde, president of CountryBank USA, a small bank in North Dakota, government officials have said.
Bankers welcomed Mr. Olson's selection to the Fed, which is as influential as a financial regulator as it is in setting interest rates.
''Mark is known throughout the banking industry for his thoughtful, practical approach to banking and financial issues,'' said Don G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the bankers' association.
''His work as a community banker, as president of A.B.A.
and at Ernst & Young has showcased Mark's versatility and strategic thinking.''
The seven seats on the Fed's board each carry 14-year terms, with one of the terms expiring every two years.
When a seat becomes vacant before the term ends, as is common, the new nominee fills the remainder of the term.
''I would just say it is a function of contagion,'' said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. ''Argentina is sending a shiver through investors' mindset.''
The fear among investors is that Argentina will actually default on its $130 billion of foreign debt or force investors into a restructuring that would reduce what Argentina owes.
And many analysts doubt that the government will be able to cut spending enough to offset the fall in tax revenues, after three years of recession, and leave enough to meet foreign debt payments.
Many analysts doubt that such cuts are possible given Argentina's complex politics and the approach of elections in October.

While it may seem odd for the dollar to fall when investors are nervous, it can happen.
First, the dollar has been incredibly strong this year, especially given the slowdown in economic growth in the United States and the six cuts in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
Secondly, a lot of this strength has come from foreigners, Europeans and Japanese, betting that both the euro and the yen would continue to decline against the dollar.
But these bets on the dollar, Mr. Gilmore said, leave these investors in risky positions from their point of view.
So when there is uncertainty in the outlook, reducing their risk a little means selling the dollar to buy back euros or yen.
Besides affecting the dollar, the fallout from Argentina is also reaching American banks that have exposure there and in other emerging markets.
In just over two weeks the political and financial crisis in Argentina has worsened enough to send interest rates on three-month bills up to 14 percent from 9.1 percent.
In that same two week period, two of the American banks that have big exposure there, Citibank and J. P. Morgan Chase & Company, have seen their stocks drop.
J. P. Morgan Chase is off 5.9 percent for the two weeks.
Stock prices surged in a powerful rally yesterday, sending the Nasdaq up 5.26 percent.
The rally came after Microsoft said that its second-quarter revenue would be moderately higher than Wall Street's forecasts, giving investors some hope that the worst might be over for corporate profits.
The news was greeted warmly by investors, who have been besieged over the last month by corporate warnings of profit shortfalls.
''In a normal market environment, none of this news would be considered particularly positive.''

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 237.97 points, or 2.32 percent, to 10,478.99.
The company added that it would be ''slightly profitable'' in the fourth quarter, although it would have a loss in the third quarter.

Disappointing economic news was basically ignored on Wall Street yesterday.
Despite investors' enthusiasm yesterday, analysts said stocks would probably remain in a trading range until companies show sustained improvement in their earnings.
''I'd love to see this be the start of something real and carry us all the way to the end of the year,'' he said, ''but I just think that we have more work to do.''
''The situation in Argentina looks pretty ugly,'' said Mitch Stapley, who helps manage $4 billion at Fifth Third Investment Advisors in Grand Rapids, Mich.
The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.23 percent from 5.28 percent on Wednesday.
Excluding vehicles, retail sales declined in June by 0.2 percent.
As a result, economists now estimate that overall consumer spending grew at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent in the second quarter.
Economists at Chase are among the nation's most optimistic forecasters, and Mr. Glassman added that retail sales are ''not weak enough to dampen expectations that we are going to see a revival of consumer spending.''
Spending depends on consumer confidence and that edged up in July, according to a preliminary reading from the University of Michigan's consumer survey group.
Its index of consumer sentiment, which has been gradually rebounding since April, rose to 93.7 from 92.6 in May.

''They see their incomes purchasing more as inflation weakens in the year ahead, mainly as a result of declining energy prices,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the surveys.
''High-income families, on the other hand, focused on what has happened in the stock market; their wealth shrank'' and so did their confidence.
The Producer Price Index, measuring the cost of goods as they move through the production process, from raw materials to finished goods, fell in June.
The index for finished goods -- covering all types of merchandise, including gasoline -- fell by 0.4 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
Excluding energy, the so-called core index rose a scant 0.1 percent, the same as in May.
The Consumer Price Index for June, a much broader measure covering price changes for services as well as goods, will be released on Wednesday and most forecasters expect only a small rise.
That would give the Federal Reserve's policy makers room for another cut in interest rates at their August meeting.
It would be the seventh cut this year.
The goal is to stimulate consumer spending and business investment, without pushing up the inflation rate.
''Goods prices pose no threat to inflation in the United States now or in the foreseeable future,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics, told clients yesterday.
The new reports yesterday were only the latest evidence of persisting economic weakness.
Inventories of unsold merchandise have declined more slowly than expected, delaying the day that manufacturers will have to lift production to meet demand.
And there were reports last week of weak profits, raising concerns that companies will step up layoffs to cut costs, frightening consumers.
The still unanswered question, said William Dudley, chief domestic economist at Goldman, Sachs, is whether rising layoffs ''will cause consumers to cut spending and generate a full-blown recession.''
Mr. Katz, 39, is chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, the fund's adviser, which also manages about $750 million in value investments for institutions and individuals.

To choose stocks for the fund, he starts by screening 8,000 companies, most of them in the United States, with market capitalizations ranging from $1 billion to $100 billion.
He looks for companies with above-average earnings growth that have below-market price-to-earnings ratios.
He also calculates an intrinsic value for each company, based on its long-term earnings growth rate and projected earnings over the next three years or so, and aims to buy companies selling for at least a 33 percent discount to that value.
Over all, companies in the portfolio have projected earnings growth of 12 percent over the next three to five years.
On average, they sell for 16.6 times estimated 2001 earnings, compared with a multiple of 22 for the index.
''When we buy companies for well below the market and their own historic valuation parameters, we have a margin of safety built into the price,'' Mr. Katz said.
To find companies with shareholder-friendly management, he pores over five years of company annual reports, proxies and other financial statements.
Mr. Katz looks for companies with short-term economic, operating, regulatory or other problems -- actual or perceived -- then decides how likely they are to be resolved successfully.
He likes companies with debt-to-capitalization ratios of 45 percent or less.
''If they have strong balance sheets, they may be able to muddle through their problems,'' he said.
TO control risk, he limits purchases of any one stock to 4 percent of total assets and trims a holding as its value approaches 6 percent of the portfolio.
Turnover is 40 percent, compared with more than 100 percent for stock funds in general.

He believes that his investment in ''high-quality technology companies at bargain-basement prices has positioned the portfolio for very favorable returns in the upcoming 6 to 12 months as the economy recovers and technology spending returns to more normal levels.''
''It's a blue-chip company that dominates the printer industry and is a strong player in other areas,'' he said.

He expects improvement in the company's stock price over the next 6 to 12 months.
''We think they have a great brand name and they're in a good industry,'' he said.
The stock now trades at $27.98; his 12-month target price is $48.
Falling interest rates prompted Mr. Katz to buy shares of J. P. Morgan Chase in June, at an average price of $43.62.
''We think the financial group will be the beneficiary of aggressive easing by the Federal Reserve,'' he said.
''Their outlook over the next 6 to 12 months will be aided by improving equity markets.''
His target price for the stock is $65; it now trades at $42.55.
''Schering-Plough has always sold at a premium to the market and to the drug group,'' he said.
''The problem is serious,'' he said, ''but management has been aggressively pursuing it.''
The shares closed at $36.89 on Friday; his target price is $58.
And in business journalism, some companies made it a policy to refuse to speak with Internet news sites, making it a challenge to gather basic information.

All that seems so long ago.
Now a company either talks to an Internet reporter or not, as with any other reporter, after assessing the caliber of the organization the reporter represents.
And journalists move from the Internet to trusted print publications, benefiting from their online experience.
Jesse Eisinger, for instance, cut his teeth covering companies at TheStreet.com and now writes the Heard on the Street column for The Wall Street Journal Europe.
While the early critics fretted, the Internet behaved as an open market should.
(Slate's recent mea culpa over a partially fabricated piece on ''monkey fishing'' is a case in point.)
It's fairly simple, really.
If the news site is not trustworthy, the readers will slip away.
And even though online content businesses have suffered financially, millions of readers have coalesced around a number of high-quality sites.
The readers have learned where they can go to find trustworthy information.
At the same time, they have figured out that online writers like the gossipy Mr. Drudge do not adhere to top-drawer journalistic standards, nor claim to.
Mr. Drudge provides raw, tip-driven tidbits, knowing that many readers have always liked a little whispered chatter with their traditional news.
And presumably, most people go to chat boards understanding that they are becoming involved in nothing more than a barroom conversation.
Sometimes it's interesting; often it's just drivel.
But few would confuse it with news.
Yet, while the Internet has secured its position as a legitimate news medium, there are reasons for concern.
The biggest may be speed.
People want information faster than they did ever before.
The ''news cycle'' seems a quaint idea when stories can erupt, spread and die in a matter of hours.

Of course, readers, listeners and watchers have shown a voracious appetite for rapid dissemination of information for decades.
Radio and television have long fed that appetite in their own characteristic ways, often offering on-the-scene coverage of events, with the facts and interpretation being layered on as they become available.
But the Internet has made it possible to offer a quick first draft of print journalism, a format in which readers have come to expect facts and interpretation.
By requiring a writer to show his or her hand earlier and earlier, the Internet has helped expose the raw nature of the news-gathering process.
And often, that early hand is imperfect.
For print journalists, this new world presents an interesting challenge.
Historically, print reporters have looked down on their broadcast cousins with modest disdain.
The distillation of complex issues into a 30-second broadcast report makes the print journalist think electronic journalists lack analytical heft.
But this disdain can make it difficult for the print people to appreciate the most important skill an electronic journalist possesses: real-time decision making.

I started in journalism at the NBC Radio News network.
In print, the deadline is seldom as immediate.
Ideas can be mulled and debated.
Over time, print journalists involved with Internet distribution must learn to fuse their traditional strengths with the skill of real-time decision making.
Another development in Internet journalism has been the emergence of the small, single-issue or single-person commentary site.
Examples include Kausfiles.com, where Mickey Kaus, a former Newsweek reporter, presents his political opinions, his readers' opinions, media critiques and links to other sites.
Another example is Smartertimes.com, a daily critique of The New York Times, by Ira Stoll, a self-described ''ordinary semi-intelligent guy in Brooklyn who reads the newspaper carefully early each morning.''
Costs for such sites tend to be low, and the readership small, but devoted.
The long-term prospects of these single-issue sites, run more as hobbies than businesses, are hard to forecast.
But the growth of the single-issue or single-person site illustrates how the Internet, as an open market of ideas, breaks down many of the natural barriers that previously enabled editors to dictate much of what would be news for a given day.
Now, Web personalization and self-designed news home pages have created an environment in which readers are helping determine what is vital for them.
But readers still rely heavily on professional editors from trusted news organizations to provide them with local, national and global context.
No longer a worrisome curiosity, the Internet is simply another of the means by which people find out what in the world is going on.
But Bank of New York, which has comparatively little exposure to lending, surprised investors with lower-than-expected earnings.
Citigroup reported earnings before nonrecurring charges and accounting changes of $3.79 billion, or 74 cents a share, a penny ahead of analysts' expectations.
The bank also announced a $133 million after-tax charge ''for severance and other costs in connection with staffing reductions,'' signaling further cost cuts to come.
''This management team knows how to manage costs when the situation calls for it,'' said David Berry, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which specializes in the financial services industry.
It is also ahead of schedule on integrating Associates First Capital, which it acquired last year.

Earnings at Citigroup's global corporate and investment banking division were $919 million, up just 2 percent from a year earlier.
Citigroup's performance looks reasonably strong compared with some others on Wall Street, he said.
This year's results were 6 cents ahead of analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
''The consumer side has been very strong,'' said James H. Hance Jr., chief financial officer of Bank of America, in an interview yesterday.
''For banks without exposure to that business, it can be a problem.
It helps cover costs on the corporate side.''

The bank's lending business has been hurt in recent quarters by large increases in problem loans.
Bank of America's nonperforming assets increased by 5 percent from the first quarter, which is much better than the 15 percent to 20 percent increase he had forecast.
''A lot of people have been worried about credit quality at Bank of America,'' Mr. Kraushaar said.
''For the short term, they are reassured.''
Still, given that the economy is still weak, ''the jury is still out for the second half of the year,'' he said.
Bank of America has successfully capitalized on consumers' hunt for a safe haven from the stock market.
The bank's average deposits increased by 3 percent, with money market savings account balances rising 19 percent.
Its share of high yield bond underwritings nearly doubled, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.
The story was different at Bank of New York, which derives most of its earnings from securities processing.
The bank reported earnings of $385 million, or 52 cents a share, up 8 percent from the prior year, but a penny shy of analyst expectations, according to First Call.
Mr. Cavallo's new plan is intended to avert a default by cutting government salaries and pensions by up to 13 percent to eliminate the projected $1.5 billion government deficit for the second half of the year.
It follows a potpourri of other policies that have included increases in some taxes, decreases in others, higher tariffs for some goods, lower tariffs for others, multiple exchange rates and a crackdown on tax evasion.

Mr. Cavallo has paid a personal price for the failing economy.
With his approval in the polls dropping sharply, Mr. Cavallo was depicted on the cover of a major political magazine this week as a weeping clown.
A rap song broadcast on a popular television variety show on Monday night compared his new belt-tightening fiscal measures to a noose contracting around the necks of the working class.
''He's no longer superman but he's still the linchpin of any plan that is to be put together.''
Mr. Cavallo was the designer of the plan, even if he almost torpedoed it by getting into a shouting match with the Buenos Aires governor, Carlos Ruckauf, an opposition leader, over his financial handling of his provincial government.
In contrast to a news media caricature of him as a hyperactive juggernaut, Mr. Cavallo spoke in quiet tones, sipping a cup of herbal tea, his legs crossed in a soft leather chair.

''If they want a default they can provoke one,'' Mr. Cavallo said matter-of-factly, referring to the Wall Street analysts and investors.
''But Argentina will not be the cause of a default, absolutely not.
Argentina will meet its obligations, pay the interest on its debt.''
He also denied that Argentina would devalue its peso, saying such a move would not get to the root of the problem.
In other words we have produced too much public debt just like in the past we printed too much currency.''
''The solution is simple,'' he continued.
''We have to maintain a constant, unchanging stock of debt.''

That kind of economic orthodoxy is a change in emphasis, if not direction, from Mr. Cavallo's previous efforts to spur growth.
The move bewildered Wall Street analysts since such parity is not likely to happen any time soon.
Last month, Mr. Cavallo established a multiple exchange rate for importers and exporters, giving exporters the benefit of approximately an 8 percent subsidy, based on a floating exchange rate that amounts to the average value of the euro and the dollar.
And defying the predictions of virtually every independent economist, he predicted that Argentina could reach a 5 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter of the year if he can manage to calm the bond markets and bring down interest rates to a manageable level.
The signing of the agreement between President Fernando de la Rúa and the opposition governors this morning brought political relief to the struggling government and gains to Argentina's bond and stock markets today.
Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts continued to express concerns that an Argentine default may be unavoidable.
''Argentina has achieved some breathing room, but the medium term outlook remains highly uncertain,'' said a Deutsche Bank report published today.
''Growth should be dismal and tax revenues should suffer.''
Mr. Cavallo shrugged off the Wall Street pessimism, adding, ''Argentina will return to growth and when it does, it will be very vigorous.''
The Fed has already cut its benchmark short-term rate six times this year, by a total of 2.75 percentage points, in its effort to reverse the slowdown and avert the first recession in 11 years.
Bond prices rose on the prospect that the Fed would cut rates next month [Page C8.]
Testifying before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Greenspan balanced an upbeat view of the economy's long-term prospects against a decidedly mixed forecast for the rest of this year and into 2002.
He said the economy should be helped in coming months by a variety of factors.
Inflation, he said, is not a serious threat at the moment.
But he said corporate profits remain under ''unrelenting'' pressure, a factor in the persistent weakness of the stock market.
And he added that one critical issue -- whether companies begin investing again in new factories, computers, telecommunications equipment and other capital goods -- ''could pose a continuing problem.''
Many economists say a steep falloff in capital investment is the primary culprit in the economy's sharp slowdown this year.
Mr. Greenspan said deteriorating growth abroad could also slow the recovery in the United States.
He declined to comment in any substantive way on the persistent strength of the dollar, which has made it difficult for American companies to sell their products abroad and has bitten into earnings at most multinational corporations.
The central bank anticipates economic growth this year of 1.25 percent to 2 percent, implying an annualized growth rate for the second half of the year of around 2 percent.
For next year, the Fed projected growth of 3 percent to 3.25 percent, a reasonably healthy rate but one slightly below what most Fed officials think is the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth.
As long as the economy is growing below its noninflationary potential, unemployment is likely to rise.
The unemployment rate, which is currently 4.5 percent, will edge up to 4.75 percent to 5 percent by the end of the year, the Fed projected, and will continue to rise next year, to as high as 5.25 percent.

Mr. Greenspan's testimony reflected an apparent split within the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in recent months.

One camp has argued that the Fed should give its six rate cuts this year time to work and that further cuts would risk igniting inflation down the road.
Another camp has argued that inflation is dormant and that the Fed should be open to more rate cuts if the economy does not rebound convincingly.
The risks ''would seem to remain mostly tilted toward weakness in the economy,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
In a nod to his own belief that inflation is all but quiescent and is likely to fall even further, leaving room for further rate cuts, he said ''overall prices seem likely to be contained in the period ahead.''
But he also acknowledged the argument that too much easing of monetary policy, and a lack of recognition that it takes time for rate cuts to ripple through the economy, could leave the economy overheated next year and in need of offsetting rate increases.
''Certainly, should conditions warrant, we may need to ease further, but we must not lose sight of the prerequisite of longer-run price stability for realizing the economy's full growth potential over time,'' he said.
Under questioning from members of the committee, Mr. Greenspan avoided being pinned down on when he expected the economy to turn around.
''We are seeing signs that the bottom is beginning to structure itself,'' Mr. Greenspan said in response to one question.
Asked later whether he expected a rebound in the fourth quarter, he replied, ''I think if I had to make a forecast, I would say that towards the end of this year we will see things improving, and clearly so next year.''

In its written monetary policy report to Congress today, the Fed provided an update on its planning for the day when the national debt has been paid down by so much that the central bank will no longer be able to count on using Treasury securities in its open market operations.
Through such operations, the Fed increases or decreases the money supply, pushing short-term interest rates up and down.
The report said the Fed was considering, in ''the near term,'' buying and selling securities issued by Ginnie Mae, a federal agency whose bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the government.
Mr. Greenspan floated the possibility of using Ginnie Mae securities in a speech this spring.
The Fed said it might also engage in repurchase operations in which the collateral is debt issued by foreign governments.
In the longer term, the Fed said it would study whether it could auction credit through its discount window, which has long functioned as an emergency loan facility for the banking system.
And the Fed said it would consider whether it could buy and sell a range of other securities, a step that would require new legal authority from Congress.
Several labor confederations began a crippling 24-hour nationwide strike today to protest the Argentine government's new austerity plan, which cuts public wages and pensions by up to 13 percent to avert a default on foreign debt payments.
Still, the protest by tens of thousands of workers came as more bad news for a government that has been struggling week to week from one financial crisis to another.
The country's largest airline canceled all flights.
''This is a response to the government and a repudiation of the plans that force the least able to pay for the deficit,'' said Hugo Moyano, a leading strike organizer.
''Those who ought to pay are those economic groups that have accumulated the money in our country.''

Government officials were sharply critical of the strike.
''The only route to recuperation in this country is through work,'' said Interior Minister Ramón Mestre.
The country has been in a three-year recession, with bank deposits, foreign reserves, production and consumption falling in recent weeks.
One bright spot has been the recent spike in the price of soy, a major Argentine export.

Fears that Argentina could default on its $130 billion foreign public debt has sent bond and stock prices plummeting and interest rates shooting up in recent weeks.
Some critics have called for a currency devaluation, but government officials have warned that such a move would bankrupt much of the private sector, which has $20 billion in foreign debt, and cause more unemployment.
President de la Rúa has been trying to get leaders of the various parties in his center-left coalition government behind his plan and to compel 14 opposition governors to cut their own budget deficits.
Buenos Aires Province, the country's largest, is already near bankruptcy and is paying its public workers their seasonal bonuses in bonds rather than currency.

With most second-quarter earnings reports already out, the release of hearty economic data earlier in the week and the hope that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates when it meets on Aug. 21, better days may be ahead, some analysts said.
''What's different this time is that it's the professional that has had the knee-jerk reaction to the ongoing pressure, and the individual investor has had the fortitude to hang in there and take the longer-term view,'' said Robert N. Phillips Jr., president and chief investment officer at Walnut Asset Management.
''We are very optimistic about the future,'' he said.
''We think we're in the early stages of putting in a very meaningful bottom and hopefully a new bull market will emerge.''
The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.11 percent from 5.10 percent on Thursday.

Jamaica is a 144-mile mountain range jutting out of the Caribbean.
The capital city of Kingston and the homes of most of the country's 2.5 million inhabitants are on the southern coast.
Nearly all the hotels worth visiting are located a huge mountain and a social world away, on the northern coast.
Jamaica does have a higher level of crime and violence than most other nations, but the violence is largely confined to particular urban neighborhoods in the southern part of the island.
What is really going on here?
Jamaica is a test case of all that's best and worst about democratic regimes in less developed countries.
It shares with most of the other Caribbean islands of the British Commonwealth a deeply rooted commitment to personal freedom and democratic governance.
What's more, unlike Japan and many other modern democracies, Jamaica has repeatedly passed the ultimate test of any thoroughly institutionalized democracy: it has had several changes of government since independence in 1962, the two dominant parties each having ruled and been thrown out of office by the voters about the same number of times.
Supporting this democracy are a free and vigilant press, a sophisticated tradition of social and political discourse, and a vibrant civil society.
The country also has a complex and highly developed popular culture and intellectual tradition.
That's the good news.
The bad news is that Jamaica's attempts at economic development have largely failed.
Here, as in Puerto Rico and most other Caribbean islands, post-independence attempts at industrialization have fallen apart.
Jamaica now has vast shantytowns; unemployment at depression levels; and high rates of economic inequality, crime and drug abuse.
The government has met many conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund in return for much-needed loans: a stable annual inflation rate of 5.8 percent, falling interest rates, adequate international reserves and the return of positive growth.
But at the same time, public debt is nearly 160 percent of the gross domestic product and interest consumes more than half of all government expenditure, leaving little to address the social problems.
The library's break with its long tradition of choosing only dead authors for its series of definitive collections ushered Miss Welty into a pantheon that includes Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Edgar Allan Poe and William Faulkner.
''It is not the South we find in her stories, it is Eudora Welty's South, a region that feeds her imagination and a place we come to trust,'' Maureen Howard said when she reviewed Miss Welty's ''Collected Stories'' in 1980.
''She is a Southerner as Chekhov was a Russian, because place provides them with a reality -- a reality as difficult, mysterious and impermanent as life.''
Still illiterate, I was ready for them, committed to all the reading I could give them.''
Miss Welty learned to read before starting public school and began turning out stories as a child.
I could see the achieved sentence finally standing there, as real, intact and built to stay as the Mississippi State Capitol at the top of my street, where I could walk through it on my way to school and hear underfoot the echo of its marble floor and over me the bell of its rotunda.''
''Listening for them is something more acute than listening to them.
I suppose it's an early form of participation in what goes on.
Listening children know stories are there.
When their elders sit and begin, children are just waiting and hoping for one to come out, like a mouse from its hole.''
The thing to wait on, to reach there in time for, is the moment when you see it.
I knew this, anyway: that my wish, indeed my continuing passion, would be not to point the finger in judgment but to part a curtain, that invisible shadow that falls between people, the veil of indifference to each other's presence, each other's wonder, each other's human plight.''

The first, one of the most popular of the dozens that were to be printed in the years to come, is a first-person explanation by a small-town postmistress of why she is moving out of her eccentric family's home to live at the post office.
The editor and critic James Olney said of ''A Curtain of Green'': ''The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber 'Death of a Traveling Salesman' to the hallucinatory 'Flowers for Marjorie,' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces of 'Clytie' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece, from the jazzy 'Powerhouse' to the satiric 'Petrified Man,' from the wildly comic 'Why I Live at the P.O.'
to the dignified 'A Worn Path' (the 'grave, persistent, meditative' sound of old Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the tone at the outset).''

And they could of all bit a nail in two, especially Stella-Rondo, that it used to belong to, and she well knew she couldn't get it back, I'd sue for it like a shot .

So was her genius for using the details of daily life to illuminate the mysteries of the heart.
Our hands touched.
As a thousand bees had droned and burrowed in the pears that lay on the ground.''
After the deaths of her mother and brothers, she returned in the 70's with the novels ''Losing Battles'' and ''The Optimist's Daughter.''
''The Robber Bridegroom,'' for example, incorporates elements of folklore, fairy tales, classical myths and legends of the Mississippi River and the Natchez Trace, the road of pioneer days that stretched from Natchez, Miss., to Nashville.
In ''Delta Wedding,'' Miss Welty concentrates on the frenzied activities of the extended Fairchild family in the week before the marriage of a daughter to the plantation's overseer, who is considered by several of the Fairchilds to be an intruder unworthy of admission into the family.
Fiction of Family Life
That book, as well as the short novel ''The Ponder Heart'' (1954) and her longest one, ''Losing Battles'' (1970), are examples of Miss Welty's preoccupation with family life.
They focus on weddings, reunions and funerals, which all bring family members together to recall the past, criticize and lavish praise on one another and settle old scores.
Her novels and stories expose the foibles to which large clans are prone, their tendencies to resist change, squelch individuality and ostracize outsiders.
Miss Welty often shifts points of view to accomplish this, but in ''The Ponder Heart,'' she demonstrates her extraordinary ear for dialect and a sense of the ridiculous as she tells the entire story as a comic monologue by Edna Earle Ponder, a garrulous hotel manager.

Commenting on many critics' observations that ''Losing Battles'' and her other works carried a strong sense of place, Miss Welty said: ''I think Southerners have such an intimate sense of place.
We grew up in the fact that we live here with people about whom we know almost everything that can be known as a citizen of the same neighborhood or town.
We learn significant things that way.
We know what the place has made of these people, what they've made of the place through generations.
We have a sense of continuity and that, I think, comes from place.''
And because she was in her particular place in the racially discordant 60's, she said, ''I was one of the writers who received dead-of-night telephone calls, when I was harangued by strangers saying, 'Why are you sitting down there writing your stories instead of out condemning your society?'
''I had been writing about that steadily right along, by letting my characters show this.
I see as my privilege writing about human beings as human beings with all the things that make them up, including bigotry, misunderstanding, injustice and also love and affection and whatever else.
Whatever else makes them up interests me.''
In the Mind of an Assassin
The story, ''Where Is the Voice Coming From?,'' was rushed into print in The New Yorker only days after Evers's killer was arrested.
Taking up only two pages, it was a chilling journey into the mind of a bigoted psychopath.
Hailed as a disturbingly effective examination of the roots of racial hatred, it has since been included in many anthologies.
She leaves no immediate survivors.
''You're doing all right,'' he said.
''The writing of a novel is taking life as it already exists,'' Miss Welty said.
''What distinguishes it above all from the raw material, and what distinguishes it from journalism, is that inherent is the possibility of a shared act of the imagination between its writer and its reader.
There is absolutely everything in great fiction but a clear answer.''
''Clearly, where monetary policy goes from here will depend crucially on the evolving situation in the economy,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
Asked whether the Fed's six interest rate cuts this year had been as potent as expected in reviving the economy, Mr. Greenspan said monetary policy interacts with the economy and the markets in complex ways that are hard to track.
''I'm not saying there is a black box, or anything of that nature, but the complexity of our economy is such, and the way liquidity flows through the system is such, that you essentially get very complex differences in the way monetary policy plays out,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
''But at the end of the day, it does seem to be effective.''

The Fed chairman said that financial markets were signaling that Argentina was making headway in bolstering its economic condition.
In any case, he said, there is now less chance than a few years ago of a problem in one developing country spreading rapidly through the global financial system, despite the slowdown in the United States.
''There are very few fixed-exchange-rate problems.
The extent to which debt was extended is much less.
The reserves are better.''
The problem in Japan, he said, is that banks, saddled with huge losses on real estate loans, have all but ceased to perform their function as financial intermediaries -- that is, lending to creditworthy enterprises to keep the economy moving.
The United States has problems, he said, ''but it is scarcely an issue of lack of liquidity or a lack of financial intermediation,'' because the banking system and the financial markets have remained healthy.
EURO GAINS.
EURO FALLS.
With his country's economy seeming to wind down by the day, Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister of Thailand, and his government are considering whether they might not hasten a return to better days by setting the country's clocks ahead.
The novel proposition, which has attracted widespread opposition within Thailand and among its neighbors, would move the country one hour earlier, from seven hours before Greenwich Mean Time to eight, the same time zone observed by Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong (as if Chicago wanted to be on New York time).
Mr. Thaksin's argument is that jumping into the next time zone would help financial markets in Bangkok operate in closer harmony with larger markets in Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, attracting more foreign investment.
He has asked several government bodies to examine the potential economic benefits of the proposal.
While foreign investors have been selling Thai stocks -- Bangkok's benchmark index has dropped more than 13 percent this year -- economists say they would be more impressed if the government tried to increase flagging exports and clean up Thailand's banks.
''The thing that the government needs to focus on right now is restructuring the nonperforming loans,'' said Thanomsri Fongarunrung, an economist at Merrill Lynch in Bangkok.
The government is moving to address these issues, though not with the kind of speedy determination investors want to see.

On Wednesday, Thailand's central bank lowered its estimated range for the nation's economic growth this year to 2 to 2.5 percent, from an earlier forecast of 2.5 to 4 percent.

Mr. Thaksin's time-zone proposal is not the first of his ideas to have raised eyebrows.
In May, he fired his central bank governor for defying a call to raise interest rates and prevent the nation's currency, the baht, from falling further.
Economists said it would squelch economic growth further.
Some economists have also questioned the economic wisdom of Mr. Thaksin's plan to hand over roughly $1.5 billion to the nation's villages and be lenient with farmers on about $1.6 billion in interest payments.
In April, Mr. Thaksin announced a discovery he said could pay off Thailand's mounting national debt: a hidden treasure left by fleeing Japanese troops in a cave after World War II.
Changing the time in Thailand would put it an hour ahead of its neighbors to the east -- Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
Thailand's official timekeeper has opposed the plan, saying it would disrupt lives unnecessarily.
There are stranger policies on time.
China's 1.2 billion people, for instance, live in a single time zone, from Manchuria to the Himalayas.
And, of course, the United States changes its time twice every year.
Whether or not Mr. Thaksin can change the country's time, the clock may be ticking for him personally.
The country's constitutional court is due to rule early next month on whether the prime minister is guilty of financial wrongdoing.
If it does, it could signal the end of Mr. Thaksin's rule.
MERCK, McDonald's and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing provide reminders of how the strong dollar is making matters worse for American investors by eating into sales and earnings.
McDonald's operating income in Asia was cut by 12 percentage points.
Looking abroad, the CAC-40 index in France is down 16 percent so far this year in euros but off 22 percent in dollars, a reminder of how Americans investing abroad have been hurt by the dollar's strength.
A strong dollar cuts into earnings by dulling a company's competitive edge overseas and through the reduction of profits earned abroad when they are translated back into dollars.
This translation is also deepening the foreign stock market losses for Americans.
All of this makes the dollar's recent slide against the euro something to note.
Since reaching a 2001 high on July 5, the dollar had fallen 4.6 percent against the euro by Friday.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Whether this is a trend is hard to tell.
The euro has rallied many times since its birth in 1999, only to fall again.
Because it has been a currency that disappoints, analysts and traders who once had positive opinions of it have since sworn off it.
But there is growing pressure from exporters in the United States and finance officials abroad for a weaker dollar.
That would help American exporters by making their products more price-competitive abroad.
It would also help some domestic sales, because foreign imports now have a price advantage.
If a weaker dollar helped the American economy rebound, it could be the engine that pulls Europe and other regions out of the doldrums.

Anne Mills, senior foreign economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, is willing to go only this far out on the forecasting limb: the average value of the dollar against the euro is likely to be lower over the next six months than it was for the last six months.
The European Central Bank could help the dollar's recent slide become a trend by cutting its benchmark interest rate this summer.
The Federal Reserve could also put downward pressure on the dollar.
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, expects a weak economy in the second half of the year to force the Fed to push its benchmark rate, now at 3.75 percent, even lower.
Such a move, he said, would weaken the dollar.
But the Bush administration's management of the strong-dollar policy it inherited from President Bill Clinton may be more important to the outlook.
The administration says it still supports a strong dollar.
This does not mean that the Bush administration would say it wants a weaker dollar.
That would probably send the dollar plunging, which would not be beneficial.
But if the dollar is taken lower by ''the markets,'' and if the administration can say the dollar is still strong when it has slipped to 1.05 euros, from 1.14 at the end of last week, there could be a change without a change.
IF the dollar does weaken, it would be quite a break.
Based on UBS Warburg forecasts, he is not confident that the dollar will weaken enough against a broad range of currencies to improve the outlook for earnings soon.
While the dollar is slipping against the euro, it is staying robust against the Japanese yen and has risen sharply against the currencies of some emerging-markets countries.
''But it's not getting better.''
In a nation where for many years military coups were the common method of changing governments and where force and money are still prime commodities in governance, it would announce the coming of a new way of doing things.

But while political analysts here say it seems clear that Mr. Thaksin did violate the rules, the public seems overwhelmingly to oppose his removal.
His two-year-old party, Thai Love Thai, something of a one-man show, stormed into Parliament in January with the first absolute majority in modern Thai politics.
Despite the case against him, Mr. Thaksin's popularity has only grown, fed by his image as a can-do manager, his nationalist rhetoric and his populist promises of debt forgiveness and cash handouts.
A poll of 1,223 residents of Bangkok, published in July, showed his approval rating still rising, to about 61 percent from 51 percent in April.
But just 4.5 percent said he should defy a ruling by the court.
Thailand abhors confrontation and it may well be that what some here call a ''Thai solution'' will be reached, a compromise that blurs the sharp edges of the issue.
According to one popular theory, the court might backdate the five-year ban to the time of the offense, when Mr. Thaksin was a government minister in 1997.
In that case he would be excluded from office for only 18 months, a period short enough to allow him to maintain control of his party and act as a power behind the scenes.
But if any such compromise is not based firmly on the Constitution, political analysts say, it could undermine the notion of equality under the law.
''They are human beings.
They know the score.
They face a really difficult call.''
Though Mr. Thaksin's removal would be unpopular and could be a political and economic setback for the country, he said, it could strengthen Thailand in the long run.

''We are trying to develop the rule of law,'' he said.
''I just happen to believe that this process is a lot more important for the long-term future of the country.''
That view is shared by many editors, academics and political analysts here, but the notion of the rule of law has not yet taken deep root beyond a relatively small elite.
What is more common is the view expressed by a movie actress, Juree Osiri, who joined other celebrities in June in a show of public support for Mr. Thaksin.
''I see this prime minister as a dedicated man who aspires to serve,'' she said after presenting him with a big bouquet.
''Why should he be interrupted and removed from office?
Why shouldn't the public give him a chance?''

Traditional Thai society is organized along lines of hierarchy and patronage by which people know their place and power is divided among cliques and fiefdoms.
It is those powerful people who stand to lose by change and they are fighting a determined house-to-house battle against the reforms.
Many Thais trace their democratic revolution to student uprisings in 1973 and 1976, as well as to mass demonstrations against a military government in 1992 that ended in widespread bloodshed.
Little by little, the sight of hundreds of farmers from the provinces demonstrating in the capital against land seizures, dam building or pipeline construction has become common.
That document now charts the battlefield for Thailand's struggle over the future.
Among other reforms, the Constitution created an electoral commission to address widespread campaign abuses and a countercorruption commission that is enforcing rules against graft.
The electoral commission has roared into life, disqualifying scores of elected parliamentary candidates for a variety of irregularities.

It is the new anti-graft commission that charged Mr. Thaksin with wrongdoing.
Mr. Thaksin appealed this ruling to the Constitutional Court, which has held hearings and is deliberating its verdict now.
Members of the court say they have come under such public pressure that some have changed their telephone numbers or taken extended sick leave.
Mr. Thaksin's strategy seems to be to overwhelm the judges with an avalanche of public sentiment.
There have been petition drives, mass prayer rallies, astrological predictions and endorsements of his position by everyone from monks to motorcycle clubs.
There are people who say Thailand will fall apart without him.
Mr. Thaksin's no-nonsense style brings excitement to many Thais who are accustomed to governments that bog down in political deals, pork-barrel projects and schemes for personal enrichment.
Indeed, one of his most popular lines of defense is that he is already so rich as a telecommunications tycoon -- the wealthiest man in Thailand -- that he has no need to enrich himself in office.
That is the paradox.
Mr. Thaksin has brought a refreshing results-oriented attitude to leadership, taking direct control of trouble-plagued ministries and cutting through bureaucratic brambles to make things happen.

But the question now does not have to do with results; it has to do with process.
Mr. Thaksin wants to make things work as a one-man manager.
The democratic reformers want the entire nation to participate.
The budget office report underscores how much may depend on the answer.
Five years of shrinking welfare rolls in New York and steady welfare allocations from Washington have meant a windfall for New York state and city budgets that totaled $6.7 billion statewide.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The spending of the windfall is controlled mainly at the state level.
But the city used about $470 million of the money last year for services that have now been built in to the budget, the analysis estimated, especially child care subsidies that grew to $368 million, from $167 million three years ago.
This puts a significant part of the city's budget at risk if an economic downturn sends more people onto public aid, the analysis said, or if Congress cuts federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families next year when it considers reauthorization of the welfare overhaul law.
Typically, those at the bottom are the most vulnerable to losing their jobs or not being hired in a downturn, he said.
But there are many imponderables, he added.
''One possibility is that a lot of people might want to come back on the rolls, and the states might not let them,'' Mr. Holzer said.
''That's not necessarily a good outcome, because they might have nowhere else to turn.''

But others have given the economy most of the credit, said Sheila Zedlewski, an analyst with the moderate Urban Institute, a social policy research organization that has reviewed many similar studies.
But in this case, she added, ''the changes in programs and in behavior have been so great and so fundamental that historical evidence may be quite unreliable.''

On the pessimistic side, the safety net provided by unemployment has shrunk sharply over the last 20 years, and most of the single mothers now working in part-time service jobs will not qualify for benefits if they are laid off, Ms. Blank said.
Like most states, New York has set aside part of the welfare windfall as a contingency fund for a rainy day.
The city agency said a more serious, long-term problem would be posed by a substantial reduction in the city's surplus because of Congressional cuts.
That, it said, could force city officials ''to make difficult choices between curtailing child care, job training, and other services, or drawing on additional city funds to maintain these and other programs.''
In the latest sign that Europe is succumbing to a global slowdown, unemployment in France, the second-biggest economy in Europe after Germany's, rose in June to 8.8 percent.
The higher unemployment rate, coupled with reports of declining factory prices in France, Italy and the Netherlands, is expected to put pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates.

In June, a small dissenting group of international economists and political scientists met to discuss this absence of a full public discourse.

The participants essentially found themselves up against a wall.
Nations have little leeway to adopt policies that deviate from those accepted by institutions like the International Monetary Fund or those demanded by the financial markets.
If they do, capital flees, interest rates rise and loans are not renewed.
But the truly regrettable paradox is that the strategies advocated by the economic and financial mainstream -- reduced government spending, privatization, unrestricted capital flows and completely free trade -- are not the policies that gave rise to the rapid growth of developing nations in the recent past.
Had South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand or Brazil been restricted to the policies considered acceptable today, they would not have been such success stories.
As Mr. Rodrik points out, Taiwan and South Korea adopted aggressive industrial policies to subsidize crucial industries.
Most slowly depreciated their currencies, rather than adopt the floating currencies advocated today (or the fixed-currency regime used by Argentina).
Moreover, not only are successful policies often abandoned, but as the current plight of Argentina and New Zealand suggests, liberalizing policies often fail, too.
Robert Wade, a political scientist at the London School of Economics, argues that few nations that were largely dependent on commodity exports, like New Zealand, have been able to transform themselves into successful producers of advanced goods based on such policies.

For Mr. Wade, such a transformation still requires an industrial policy.
At times, to take one example, it may require an import-substitution policy of high tariffs to protect developing domestic industries.
Mr. Wade counters that it was the indebtedness of many Latin American nations that created crises and poor growth in the 1980's, not import substitution, and that the establishment has essentially twisted the argument in its favor.
Neither Mr. Wade nor Mr. Rodrik, whose most recent book is ''The New Global Economy and Developing Countries: Making Openness Work'' (Overseas Development Council, 1999), says he thinks there is one policy to fit all sizes.
Import substitution may be appropriate to some, but not others.
Both argue strongly that local conditions should be allowed to determine the right course, not international institutions with universal formulas.
To Mr. Unger, however, the author of ''Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative'' (Verso Books, 1998), only more sweeping change has a chance to work.
Mr. Unger proposes not so much a blueprint but a profoundly new direction that includes high levels of government investment and taxes, required voting and forced savings to buffer states from the influence of international investors.
Mr. Unger says his ideas have certainly not caught on among the establishment, but he is attracting a lot of interest from the younger generation.
Given the levels of poverty, this is no surprise.
Yet the protesters in Genoa and elsewhere also naïvely denigrate the value of economic growth.
Mr. Wade, for example, points out that there is no evidence that local participation in devising economic strategies, so widely advocated by protesting groups, will provide an answer to alleviating poverty unless it is accompanied by other pro-growth strategies.
What is surely the case, however, is that if nations remain under the thumb of single-minded international investors and their institutional surrogates, there will be little room for new ideas.
Mr. Rodrik says the financial turmoil in Turkey, for example, has been made worse by the immediate demands by institutions for liberalization.
Mr. Wade says serious industrial policy is hard to undertake in current circumstances.

To mitigate the power of the financial markets requires leadership from the powerful themselves.
But such leadership is absent not only in Washington and most other Western capitals but also in America's major academic centers.
Economists pointed to rising unemployment and deteriorating business confidence in Western Europe and North America as important factors in the bank's decision.
In Germany, the largest economy in Europe, executives are more pessimistic than at any time in five years.
Worrisome statistics released in the United States recently included slowing orders for durable goods, less robust economic growth and an uptick in unemployment.

''The Bank of England is worried about the effects of the global slowdown on the U.K. economy, and they are willing to fight that by boosting domestic demand'' through looser monetary policy, said Michael Taylor, a Merrill Lynch economist.
Analysts still expect Britain's economy to grow 2.2 percent in 2001, faster than either the United States or the big economies of Europe.
Inflation in Britain has remained below the bank's target of 2.5 percent for more than two years, leaving room to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy.
While the inflation rate has crept higher lately, reaching 2.4 percent in the 12 months through June, the bank attributed the rise to ''erratic factors,'' like food prices and said that ''underlying price and cost pressures are expected to remain subdued.''
The European Central Bank has had less maneuvering room, because inflation in its bailiwick has been running above its target for more than a year.
But price rises have slowed somewhat in recent months, leading many analysts to predict a rate cut in August.

The move by the Bank of England today was especially surprising given past statements by bank leaders like Mervyn King, the deputy governor, who has championed predictability as the best recipe for stable markets.
Mr. King has also expressed concern about what he deems an ''unsustainable imbalance'' in Britain's economy -- domestic demand, as signified by retail spending and house prices remaining robust while export-driven industries like manufacturing falter.
Exports now account for one-quarter of Britain's total output of goods and services.
''If the Bank of England is trying to stoke the domestic economy by throwing fuel on the fire, it might get out of hand later this year, especially if the global economy improves,'' said Peter Dixon, a Commerzbank Securities economist.
Spending by British consumers, equal to about two-thirds of gross domestic product, has been buoyant lately.
Major store chains have been reporting robust gains: an 8.6 percent rise in sales at Carpetright, Britain's largest carpet retailer, in the three months ended July 31; a 19 percent jump at Hamleys, the toy store, in the 16 weeks to July 20; a 5.6 percent rise at J. Sainsbury, the No.
2 supermarket chain, in the 12 weeks to June 23.

The Confederation of British Industry had been lobbying for a rate cut, and Douglas Godden, the group's head of economic policy, praised the move today.
''Interest rates are now at the appropriate level,'' he said.
But homebuyers will see some benefit almost immediately.
Three major mortgage lenders -- Halifax, Lloyds TSB and the Nationwide Building Society -- quickly followed the Bank of England's move with quarter-point reductions in their rates, making mortgage money cheaper here than at any time since 1963.
Based on yesterday's employment figures, there was a growing consensus among analysts that the Fed's policy makers were unlikely to cut interest rates more than a quarter of a percentage point when they meet on Aug. 21 and that this might be the last rate cut for a while.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was also unchanged at 5.16 percent.
A further sign emerged that corporate profits might not improve any time soon.
Thomson Financial/First Call, a research firm, said analysts were now expecting earnings to be flat in the fourth quarter instead of turning around.
''Chips are giving back their gains, and we have the Friday factor at work, which means reasonably light volume,'' said Alan Ackerman, chief market strategist at Fahnestock & Company.
''We have a market that's still within a tight trading range and no indication that it's likely to break out of that range in the immediate term.''

Noven Pharmaceuticals, a maker of drug delivery products, tumbled $14.34, to $18.98, after warning that its earnings this year would fall short of expectations because of a drop in orders.
Despite yesterday's somewhat disappointing economic data -- the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its nonmanufacturing index fell to 48.9 in July from 52.1 in June -- investors appear to be having more muted reactions to such news.
''Industries and companies are starting to talk about having the worst behind them in their business; and maybe the pickup in orders isn't quite there yet, but there's a growing chorus of, 'Yeah, we think the worst is behind us,' '' said Joseph Battipaglia, the chairman of investment policy at Gruntal & Company.
''The statistics that bear out the weakness don't have the same impact that they did 12 months ago,'' he added.
Gov.
Ronnie Musgrove of Mississippi, a Democrat, is not up for re-election until 2003.
But the rumor mill is already grinding hard on the matter of a big-name challenger.
One line of speculation holds that a native son, Haley Barbour, a Washington lobbyist par excellence and a former Republican national chairman, is gearing up to head home to take on Mr. Musgrove.
A tough job, but what better way to get out and about?
Or so the mill grinds.
Then there is the Trent Lott rumor, which goes something like this:
Senate Republicans are pretty well fed up with Mr. Lott as their leader, whether they are in the majority or in the minority.
So pretty soon they will find a new leader.
Whereupon Mr. Lott will revert to being the lowly junior senator from Mississippi, because Thad Cochran, a fellow Republican, has served longer -- whereupon Mr. Lott will head home to run for governor.
Far-fetched?
Maybe.
But as Bill Minor, the dean of Mississippi political reporters, pointed out the other day in The Biloxi Sun Herald, noting that Mr. Lott is not up for re-election until 2006, ''Lott could run for governor without giving up his Senate seat.''
No comment from Mr. Barbour.
Or Mr. Lott.
Mr. Barak tried to finesse that with his proposal for annexing 80 percent of the settlers.
Mr. Arafat, fearing assassination, wouldn't even go that far.
He showed himself at Camp David, and after, as a man who would rather get nothing for his people than look them in the eye and say, ''We're going to get some things and not others.''
That is, they were a more generous series of trade offs designed to overcome all the problems that had stalled the 1998 Good Friday peace deal -- including proposals that the I.R.A.
finally disarm in exchange for deeper cuts in British troops and more reforms to the pro-Protestant police.
Like Camp David, these tradeoffs were aimed at shrinking the number of hard-liners who would oppose a deal, so the inevitable civil wars within the I.R.A.
and unionist camps, with the last rejectionists, could be as small as possible.

The I.R.A.
set off a bomb in London last week, signaling what could be the start of their civil war within.
If there is a reason to be more optimistic about Northern Ireland than the Middle East, it's because of the surrounding states.
The European Union has pumped millions of dollars of investment and infrastructure into Ireland, creating jobs, prosperity and a wider political identity for young people to link up with -- which has produced solid Catholic and Protestant majorities for peace.
In the Middle East, by contrast, the hinterland has fueled the conflict.
Because virtually all the Arab leaders are illegitimate, none of them have the self-confidence to tell Mr. Arafat to compromise or give him cover.
Clearly, both these conflicts need outside pressure to make progress -- because the parties find imposing civil wars on themselves too difficult.
Why?
Because the extremist minorities in all these parties have a strong emotional hold over the moderate majorities, and to kill your own you have to believe strongly in peace with the other guy -- which is not fully there in Northern Ireland or the Mideast.
In the Middle East, though, no outside power -- for now -- cares enough to pay the domestic political costs of imposing a deal.
FISH oil in ice cream.
Flaxseed in cheese.
Sound tempting?
Fish and flax are rich in omega-3's, the polyunsaturated fatty acids that research indicates may reduce the risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disorders and may also have anticancer properties.
Despite all these sterling qualities, Americans don't eat enough of the nutritious foods that contain omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, tuna, nuts, avocado, canola oil and wild game.
So food technologists are busy putting omega-3's into foods Americans will eat, like ice cream.
Working to make bad diets good, technologists in the last few years have been creating nutraceuticals, adding nutrients to foods that have either insignificant levels of them or none.
They've added echinacea to tea, St. John's wort to fruit drinks, calcium to orange juice, omega-3's to eggs.
Coming soon to your supermarket: omega-3's in ice cream, cheese, bread, yogurt and cream cheese.
But those attracted to nutraceuticals have to consider whether the benefits are offset by the consumption of large amounts of calories, fat and cholesterol in many of these products.
''We baby boomers want to live forever, and we want to eat food products that will be beneficial and will enhance our health.''
Dr. Rudolph, who works for Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., is getting the omega-3's from fish oil.
''We chose ice cream because it is distributed frozen,'' which he said helps mask the taste of fish oils.
What he has created is an achingly sweet reduced-fat creamsicle with 150 calories, 6 grams of fat and 150 milligrams of omega-3's in a 3 1/2-ounce serving.

Although experts think that 1 to 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids a day might be useful, there is no standard yet for how much should be added to foods.
Nor is it known whether they are absorbed best when eaten with the nutrients that accompany them naturally in foods like fish, avocado and nuts.
''It's not good to put in 100 percent of a supplement,'' Dr. Rudolph said, ''because you don't want people to overdose.''

Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the nutrition and food studies program at New York University, agrees completely but had trouble imagining Dr. Rudolph's creation.
''Ice cream?
It's health food,'' she said, ''I think they should genetically engineer cows to make omega-3 fats.''
On a more serious note, ''the single-nutrient approach to nutrition unbalances the diet,'' she said, recommending that those who want added nutrients take them in a daily vitamin and mineral supplement.
''I'm starting to see papers that women are beginning to exceed the upper limit for calcium because so much calcium has been added to food,'' she said.
''Too much calcium messes up the metabolism and interferes with iron absorption.''
No one knows how much omega-3 is too much or what effects it might have.
Omega-3's are already added to eggs, and I tried two brands.
Gold Circle Farms eggs have 150 milligrams each.
Pete and Gerry's eggs have 200.
The eggs are bland.
Better than fishy.
Omega Rich cheese, made by Nutrasur in Ontario, is available in Canada.
An ounce of it, so mild that children will eat it, contains 112 milligrams of omega-3's.
The cows are fed a supplement containing flax and fish meal.
The milk is high in omega-3 but has a fishy smell, said James Stewart, vice president of marketing and sales of Omega Rich.
The company also sells a bread made with flax.
Two slices of the bread contain 1,728 milligrams of omega-3's.
Is it only a matter of time before omega-3's find their way into Twinkies, or maybe even into the oil used for cooking french fries, turning everything Americans love into health food?
People who don't want to eat even a very small portion of fresh salmon, which has 1,800 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids in a 3 1/2-ounce serving, or bluefin tuna, which has 1,600 milligrams, may want to think about what Mindy Herman, a registered dietitian in Mount Kisco, N.Y., has to say: ''The biggest harm is in deceiving yourself into thinking that if you eat foods with certain additives in them, your diet is automatically healthy.
Don't fool yourself into believing that omega-3 cheese is going to solve all your nutrition issues.''

In the meantime, much of the rest of Europe grappled with high unemployment and sluggish growth.
So now, the Netherlands and some other economies present a quandary for the two-and-a-half-year-old European Central Bank, which sets a single monetary policy for fast-growing nations and struggling ones alike.
From its headquarters in Frankfurt, the bank dispenses the same medicine for eastern Germany where the unemployment rate still exceeds 10 percent, as for the Netherlands where, even in the current slowdown, joblessness is running at 2 percent.
Dutch inflation is the highest in Western Europe at 5 percent; in France it is barely over 2 percent.
Torn between signs in Germany, the Continent's largest economy, of a severe slowdown that risks a stumble into recession and degrees of inflation in the Netherlands, Ireland and Portugal, the European central bankers are having trouble arriving at a one-size-fits-all monetary policy.
So far, they have cut interest rates slightly, to 4.5 percent.
By now, if they still had control of their own monetary policy, they might well have tried to slow their economic growth by raising interest rates.
But lacking control over rates, the Netherlands is suffering both from the global economic slowdown and a measure of inflationary pressure that ties in with its shortage of workers.
The labor squeeze exists in almost every category.
Even as the economy begins to weaken in response to the global slowdown, the scarcity of workers has become something of a preoccupation.
Construction companies have had to turn down projects.
Schools are so short of teachers that the government has reduced certification requirements.
Some educators have debated the merits of a four-day school week to allow the existing pool of teachers to serve more children.
Hospitals are severely short of nurses, and several have tried, so far with little success, to import some from South Africa.
Language and culture are barriers.
''When you move someone from New York to Illinois, it is not so hard because at least you have the same language,'' said Hans de Boer, president of the Royal Association of Small and Medium-Size Enterprises.
''But when you want to hire someone here from Germany or France, it's entirely different.
As soon as the job gets into communications, the fact that we all speak different languages is a problem.''
In recent months, the Netherlands has been sharply affected by the economic slowdown in the United States.
Dutch growth, heavily dependent on exports, virtually halted in the first quarter of this year and remains anemic.
But so far, that has not eased the labor shortage.
Temporary-employment agencies are trolling for construction workers in Germany, offering free housing and transportation.

It probably will not be enough.
In a recent report, the Dutch government warned that staff shortages and rising wages were eroding the ability to compete for business.
''Labor costs will increase considerably more than among the Netherlands' European competitors,'' the report said.
Citing ''bottlenecks owing to staff shortages'' and ''deteriorating competitiveness,'' the report predicted that ''Dutch exporters will lose market share to international competitors in 2001 and 2002.''
Almost everywhere, the job shortage is apparent.
''We've been looking for four months for two people skilled in custom-tailored suits,'' said Wymcko Tonckens, manager of the Society Shop.
''We hired one person who starts in August, but we haven't hired the other.''
To find workers, some companies have been willing to go to considerable lengths.

The company searches high schools for students as young as 15 who can be trained to dig trenches and lay cable.
''We need 60 people right now, ordinary laborers,'' said Helma Evers, Nettenbouw's human resources director.
''We have had to turn down requests from companies and municipal authorities.''
Timberland, the American producer of hiking boots and outdoor clothing, has built a huge warehouse and shipping center in Enschede, an eastern city.
Gradually, Timberland has shut down warehouses scattered across Europe and consolidated its operations in Enschede.
But about half its workers come from other countries like Germany, Poland and Finland.
All the top managers can speak German, and one of the Polish workers speaks Dutch and acts as interpreter for compatriots.

''We could not do it just with Dutch workers -- it would be impossible,'' said Harry Klijnstra, Timberland's human resources manager.
The scarcity of workers is making Dutch officials grapple with immigration issues unresolved for decades.
The Netherlands already has nearly two million immigrants, many of whom came in the 1960's as guest workers from Turkey, or from former Dutch colonies, in search of economic opportunity.
Now, under pressure from the government, Dutch companies have started training programs and found jobs for more than 20,000 ''allochtonen,'' immigrants who came as guest workers or are the children of guest workers.
The TNT Post Group, which owns the postal service, recently began training about 150 foreigners to become letter carriers.
One was Viviane Thiese wa Thiese, a 19-year-old political refugee from Congo who has been in Rotterdam for three years and has never had a job.
Ms. Thiese wa Thiese, whose first language is French, still struggles with Dutch.
Part of her training is in language skills.
The rest covers such matters as how to carry the mail on a bicycle and how to sort the mail by streets.
In another effort to ease job scarcity, the Dutch have changed laws to attract more stay-at-home wives into the labor market.
''To sustain our level of economic growth, there are two possibilities,'' said Jochem P. Hanse, head of the government's Commission of Foreign Investment.
''We either have to increase labor productivity or increase the labor participation rate.''
With wages rising and labor productivity declining, the Dutch cost advantage is shrinking.
Employers are pushing the government and the unions to make major changes in the country's safety net.
Almost a million people collect disability paychecks of as much as 70 percent of their last salary.
About 950,000 people, almost 10 percent of the adult population, are listed as at least partly disabled.
Company executives are pushing hard to scale back the program.
''I am quite sure there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of well-skilled workers who could be helping us out,'' Mr. Kleiwegt of Croon Elektrotechniek said.

At Croon, executives have tried almost everything.
So far, the program has attracted 70 applications, not nearly enough to meet the demand.
THE business is declining, with new competitors and technological trends that could eventually destroy the industry.
Many companies have better growth prospects.
But even with all those problems, you might think that a 21 percent dividend would entice investors.
That amazing yield is available now on a new security that carries a household name: MCI.
The number is that high because Wall Street is bored with a simple thing like yield and because there are doubts that the company can continue to pay the dividend forever.
But you don't need forever to make money with income that high.
MCI's new stock is a tracking stock issued by WorldCom, which merged with MCI a few years back.
The stock is supposed to track the performance of MCI's business, largely consumer and small-business long-distance service, and it sports a $2.40 annual dividend.
Now, with the stock down to $11.18, the yield is 21.5 percent.
The idea was that WorldCom stock, freed of the stodgy, old long-distance business, would appeal to growth investors, while the new MCI would attract those interested in high dividends.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
So far, the idea has not worked very well.
Since the spinoff, WorldCom is down 28 percent and MCI is off 38 percent.
Some question whether MCI can keep paying the dividend.
The Baby Bells are getting into long distance and revenues are falling.
Virtually no one seems to like MCI.
Is the dividend safe?
Yes, says Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's chief executive.
''Investors should be confident of our ability to service debt and pay the $2.40 dividend for the foreseeable future,'' he said last month.

Of course, the board can cancel the dividend when it wants to.
But there is a good reason the dividend is probably safe: Mr. Ebbers needs the money, and the board seems determined to do what it can for him.
But he seems to have lived a bit too well, borrowing money against his stock when it was riding high.
He now owns WorldCom and MCI stock worth $238 million, which sounds like plenty.
But he owes more than $268 million on loans secured by that stock.
In other words, he is in the hole for about $30 million.
Of that debt, $183.7 million is owed to Bank of America, and would become due immediately if Mr. Ebbers left WorldCom.
The rest is owed to WorldCom, which charges him just 5.3 percent interest.
(In contrast, WorldCom apparently figures that MCI's credit is not as good.
In balancing the internal company accounts, WorldCom assesses MCI an interest rate of 8.4 percent.)
Mr. Ebbers, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will receive $1.7 million a year in dividends on his MCI stock.
It seems like a reasonable bet that he and his board will do their best to keep the cash flowing.
It is not just the board's willingness to extend low-interest loans that shows how beloved Mr. Ebbers is to it.
Since Mr. Ebbers cannot afford to quit -- at least not until the stock rises sharply -- one could conclude the board was just being nice to an old friend in need.
Some of this price restraint has come from the decline this year in overall commodity prices, which are down 12 percent.
The CRB/Bridge index of raw industrial prices, which is seen as a barometer of manufacturing demand, fell on Tuesday to 238.28, its lowest point since October 1986, and bounced up only a few tenths of a point by the end of the week.
The current level of the index, which includes prices for copper, lead, steel, tin, zinc, rubber and cotton, puts it more than 20 points below the 260 level it reached after the end of the last recession in 1991.

James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan, said the fall in commodity prices ''is reflecting, I think, the global industrial recession.''
Yields of long-term interest rates have also declined recently, with the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note falling to 4.98 percent, from 5.03 percent on Thursday and from 5.52 percent in May, its high for the year.
''I think there is still some denial out there about how long this will go on,'' Maureen Allyn, chief economist at Zurich Scudder Investments, said of the current economic slowdown.

She also said that despite the six interest rate cuts by the Fed since Jan. 3, ''we really shouldn't expect Fed policy to have any traction until the first quarter of next year.''
Mr. Glassman of J. P. Morgan said, ''There is a feeling in the markets that what is going on around us is getting worse.''
He said the next eight weeks would be critical for the economic outlook because some sign of a bounce is awaited from the spending that is expected to be inspired by the $38 billion in tax rebates now on their way to American taxpayers.
''If in the next eight weeks we just get more of the same economic news, then we are in a worse slowdown than people thought,'' he said.
He is expecting a quarter point cut in the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks -- the Fed's interest rate benchmark -- this month and another later in the year.
Ms. Allyn still thinks that a quarter point this month will be the last rate reduction for a while.
This is because she expects tax rebates to perk up consumer spending.
''I think they will come through pretty nicely,'' she said of the tax rebates.
The July decline in overall producer prices for finished goods was the sharpest since August 1993, led by a 5.8 percent drop in energy, including a 17.7 percent decline in prices for gasoline.
Melinda Ballard's house has become an emblem of the mold invasion.
There is as much mold here as anyone has ever seen.
The place is Exhibit A for lawyers, a how-not-to guide for homeowners, a business handbook for contractors and an ongoing nightmare for insurers.
As we walk in through an unlocked side door (''Who would be stupid enough to come in and steal anything?''
Ballard says) this dream home certainly looks like a nightmare: the House That Mold Ate.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Armies of inspectors have been through this house in the more than two years since Ballard, her husband, Ron Allison, and their son, Reese, now 5, left.
It is thick and black and gangrenous, with a dull, powdery sheen that makes it seem waiting and alive.
Just looking at it makes you want to throw up.
As a result, the house feels like a mad scientist's lab, with plastic bags of mold wherever you turn -- near the sweeping Tara staircase in the front hall, interrupting the hand-painted murals on the walls, next to a portrait of Ballard in regal jewels and finery, behind the Erector set in Reese's bedroom.
We stay for less than 10 minutes, but it is long enough.
As we pull back down the endless driveway, my mouth feels dry, my throat aches and I am dizzy.
Or maybe it's all in my head.
Moldy homes have been around since biblical times.
Mold may even explain many of the plagues, if you accept that the crops had to be brought in early to escape the hail and locusts, meaning wet grain was stored in stacks when the darkness came, creating perfect breeding grounds for mold.
The pampered firstborn sons may have eaten the top layer, and the toxins in the moldy grain could have killed them.
In Leviticus 14:33-45, the Lord tells Moses and Aaron how to rid a house of mold.
First ask a priest to inspect it.
Then scrape the inside walls and throw all contaminated materials in an unclean part of town.
If that doesn't work, the house ''must be torn down -- its stones, timbers and all the plaster.''
''That's exactly what we do today, except we skip the priest part,'' says David C. Straus, who, as a professor of microbiology and immunology at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, is a 21st-century version of a mold priest.
The molds that Straus and others try to exorcise are everywhere.
There are thousands of varieties, found in every region of the country, including the wildly different climates of Alaska and Hawaii.
Virtually every breath you take contains mold spores, and although some people are more allergic than others, for most of us this is not a problem.
Indoors, the drama begins when the spores encounter steady and significant amounts of water, commonly in the form of a roof leak or an unnoticed burst in a pipe.
Add a cellulose-based material -- the wallboards that modern homes are made of and older homes are renovated with turn out to be the perfect snack for multiplying mold -- and things get worse.
''These organisms go, 'Aha, I'm going to grow from a few spores on the surface to a colony that can be seen by the naked eye, containing hundreds of thousands or even millions of spores,' '' says Linda D. Stetzenbach, director of the microbiology division of the Harry Reid Center for Environmental Studies at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas.
This in and of itself is not necessarily a problem, either.
Most molds, even multiplying ones, are relatively harmless, and most people won't have a strong reaction to them (unless they're allergic).
But there is mold, and there is mold.
Exposure to certain types of fungi, known as toxic mold, can cause a serious reaction.
If you're unlucky, this is the kind of mold you have.
If you're really unlucky, your toxic mold will gird for battle and go to war, secreting chemicals called mycotoxins, which can find their way into your body, entering through your nose, mouth and skin, lodging perhaps in your digestive tract, your lungs or your brain.
Among these toxins are trichothecenes, which were rumored to have been used as a biological weapon during the wars in Afghanistan and Vietnam.
They turned out not to be very useful as weapons, however, because they poison slowly and erratically.
Nor is she comforted by the fact that these molds are not really attacking humans.
We simply get in their way.
Their real targets are plants and other fungi that compete with them for water and food.
''They're just doing what nature programmed them to do,'' says Stetzenbach, sympathizing with the mold she studies.
''If they can keep other organisms from inhabiting their space, then they get all the nutrients.''

Within a few years mold was his specialty.
But then, as now, he could find no irrefutable medical data to confirm his belief.
One founding partner was a former school administrator, so the group began working on mold-infested schools, and has evaluated or cleaned out (the term of art is ''remediated'') more than 1,000 in the past six years.
On April 1, 1999, Holder was flying to a meeting there.
The front rows of seats faced each other on Southwest Airlines, and a thin, no-nonsense businesswoman sat across from him, on her way to Arkansas for a meeting of her own.
They got to talking during the flight, and the woman complained about the parade of contractors and inspectors marching in and out of her house.
''You're talking to Noah about the flood,'' she told Holder, because that's the way she talks.
She also swears as easily as she speaks, has no patience for anyone who doesn't work as hard as she does, will insult you to your face if she thinks you're trying to ''bamboozle'' her and was warned by one lawyer before her mold lawsuit went before the jury that she had to practice being a ''dutiful Southern belle'' because men on the jury ''would be thinking, God, I would hate to be married to her.''
Fancying herself a cowgirl, she bought two cows named Jethro and Ellie Mae and lived with them and a herd of deer on 73 acres.
She and the company exchanged a number of letters on the subject of the floor, and one of those, to Theresa McConnell, a claims representative, read: ''Molds and mildew are trapped underneath the floor and will escape into the house once the foundation is exposed.
I would like for every effort to be made to ensure that the molds/mildew do not ruin furniture, carpets, etc.''
Ballard then accused Farmers of stalling because it did not want to reimburse the whole of such an expensive claim, an allegation the company denies.
Melinda began having dizzy spells.
He would forget simple things like where he'd left his credit card or where he'd parked his car, or even what kind of car he owned.
His co-workers would find him at his desk looking as if he were in a trance.
''I think I might know what's causing your problems,'' she remembers him saying, then he offered to provide her with a list of home contractors who might help.

Ballard did not want anyone else's name.
''You're remediating the governor's mansion; that's a house,'' she told Holder by phone a few days later.
''I looked in a few places I've learned to look,'' he says -- under an undisturbed board in the dining room, inside a crawl space beneath the stairs -- and found more pockets of mold.
''Walking into that house was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made,'' he says.
''None of us were wearing any protection.
Straus spent the next four hours lying in Holder's truck, crawling out only to vomit.
He also lost 25 percent of the hearing in one ear, and the damage seems to be permanent.
''I don't go into Stachy houses anymore,'' he says, theorizing that his repeated exposure over the years has left him highly sensitive to toxic mold.
''I let the young people do that.''
Taking Holder's advice to, she says, ''get the hell out of there,'' the family abandoned their home and its contents within the hour.
Stopping at a nearby Wal-Mart, they bought new clothes and toiletries, then settled in for several months at the Four Seasons Hotel.
''I credit Cutty Sark with my escaping personal injury,'' says Ballard, who refuses to wear a seat belt and hooks it over her shoulder when she drives in order to fool the cops.
Ballard jokes that ''her drinking kept her from getting as sick as the rest of the family.''
Holder says that with the current lack of scientific evidence, this is as good a theory as any, adding, ''I believe she's just too damn mean for those toxins to affect her.''
Standing outside unit 130 in the Spectrum condominium complex in Santa Ana, Calif., Alexander Robertson IV, the state's busiest mold lawyer, hands me a disposable respirator mask.
I've had practice at this by now, and I slip it on and pull the elastic tight.
Robertson is quite a sight in his own mask -- a towering man, with a shaved head and walrus mustache.
The western boots peering out from under his well-cut suits are a hint that he would rather be roping and riding.
Waiting for us in the tiny two-bedroom apartment are his client Noe Montoya, Montoya's wife and newborn baby and his two elementary-school-age daughters.
All but the infant have been sick for months, with nosebleeds and coughs, and there is black mold growing up the girls' bedroom wall.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
There are 1,500 residents of this complex, nearly all Hispanic, and all thought they had bought into the American homeowner's dream.
Montoya, who works as a waiter at a nearby chain restaurant, struggled to pay $75,000 for his condo two years ago.
Montoya cleans the mold from his daughters' hot-pink wall every morning, but it is back within a day, growing through the Sheetrock from the other side.
Unlike Melinda Ballard, who had the resources to eventually escape to a five-star hotel, Montoya is trapped.
Everything he owns is invested in this apartment.
He can't afford to rent another place, and he cannot sell.
Who would buy a condo full of mold?
Robertson is keenly aware of how he looks, standing there wearing a mask, while the family stands barefaced and unprotected.
''It's a real dilemma,'' he says.
''But I go into these buildings for a living, and I decided that I need to protect my own health.''
We walk from one apartment to the next, and Robertson points out mold wherever we go.
Pulling aside bathroom tiles and peering behind stationary concrete planters, he says things like ''There's water leaking through the joists in the drywall'' and ''We have a series of pinhole leaks in the potable water lines,'' which make him sound like the building contractor he was before he went to law school.
Then, as now, there was no definitive epidemiological study proving that mold makes people sick.
Employees began falling ill at work with symptoms ranging from rashes to extreme fatigue to memory loss, and they came to see Dr. Eckardt Johanning, an occupational and environmental doctor at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
At that time, ''occ-docs'' like Johanning specialized in other dangers of the workplace, like carpal tunnel syndrome and asbestos poisoning.
(Since then he has compiled a 675-page tome called ''Bioaerosols, Fungi and Mycotoxins: Health Effects, Assessment, Prevention and Control.'')
There were allegations that toxic mold has been used in warfare and descriptions of animal poisonings, where mycotoxins in feed went on to kill large numbers of cattle in Russia and Finland.
''We know from laboratory animals,'' explains Stetzenbach, ''when there's forced inhalation of Stachy into mice, and then the mice are sacrificed and we look at the lung tissue, we see damage.
But we can't force humans to inhale toxins.''
In the fall of 1994, Dr. Dorr Dearborn, a pediatric pulmonologist at Cleveland's Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, began seeing too many cases of babies with bleeding in their lungs.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
These conclusions caused some government agencies to take action.
The health and housing departments of Cleveland and Cayahoga County offers free home inspections to new mothers living in the part of town where the initial cases were clustered.
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has put resources into mold research, too, spending $3.17 million on an effort to remove mold from the homes of infants at risk for A.I.P.H.
and of asthmatic children.
In addition, the American Academy of Pediatrics has warned that ''until more is known about the etiology of idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage, prudence dictates that pediatricians try to ensure that infants under 1 year of age are not exposed to chronically moldy, water-damaged environments.''
Since the Cleveland study was first released, other doctors have become convinced that there are mold risks to adults as well.
''We do know for a fact that mold is associated with cognitive impairment in some people,'' says Dr. Wayne Gordon, a neuropsychologist and professor of rehabilitation medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, and one of a small but growing group of scientists who have come to specialize in the health effects of mycotoxins.
These doctors cannot yet say definitively how these toxins work and why they affect some people more than others.
But they do know that victims of the toxins visit their offices every day, more this year than last year and that their problems range from minor memory loss to devastating cognitive failure.
''This is real,'' he says, ''and it isn't going away.''
In March of last year, however, the C.D.C.
backed away from its initial study.
''The available evidence,'' the reviewers concluded, ''does not substantiate the reported epidemiologic associations -- between household water damage and A.I.P.H.
or between household fungi and A.I.P.H.
-- or any inferences regarding causality.''
In other words, one report by the C.D.C.
recants another report by the C.D.C.
The agency now describes mold as an ''allergen'' on its Web site, but makes little mention of the serious problems that researchers like Dearborn, Etzel and Gordon say are associated with mold.
Nor does it mention that their findings have been replicated by other scientists.
And while the agency advises that mold be cleaned up, it does not recommend testing to discover what type of mold is growing.
''We are not saying there are no health consequences to mold,'' says Dr. Stephen Redd, chief of the air-pollution-and-respiratory-health branch at the C.D.C.
''There's a diversity of opinion.
Our opinion is that not enough is known about it.''
The agency does not doubt that people are suffering, he says, but the C.D.C.
is lacking scientific proof of the extent to which mold is the cause.
To declare causation without that proof, he says, would be as irresponsible as waiting too long.
Dearborn and Etzel disagree and stand by their study.
The C.D.C.
''They didn't take the prudent health position that until there is definitive evidence, we will take precautions.
A legal standard of proof is 51 percent.
A scientific standard of proof is greater than 95 percent.
But where does public health prudence fall between the two?''

While scientists argue over mold, lawyers have been having a field day.
Like the fungus itself, mold litigation has completely taken over Robertson's practice in the years since the Malibu claim.
Today, callers to his voice mail are instructed that all new toxic-mold cases are being screened by the firm's new director of microbiological investigations, a paralegal with a master's degree in microbiology.
At last count, she had a list of 325 potential new clients on deck, and Robertson has stopped representing individual homeowners in favor of cases that ''really prove a point.''
On his plate at the moment are five courthouses where everyone from the judges to the bailiffs complain that they have become sick, and housing projects like the Spectrum, which, he says ''should have been the American dream, but has become a nightmare.''
(Robertson, too, makes some exceptions to his ''no private homes'' rule.
His star client right now is Erin Brockovich, whose two-story, 4,000-square-foot house outside Los Angeles -- bought with the money from the movie about her environmental crusades -- is contaminated with mold.
There is a huge poster in Robertson's office of Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich, signed by the real Erin.
''To Alex, What a 'bulldog' you are,'' it says, then asks, ''Gee, could a 'mold' movie be next?'')
Robertson says he believes he is in on the start of an entirely new area of law.
''It's a hybrid,'' he says, ''that's why people have a hard time getting their arms around it.
It's part construction defect, because that's what allows the water to get into the building.
And it's part personal injury, and very few lawyers do both.''

Industry watchers agree.
Mealey's Publications, which puts out monthly legal reports, just added Mealey's Litigation Report: Mold to its title list.
''Mold litigation isn't going to go away any time soon,'' says Colleen McLaughlin, the report's editor.
''The attorneys involved are cutting edge, the type who are always looking for the next big thing.''
What looks like Genesis to lawyers looks like Armageddon to insurance companies.
''This mold problem seemed to come out of nowhere,'' says Janet Bachman, vice-president of claims administration for the American Insurance Association.
In the state, Bachman says, there has been a 137 percent increase so far this year in the amount paid out by insurance companies for water damage.
(Insurance policies do not cover mold, per se; they cover damage that results from an otherwise covered event, like a leak or burst pipe.)
If that trend continues through the end of 2001, Texas insurers will be spending roughly $670 million on water claims.
(That does not count damage from the Houston floods last June; while they will cause mold damage, the floods themselves are not covered events, meaning the resulting damage is not reimbursed by insurance.)
Some in the insurance industry say that premiums will have to increase by 40 percent in order to offset mold claims.
Insurers are hoping, Bachman says, that this will turn out to be a short-term scare, a crisis of the moment, and that soon a fickle public will start worrying about something else.
''For a while the hysteria was over radon,'' she says.
''And now it's so obvious that nobody gives a damn.
Remember the Alar scare?
Now that's a big shrug, too.
Maybe this is just 15 minutes of fame for the latest boo-boo.''
Just in case it doesn't disappear, however, some insurers are taking concrete steps.
Farmers Insurance, for instance, has said that it will stop selling new homeowner's policies that include water-damage coverage.
In addition, it has asked the Texas Department of Insurance to allow the company to exclude mold damage from its policies entirely, even mold that results from a covered event.
State governments, in an effort to protect homeowners, are beginning to act, too.
California's Senate recently approved the Toxic Mold Protection Act, which orders the State Department of Health Services to establish licensing standards for professionals who go into the business of measuring and cleaning out toxic mold.
''Right now anyone can advertise in the Yellow Pages and call themselves a mold expert,'' says Robertson, who helped draft the legislation, and who refers to opportunists as ''mold diggers.''
Whenever Robertson gives a lecture before an industry group, he says, ''I ask for a hand count at the beginning to find out who's in the audience, and 90 percent are contractors who were all doing lead and asbestos abatement until the last year, and now they're trying to jump on the mold bandwagon.
It frightens me because you've got people that are taking a two-day course, and then they're turning around as quote-unquote experts.''
The California bill also urges the health department to establish permissible exposure limits: how much mold is too much?
Exactly what level of spores per cubic meter of air is enough to make us sick?
It may be an impossible task, because the same level of mold seems to affect every individual differently.
That would explain, among other things, why Ballard's husband is still so sick but Ballard herself is not.

''We don't always see the same health reaction every time,'' Johanning says.
''I've seen marriages go down because people are not equally affected by it and one spouse thinks the other is imagining things.''
Ron Allison sits in the overdecorated living room of the rented house that his family has been living in, staring straight ahead.
The furnishings around him are a swirl of burgundy and green, yellow and red, but he is a study in white and beige.
His expression is as bland and subdued as his clothing, as he tries, quietly and haltingly, to explain who he used to be and who he is today.
Back when he was an investment adviser, he says: ''I did three to four deals at a time, I kept all these balls in the air.
If I dialed your phone number once, I would have remembered it.''
''My problem is with input,'' he says, trying to explain what his doctors have since explained to him.
''I can concentrate on one thing for a while, but if you add a second thing, then the input makes me short-circuit.''
By way of example, his wife says, ''He can talk on the phone, but if you hand him a piece of paper while he's talking, his brain just fries.''
Allison was asked to quit his job nearly two years ago, according to Ballard, and has been going to cognitive therapy sessions four times a week.
''He's not worse, but he's not better,'' she says of her husband's progress.
''I guess we have to give it time.''
When not at therapy, he works at keeping his life simple.
''You can arrange your day to avoid feeling like an idiot,'' he says.
''Sitting here and watching 'Oprah,' you're not going to feel like an idiot, but I aimed a little higher than that in my life.
I'm going to remember only a small percentage of this conversation, but I still remember my old life, and I want it back.''
He worries about what his son, Reese, will think of him.
''He knows that I used to go to work in the morning and now I don't,'' he says.
You want to be the absolute best role model for your kids.
I'm not the best.
I'm far less.
I'm the best I can be now, but less than I was.''
Ballard worries about other things.
''Do you leave him?''
she asks me later, explaining that Allison is now more like her child than her husband.
''How can I leave him?
He can't take care of himself.
The worst day of our lives is still to come,'' she continues.
''The worst day will be if we finally get that money, and he'll want to manage it.''
That money is the $32 million she was awarded by a Texas jury in June, the result of her lawsuit against Farmers Insurance.
It is by far the largest judgment against an insurance company in a mold case.
Flynn, of Farmers, says the verdict (which the judge has sent to mediation) threatens not only the company but also the entire industry.

''As a practical matter she has almost single-handedly caused, well, not an hysteria, but a heightened interest in mold,'' Flynn says, choosing her words carefully.
''In the year or more since the start of this case, we are seeing claims for mold in and of itself.
People are filing claims from a fire that happened a year ago saying that mold arose from the fire-suppression activity.
They are about to go to mediation on a claim for a cracked foundation, and we get a letter a week before saying, 'by the way there's mold in the house and we have to tear it down.'
''
Until this case, she says: ''we didn't have any designation or coding for a mold claim.
As alarmed as the company is by the judgment, Farmers is relieved that the jury was only allowed to hear evidence about material damage to the house.
''Suppressing the medical testimony was extremely important to us,'' Flynn says.
''This is a property insurance policy,'' she explains.
''This is a policy that takes care of physical damage to the house.
This is not a medical policy.
It is not a type of policy ever intended to pay for a person's physical injuries while living in their homes.
If they develop a health problem, it should be covered by medical insurance.
That we should have said: 'Oh, you had a water leak a year ago and that leak might result in mold.
It could be toxic mold, and that could be injurious to your health so you'd better leave your house now.'
Ballard responded to the verdict by spending some of her expected payment to gather the sort of scientific evidence the judge and Farmers say does not yet exist.
Over this summer she plans to assemble some of the leading experts in the field, who, between them, have seen hundreds of patients suffering ''mold poisoning.''
She says she will ''lock them all in a conference room somewhere and ask them to compile a complete database, a profile of what we know.''
She has plans to invite representatives from the C.D.C., because, she says: ''You have to keep your enemies close.
If those S.O.B.
's are in from the beginning, they can't complain about our accuracy at the end.''
Out in California, where evidence rules are less stringent than in Texas, Alexander Robertson, too, is looking for future epidemiological data.
His ''laboratory'' is the Spectrum condominium complex, and he has contracted with an ''occ-doc'' from the Harvard Medical School to do a biostatistical study of every occupant.
All 1,500 residents will be asked about their symptoms, and their apartments will be tested to establish the presence and quantity of mold.
The residents of a control apartment complex will be similarly studied.
''If we show that the Spectrum building has a higher percentage of people reporting the same or similar symptoms, we go a long way to silencing those who argue mold can't be the cause,'' he says.
On my way back from Melinda Ballard's contaminated house, I stop at a highway gas station and change my clothes in the restroom.
I kick myself for not wearing long sleeves, long pants and combat boots when I went into the house, and wrap what I did wear -- shorts, T-shirt and flip flops -- in a double plastic bag and throw it in a nearby Dumpster so that the mold spores that might have settled on my clothing won't contaminate everything else I own.
I debate whether to go straight back to my hotel to take a shower but decide that I don't want to add water to the spores that might be in my hair.
I'd rather kill them first by spending time outside in the ultraviolet light.

David Straus says this is not overreacting.
Bill Holder says it probably is.
Melinda Ballard, who suggested these precautions in the first place, has become fed up with doing this herself and now saves one ratty outfit for visiting her old home.
Such is the murky level of knowledge at the moment about the dos and don'ts of toxic mold.
Dressed in fresh, uncontaminated clothes, with hair of questionable cleanliness, I go on to spend the evening at the home of an Austin friend.
We sit in her living room and talk with her new neighbors, Bridget and Ted Karam, who are renting a house for several months while their 4,700-square-foot dream home across the highway is inhabited by men in moon suits.
The house has leaked in the rain since it was built in 1993, the Karams say, but it wasn't until they read about the Ballard case that they thought to look for mold.
''We realized my daughter was waking up with sore throats every time she slept in her room,'' Bridget Karam says.
It will take nearly six months and cost $140,000 to clear it out.
Listening to their story, my throat starts to hurt.
So does my friend's.
''My kids wake up with sore throats all the time,'' she says, looking around her pristine living room, which suddenly smells a little musty.
''Maybe I should call someone to test us?''
Medical students develop symptoms of one disease after another as they go through their textbooks.
Called somatization, it is a testament to ''the power of suggestion,'' says Bachman of the American Insurance Association, which clearly has a stake in believing this is all in our heads.
I'm thinking that people are going through the same thing with mold.
Mold has always been around, it will always be around.
Why is everyone going so crazy about it right now?''
Nowhere are people going crazier than in Austin, where the Austin Independent School District closed the Hill Elementary School for the past 18 months and closed off sections of another school because of mold.
Now there is a wait of months for most contractors who screen for mold, and homeowners are hiring testers from Dallas and Houston, paying their travel expenses.
All this raises some obvious questions: Is there more toxic mold than ever before?
Is all the new construction, using cheaper, mold-friendly material causing a true invasion or are we just paying more attention?
Is this a new asbestos -- a new and measurable danger?
Or a new Legionnaire's disease -- a threat that has existed and been unrecognized for generations?
Or, perhaps a new chronic fatigue syndrome -- a disease that definitely affects some people while playing mind games with many more?
Do we really need to clean it up, or is it just that ''mold is gold,'' as contractors say, and there is money to be made from homeowners' fears.
These are questions that Ted Karam does not feel he has the luxury of pondering.
''I don't know how much is hysteria,'' he says.
''But I can't take any chances.
If you find it, you have to do something.''
The something varies, however, because no one seems to agree on the right thing to do.
And although they have read that Ballard left all her belongings in her house, they could not bring themselves to do the same.
They let their daughters sneak back in to rescue a few favorite outfits along with their yearbooks and some angel figurines.
Bridget, who is a professional photographer, took all her negatives.
''I can't bear to lose any of my memories,'' she says.

Tracy and Steve Wehmeyer, in contrast, who live across town from the Karams, began making plans to leave their home and most of their belongings within days of getting their results.
No one in the family had been terribly sick before Stachybotrys was discovered in their walls, but they aren't feeling too well right now.
''Every time I can't remember something, I wonder, Is it mold or is it wine or is it age?''
Tracy Wehmeyer says, half-joking.
Then she turns pensive.
''You think of your house as the safest place you can be.
Then to learn it is hurting you and your family.
. ''
She doesn't finish the sentence.
So far only one family in the Austin area has burned down their home.
Ballard says she has considered it, but was warned that the wind and smoke would simply spread the mold.
Her neighbor is already suing her for $1 million, saying that the very existence of the Ballard house has lowered area property values.
The Karams fear a financial toll, too.
Because of the history of mold, however, their bank's appraiser warns that it will be worth 30 percent less.
Ballard says she will wait until the case is completely closed before she touches her Dripping Springs home.
Then, when the house is no longer evidence, she will have it cut apart -- walls, beams, furniture, appliances, hardwood floors and all -- and shrouded piece by piece in double-wrapped plastic before being buried in a landfill.
She has other plans too.
She has announced her candidacy as a representative from the 46th District, and her hope is to sit on the insurance committee.
''Nearly everyone hates their insurance company,'' she says.
''What a platform.''
With pressure mounting to do something, anything, to help resuscitate the economy, the Bank of Japan's policy board began a two-day meeting today to discuss further easing of monetary policy in a country where short-term interest rates are already effectively zero.
Calls for further easing have been building since Junichiro Koizumi became prime minister in April on a promise to come to grips with the country's many structural and economic problems.
Among his government's pledges was speeding the foreclosure or write-off of billions of dollars in nonperforming bank loans, a policy which could lead to the elimination of thousands of jobs and worsen a nascent recession.
Over the weekend, the International Monetary Fund added its voice to the chorus of voices calling on the central bank to loosen its policy.
The fund urged the bank to enlarge Japan's money supply by stepping up targets for commercial banks' reserves in the central bank and by buying more bonds itself.
The fund's urgings, contained in its annual report on the Japanese economy, added support to calls by the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, and the minister for economic and fiscal policy, Heizo Takenaka, who have been prodding the bank to help offset the probable dampening effects of the Koizumi proposals on the economy.
Some analysts expect the central bank to yield to the pressure and announce ''extraordinary'' measures at the meeting's end on Tuesday, and bond prices reflected some hope of that today.
Investors bid up the benchmark 10-year government bond a bit, driving its yield down 0.015 points to 1.3 percent.
But the more prevalent view among economists is that the bank's governor, Masaru Hayami, who has said he believes that the bank's steps in February and March are sufficient, will persuade the board to leave monetary policy unchanged.
The Bank of Japan said today that it would further loosen credit in an economy in which short-term financing can already be raised at virtually no cost.
To inject liquidity into the financial system and help fight deflation, the bank said it would step up its purchases of government bonds 50 percent, to 600 billion yen ($4.9 billion) a month.
And it will increase the target amount of cash to be kept on deposit with it by the nation's commercial banks 20 percent, to 6 trillion yen ($49 billion).
This money is reinvested in the short-term money markets.
But evidence of deterioration in the economy has been accumulating, as are signs that the global economic slowdown is taking a toll in Japan, leading many economists here to conclude that an eventual loosening was inevitable.

Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Hayami noted that Japan's production was falling, corporate earnings were dropping and capital investment was waning.
Economic softness in the United States is likely to linger for a while, he said, while credit deterioration and worries about the soundness of Japan's big banks have beaten down bank stocks.
''One cannot help but think that the downside risks to the economy are becoming a reality,'' Mr. Hayami said, summing up the policy board's reasoning.
''We judged that we are now in a phase that requires additional easing measures.''
The surprise announcement sent stocks soaring, with the Nikkei 225-stock index rising 440.39 points, or nearly 4 percent, to 11,917.95.
But analysts doubted the moves would have any long-term effect on the markets beyond the shock value of a day or two.

But he, too, wondered how much practical impact would come from trying to pump money into the economy through the banks.
''Banks are writing off bad loans and lending less, so total lending is declining,'' he said.
''The central bank is boosting lending to those who do not need money.
The excess money has been flowing into government bonds.''
''I don't know to what extent the measure will stimulate companies, generate greater demand and raise prices,'' he said.
''But for the moment, this is all we can do.''
But he ruled out setting an inflation target, a policy both politicians and investors have called for.
''Inflation targeting is something you do when you have inflation,'' he said.
''I have never heard of it being carried out during times of deflation.''
Perhaps more to the point, analysts said, Mr. Hayami wants the central bank to avoid being held hostage to too many numerical goals.
With its industry reeling from a global slowdown in economic growth and from tightening credit at home, Brazil's economy managed to grow only a disappointing 0.79 percent in the second quarter compared with the period a year earlier, the government reported today.
''This is clearly a broader theme than the energy crisis,'' Marcelo Carvalho, chief economist at J. P. Morgan in São Paulo, said of the weak growth figures.
''This is overall macroeconomic conditions taking a downturn.
And growth in the third quarter will be worse, which means that the economy is in a recession.''
With the Brazilian central bank raising interest rates to defend the value of the currency, and demand weakening both at home and abroad, industrial growth slowed to 0.41 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.

The Brazilian government said it still forecast growth of 2.8 percent for all of 2001.
But analysts at J. P. Morgan and elsewhere have lowered their sights and now expect the full-year figure to come in below 1 percent.

After recovering from a financial crisis in the late 1990's, Brazil seemed to be firmly on a sustained growth track, expanding 4.5 percent in 2000 and 4.28 percent year-to-year in the first quarter of 2001.
But the financial crisis in neighboring Argentina began to undermine investors' confidence in Brazil, and the value of the Brazilian real started to erode, making imported goods much more expensive.
To head off the sinking real and the threat of inflation, the central bank has pushed its benchmark rate up 3.75 percentage points over the last 5 months, to 19 percent, but the real has nonetheless slumped 20 percent this year.
Restrictions are not expected to be lifted until next year.

The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, dropped 63.31 points, or 3.28 percent, to 1,867.01, bringing the week's loss to 4.57 percent.
Economists expect the Fed to cut short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year, reducing them at least one-quarter of a percentage point.
''It's a virtual certainty there will be an easing next Tuesday,'' said Rory Robertson, an interest-rate strategist at Macquarie Equities in New York.
''The only real outstanding question,'' he said, is whether it will be another quarter-point or whether the Fed will see a need to go for a half-point increase.
''The ongoing weakness in equities is a clear signal that equity investors are basically giving up on a quick rebound in growth,'' he added.
Dell was among those hit hard yesterday, falling $2.38, to $23.
The prospect of slumping demand for personal computers sent shares of other computer makers and related companies downward.

On a positive note, consumer confidence remains a bright spot in what is otherwise a sluggish economic environment.

But so far, it has seldom worked out that way.
Some critics accused the ministry of playing politics, saying that the board was dissolved because its chairman was a supporter of the Movement for Democratic Change, the leading opposition party.
Like its neighbors in southern Africa, Zimbabwe has been hit hard by the AIDS epidemic.
At least 25 percent of the country's adults are estimated to be H.I.V.
positive, according to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS agency.
A new study looking at more recent statistics, conducted by the Health Ministry and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reports that about 35 percent of the country's adults are now infected, Dr. Parirenyatwa said.
If the numbers are true, Zimbabwe's percentage of adults with H.I.V.
would be roughly equal to Botswana's, which is the highest in the world, and that would increase pressure on Zimbabwe to find a way to distribute the money from the AIDS trust.
Dr. Parirenyatwa acknowledged the problem of disbursing the money and ''doing it quickly enough,'' and he promised that it would soon be flowing steadily.
''When we started disbursing, we did it very quickly, but then people started complaining that you are giving to people who are not deserving, so now we are very careful.''

Dr. Sunanda Ray, the director of the Southern Africa AIDS Information Dissemination Service in Harare, said many of Zimbabwe's problems in distributing the money could have been avoided and should have been corrected by now.
''People are trying to provide the services on a shoestring,'' Dr. Ray said, ''and they are feeling the urgency, and it just seems outrageous that the bureaucrats are not able to respond.''

Whatever the source of the money, distributing it quickly and fairly is emerging as a crucial challenge for many African countries as more AIDS money comes their way, Robert Hecht, an associate director of Unaids, said in an interview from Geneva.
No other country has an AIDS tax like Zimbabwe's, but some, like Cameroon, are using debt relief savings to expand their AIDS budgets, while others, like Botswana, have been able to allocate more of their own budgets to fight AIDS.
With its deepening economic and political turmoil, Zimbabwe faces an even more dire predicament.
Hunger and unemployment are rising, making it harder for families to care for their dying relatives.
More than ever, people with AIDS need the sort of basic support that the national AIDS trust was set up to provide, things like blankets and pain relievers.
''If every person sees it on their pay slips, they feel they're contributing to this national cause,'' Mr. Hecht said, ''but if nothing is happening and they don't see any movement, people become cynical.
They say, 'What's happening to the money that I'm contributing?'
''
Indeed, the frustration at the pace of distribution has fed suspicion among ordinary people.
Some worry that the money will become a tool in the pre-election patronage machine of the ruling party, which must contend with national elections next year and a serious challenge from the opposition.
Others suspect that the money is somehow being manipulated by the cash-strapped government to pay for other needs like fuel imports or military expenses in the Congo.
''If the money is for H.I.V., then it must be used for H.I.V.,'' and it must not go to Congo or to offset any other costs, he said.
''Some of us are doctors.
How could we do that?''
In the coming weeks and months, Dr. Parirenyatwa said, the National AIDS Council will resume distributing money, with hundreds of thousands of dollars now set to go to each of the country's 81 local district governments, which now will have a central role in how the money is spent in their communities.
One of the lesser known economic successes of the past decade has been a significant improvement in giving low-income people access to the credit they need to buy homes.
In 1998, 13 percent of all new mortgages were so-called subprime loans -- made to borrowers who lack established credit histories, as many poor people do -- compared with 5 percent in 1994.
Subprime loans carry higher interest than is charged to most borrowers, who are in the ''prime'' category, but this is because subprime borrowers are more likely than others to default.
Lenders charge rates and fees consistent with the risks.
There is a dark side to subprime lending, however: loans that have been labeled predatory.
The term is applied most often to loans made to uninformed, low-income, elderly and minority borrowers who are pressured to sign new mortgages or refinance their current ones on onerous terms.
In loan ''flipping,'' for example, homeowners are tricked into complex refinancing even when it is disadvantageous to them.
In ''equity stripping,'' they end up paying high fees that substantially erode their equity in their homes.
In the worst cases, these practices end in borrowers' losing their homes.
The Senate Banking Committee has been holding hearings on predatory lending and considering whether to introduce a bill to halt it.
Such a bill would probably put limits on prepayment penalties, refinancing fees and credit life insurance premiums.
Clearly, lenders cannot be allowed to engage in practices that amount to fraud or that prey on Americans least equipped to defend themselves.
Yet what many policy makers may not realize is that federal officials already have ample legal authority to stop predatory lending.
They haven't done enough with it in the past, but that is changing, and it could change more.

The Federal Trade Commission has the authority to stop deceptive trade practices, and it is now using that power to investigate whether Citigroup tricked borrowers into paying high costs on subprime loans.
The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to regulate subprime lending practices and is in the process of adopting new rules that would help prevent flipping and equity stripping.

New laws on the pattern of some already passed at the state and local level could do great harm by discouraging lenders from making any subprime loans at all.
Laws that effectively limit fees and interest in mortgage contracts are tantamount to usury ceilings, which have generally been eliminated for a good reason: They force lenders to ration credit and thus deny funds to some borrowers.
In North Carolina, the Legislature enacted a statute in 1999 that punishes flipping and imposes new regulatory burdens and risks on high-cost lending.
Since then, subprime mortgage lending by finance companies in the state to borrowers with incomes below $25,000 has dropped by nearly 50 percent.
For those with incomes between $25,000 and $50,000, the drop has been one-third.
There are sensible ways to reduce predatory lending.
The Federal Reserve Board could require lenders to inform borrowers fully about prepayment penalties -- both by telling them personally and through easily understood documents.
The Fed can adopt rules to curb loan flipping, though if it does so, it should make clear to lenders what type of refinancings are permissible -- those that substantially reduce the borrower's monthly payment, for example.
New government-financed counseling programs for borrowers are also a good idea.
And the Fed, the F.T.C.
and the Department of Housing and Urban Development should send testers, masquerading as subprime loan applicants, to make sure lenders aren't engaging in predatory practices.
This is the sort of regulation that can stop predatory lending without taking back any of the new access to home ownership that millions of Americans have gained through subprime loans.
Following is the text of a statement by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, decided to lower interest rates:
The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 3 1/2 percent.
Today's action by the F.O.M.C.
brings the decline in the target federal funds rate since the beginning of the year to 300 basis points.
Household demand has been sustained, but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken, and growth abroad is slowing, weighing on the U.S. economy.
The associated easing of pressures on labor and product markets is expected to keep inflation contained.
Although long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable, the committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas.

There has been no formal talk of write-offs, sometimes called haircuts on Wall Street.
The threat of such losses, however, could encourage investors, including some American banks, to join a voluntary effort aimed at reducing Argentina's debt.

The possibility of losses down the road ''puts pressure on people'' to negotiate, said Ernest W. Brown, head of fixed-income and economics research at Santander Central Hispano Investment Securities.
''But you have to put a lot of pressure on people to get them to participate.''
Peter Marber, president of the Trust Company of the Atlantic, a money manager in Greenwich, Conn., who owns Argentine debt, said, ''I don't think anyone has talked about a haircut yet.''
But, he added, ''the debt has already essentially been haircut by the market.''
Despite a big rally yesterday, an index of Argentine bonds has plunged almost 25 percent since its high in February.
The $8 billion pledge, which won the endorsement of the Bush administration, improves the short-term outlook for Argentina.
There is no immediate threat of default on the country's $130 billion in debt or of a devaluation of its currency, which is tied to the dollar.

Investor relief sent Argentine stocks soaring yesterday, with the Merval index up 8.1 percent.
In Brazil, which has suffered the most from its neighbor's financial problems, stocks gained just 0.5 percent and finished below their highs of the day.
But the Brazilian currency, the real, rallied, rising 1.2 percent against the dollar.
The real has fallen almost 22 percent this year, intensifying Brazil's financial problems so much that the Bush administration and the I.M.F.
Investors remain wary about Argentina and the possible fallout from its woes on other emerging markets, although the ripple effects have been relatively contained so far.
Argentina has a long way to go in its economic plan, which calls for eliminating the federal government's deficit.
And with the United States, Europe and Japan all mired in slowdowns, Argentina may have real trouble turning its economy around, as it needs to do to achieve its goal.
''Argentina will continue to be a reason for investors who do not want to own emerging markets not to own them,'' said Philip Ehrmann, who oversees Pacific and emerging markets at Gartmore Investment Management in London.

One difficulty in gauging Argentina's outlook is that many details of the new program are still unclear.
The key, analysts said, is what Argentina will do to reduce its debt burden.
Horst Köhler, the managing director of the I.M.F., referred to such an effort when he said in a statement Tuesday, ''The authorities are also considering the possibility of a voluntary and market-based operation to increase the viability of Argentina's debt profile.''
Such a swap would probably include some guarantee of interest or principal or both that would make the exchange more attractive, they speculated.
While postponing interest and principal payments does reduce immediate income for investors, the swap could ease Argentina's financial problems.
Investors could then find themselves holding new bonds rising in value, offsetting their loss of immediate income.
And investors' principal would be preserved.
The American banks with hefty exposure in Latin America include FleetBoston, Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
After raising interest rates for five straight months to keep a lid on inflation, the Brazilian central bank left rates unchanged this month at 19 percent to avoid aggravating an economic slowdown that may lead to recession.

While most industrial countries are slowing down or worrying about a slowdown, Australia is surprisingly buoyant, the latest economic statistics show.
Analysts say the economy here will go on outperforming that of its trading partners for the rest of the year at least.
Almost every sector is looking up.
Home building is on the rise; consumer spending is strong; corporate profitability is improving.
Exports are booming, making the trade deficit narrower than it has been in decades.
The causes were mainly domestic, and fleeting, most notably a broad revamping of the country's tax system, including introduction of a general sales tax, which briefly depressed consumer confidence.
But this year, all systems have been go.
The economy grew 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2001 even though businesses were running down inventory in warehouses and store shelves, and economists expect second-quarter figures, due in mid-September, to be strong as well.
''But we're still growing, and we're growing faster than the United States and faster than Japan and faster than Europe,'' he said.

Two factors straight out of a macroeconomics textbook seem to have done the trick: A timely application of fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the good fortune to have a weak currency at a useful moment.
Together they have ''firewalled'' Australia, insulating it to an extent from slumps in demand elsewhere, said Glenn Maguire, chief economist at Société Générale's Australian unit.

The effects of interest rate cuts and election-year spending by the government of Prime Minister John Howard are easy to see in the construction industry, among the most vibrant here.
The Australian central bank expects other categories of construction to accelerate, too.
More broadly, consumer confidence has recovered from the dip last year and a new report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found generally strong balance sheets and profitability in corporate Australia, especially among exporters, whose products gain a big edge from the low exchange rate.
While the Australian dollar has rallied in recent weeks, trading at 53.46 United States cents today, it is down from a high of 59.27 United States cents a year ago.
Economists say Australia is humming along now in part because its experience of the 1990's boom years was more subdued than in the United States, and did not produce any major imbalances that needed correcting.
To be sure, there are pockets of trouble, notably from offshore.
And the cost advantage of a cheap currency will not be enough to sustain exporters if global economic growth turns really sluggish; miners and manufacturers will suffer if global demand contracts sharply.
The main threats to Australia's growth prospects now come from abroad, the central bank reported.
On the other hand, if global growth picks up as some forecasters hope, the conditions that are now sheltering Australia from the global slowdown could instead cause the economy to overheat, igniting inflation.
For the moment, though, the danger seems remote.
Those factors, Mr. James said of the stimulants, ''are shoring us up, rather than pushing us into overdrive.''
But while the business card is here to stay, some innovations may not be.
Experts say many offbeat cards don't work.
Cards with odd shapes, for example, can be good and bad -- they may be noticed, but they don't fit in traditional card holders.

Not all cards are meant to be handed out individually.
Some businesspeople leave stacks of them in high-traffic locations.
Michael Sigety, president of Pic A Card in Bloomingdale, N.J., provides hundreds of thousands of cards a month for companies to display in places like diners and supermarkets.
''And most people try to hang on to their wallets,'' he said.
Digital technology, instead of pushing business cards into extinction, has enhanced their reach.
''The more high tech we get, the more we need the soft touch,'' Mr. Vancelette said.
''More people are carrying business cards than in the past.''
Technology can work hand in hand with business cards.
Scanners, for example, can feed data from a business card into a computer database.
He also uses Vcards -- business cards that arrive as e-mail attachments and can be downloaded into a home computer or personal digital assistant.
The company produces business cards with bar codes printed on them.
The cards can be fed into a proprietary reader that downloads the data into a computer, bridging ''the gap between paper and the computer,'' said Kirk Korver, a vice president at the company.
The software, called RightCardReader, was more accurate than traditional software used by optical scanners for downloading business card data, he said,
David E. Carter, a marketing consultant who has written extensively on corporate identity, sees other trends.
For example, college students, particularly business majors, often carry cards to give to prospective employers.
Technological advances have paved the way for other changes, too.
More people are using desktop software to design and print cards at home There are holographic cards, scented cards and ''mood sensitive'' cards that react to body temperature.
Some businesses now distribute CD's to be run in a computer drive, creating a kind of multimedia business card.
Even traditional cards have moved beyond paper: some are printed on wood, plastic or metal.
Many are tiny works of art.
The graphic design world has taken note.
Rockport Publishers is compiling its fifth edition of ''The Best of Business Card Design.''

Pam Aviles, production director of the American Institute of Graphic Arts, a nonprofit organization in New York, said cards with printing on both sides, once considered taboo, were now practical because so much new information -- like e-mail addresses, cell phone numbers and other data -- must fit on them.

Now she hands out larger cards, featuring images from her portfolio on one side and contact information on the other.
The oversized cards have been enormously effective as mini-résumés.
''I've gotten some good jobs,'' she said.
David Formanek hopes that his new card will have the same impact.
Needing to expand his client base, Mr. Formanek is revamping his old card, a simple block print on tan paper.
Customers had always commented favorably on the logo he had used on his truck -- a cartoon figure with a light-bulb head, electrically charged red hair and sunglasses -- so he is putting the same figure on his new business cards.
''Almost all fail for the same reason,'' she said.
''They don't connect with their marketplace.''
But Ms. Grant, who offers business-card analysis for a fee on her Web site, www.giantpotatoes.com, said many problems could be easily fixed.
She said four of the most common mistakes were failing to mention the nature of the business clearly; overcrowding; being too impersonal; and making the print too small in crucial areas like phone and fax information.
Diana Ratliff, who publishes an online newsletter called the Business Card Bulletin on her Web site, www.businesscarddesign.com, also sees many ineffective cards.
She finds drawbacks, for example, in printing on the back side of the card because many people may never see it, or in using abbreviations and acronyms that may be understood only by industry insiders.
In conjunction with Linda Caroll, a graphic designer in Mississauga, Ontario, she ran a contest in her newsletter earlier this year, offering to fix the five business cards most in need of help.
''It's the kind of card, when you give it, people will say 'Wow!'
''
Glen Odiaga, owner of Elegant Remodelers, a contracting company in Highland Park, Ill., contacted Ms. Caroll several years ago about creating a card to reflect his upscale clientele.
''I needed to have something to make me stand out.''
The new card depicts two stately lions, back to back.
Mr. Odiaga says that in the last two years, business has doubled, and ''I think that business card started it all.''
Business cards have also attracted private collectors like Jack Gurner, a photographer in Water Valley, Miss.
He began accumulating cards in the 1970's, specializing in cards of other photographers, and now has more than 7,000 from that market niche.
Other collectors favor the cards of famous people or just try to collect as many cards as they can.
Mr. Gurner, a moderator of the International Business Card Collectors group, says members swap them like baseball cards.
There are, he said, legendary cards -- like that of Sitting Bull, said to be in a private collection in Los Angeles.
Mr. Gurner favors professionally designed cards over cards created on home computers.
''You wouldn't show up in running clothes for a business meeting,'' he said.
And Ms. Grant, who has also seen thousands of cards, often signs her book with this admonition: ''May your life be as interesting as your business card.''
To the Editor:
Re ''Federal Reserve Cuts Its Key Rate by Quarter-Point'' (front page, Aug. 22):
The Fed continues to cut the prime rate, making it easier for companies to borrow from banks to enable them to grow, thereby creating a vast increase in American employment, thus spurring the economy.
So the theory goes!
What in fact has been happening is that even with all this easy money, companies have not been expanding as anticipated.
Instead, they are using this windfall to merge with other companies, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs, further weakening the economy.
And all the while, the little guy watches the interest on his modest bank savings dwindle to nothing.
STANLEY BLOCK
Bronx, Aug. 22, 2001
Anyone who ever wanted to send a snorer to the moon may have been on to something.
A new study published in this month's issue of The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care says weightlessness virtually eliminates snoring.
In two shuttle flights in 1998, astronauts strapped one another into sleep harnesses that fed a variety of data into a digital ''sleep recorder.''
But snoring and the sleep interruptions from short halts in breathing, or sleep apnea, and from bursts of short and shallow breaths, called hyponea, virtually disappeared.
All three are associated with obstructions of the upper airways.
As to why astronauts toss and turn, the study could suggest only that the search needed to focus on something other than airway obstruction.
Signaling a more pessimistic outlook for the Canadian economy, the Bank of Canada cut its leading short-term interest rate today by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 4 percent.
The bank, which has eased monetary policy less aggressively than the United States Federal Reserve so far this year, said data released since the last rate reduction in mid-July ''suggest that the pace of growth of the Canadian economy has been slower than expected.''
The United States accounts for about four-fifths of Canada's exports, and American companies are among the biggest investors in Canada.
The bank also pointed to slowing economic growth outside North America.
As a result, the bank now expects economic growth in the third and fourth quarters of this year to be ''below potential, resulting in a lower level of activity than earlier expected.''

Robert Palombi, an economist at Standard & Poor's MMS in Toronto, said the implication was that ''we probably won't eliminate excess capacity until some time towards the second half of next year.''

The Bank of Canada has up to now taken a relatively upbeat view of domestic prospects, based on tax cuts earlier this year, a strong oil and gas sector and a softening Canadian dollar.
David Dodge, the bank's governor, predicted as recently as Aug. 1 that the economy would begin to strengthen in the second half of this year, and pick up further in 2002.
In keeping with this optimistic assessment, the Bank of Canada has lowered its target for the overnight interest rate by only 1.75 percentage points so far this year, compared with a three percentage point reduction in the United States federal funds rate.
Economists in Canada have, however, recently begun lowering their growth forecasts.
''There is a strong case to be made that the outperformance of the Canadian economy relative to its United States counterpart -- which has prevented the Bank of Canada from matching the Fed's rate cuts tit for tat -- has now run its course,'' Toronto-Dominion Bank said in an economic commentary.
Data on economic growth for the second quarter is due to be released Friday.
Mr. Palombi expects the second-quarter increase in gross domestic product to be 1.4 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in the previous three months.
It has already lasted since the spring of last year, when the boom suddenly gave way to tepid growth of less than 2 percent in each of the last four quarters.
''My best guess is that we will see a small positive number for the third quarter, maybe about 1 percent, possibly a bit more,'' said Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
Other forecasters, more optimistic than Mr. Baker, predicted that growth would reach 2 percent in the current quarter.
That would be a substantial improvement on the minuscule growth in the second quarter, but not enough to stop the layoffs and shrinking corporate profits that have been hallmarks of the weak economy over the last year.
''We have $40 billion in tax rebate checks to support the consumer in the coming weeks,'' noted Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
Several Wall Street analysts suggested that the growth, although slight, would suppress talk of recession in the media, and the worries that such speculation spurs.

Capital spending, also a big source of strength in the booming 1990's, declined for the second consecutive quarter, shrinking at an unusually large annual rate of 14.6 percent.
With profits shrinking, there is not much incentive to invest in new computers, machinery and all the other tools used to produce goods and services.
A broad inflation index that is included in the output report -- a broader measure than the widely cited Consumer Price Index -- suggested that the inflation rate was inching down.
The index of gross domestic purchase prices, which covers purchases by households, business and government, rose at a very mild 1.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter compared with 2.7 percent in the first.
A falling inflation rate removes an obstacle to further reductions in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet again in October.
To spur borrowing and encourage spending, the Fed has already cut short-term interest rates seven times since January.
With growth slowing in Europe and Asia, exports from the United States fell more than originally estimated.
Even more troubling, in Mr. Hooper's view, market indexes, having drifted down in recent weeks, are near their lows of last spring.
''If stock prices drop noticeably more, then the likelihood of consumers' continuing to expand their spending, even at the moderate second-quarter pace of 2.5 percent a year, goes down,'' he said.
''And if consumer spending stops growing, that means either that inventories will go up tremendously or firms will have to cut production.''
Other analysts noted that if many employers emulate the Ford Motor Company's newly announced decision to eliminate executive bonuses, such actions could also translate into a drop in consumer spending.
So far, though, consumers do not seem to be pulling back.
And factory production, which had been falling for months, stopped doing so last month.

''As long as the consumer holds up,'' Mr. Hooper said, ''we are likely to see this sort of improvement.''
''The problem with this kind of thinking is that there's no way to dispel it,'' said John Manley, senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
Until economic indicators point to recovery and corporate profits show signs of reaching a bottom, he said, investors will worry that job cuts will lead to a recessionary spiral.

The Dow and S.& P. 500 now stand within 5 percent of the lows they set in April, while the Nasdaq is less than 10 percent above its April low, and down nearly 65 percent from its high in March 2000.
The Nasdaq broke through the 1,800 level, skidding 51.49 points, to 1,791.68, after Sun Microsystems, which makes computer servers, said its sales would fall short of forecasts.
So far this week, the Dow is down 4.8 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index has lost 6.5 percent.
Lurking in the back of some professional investors' minds is a recent drop in Japanese stock prices, which initially collapsed in 1990 and have moved erratically lower since.
Japan has recently received attention as the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks has fallen to a point where it now trades at almost the same numerical level as the Dow industrials.
''I was once as you are now.
That's the philosophical implication.''
Besides, the new weakness in Japanese stock prices reflects a belief that the nation's economy will probably not recover any time soon, Mr. Manley said, adding, ''You have both the nasty example of the past and the concerns about the present.''

''The tendency of the American consumer to spend probably does stand us in pretty good stead,'' he said.
Mr. Manley expects the S.& P. 500 index to rise to a level near 1,500 by the end of 2002, although he says that the next several months could be rocky.
Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale and author of ''Irrational Exuberance,'' said that stocks might recover much more slowly than investors would like.
''We're just emerging from the biggest bull market in history,'' Mr. Shiller said.
''We kind of lost our moorings in the stock market.''
But in reality, shifts in market psychology come slowly.
Stocks are ''gradually fading,'' Mr. Shiller said, ''but that's how markets unwind themselves.''

Some professional money managers were more optimistic.
James M. Weiss, chief investment officer at State Street Research, said people forget that interest rate cuts take time to stimulate the economy.
The Federal Reserve has cut short-term rates seven times since the beginning of the year to help the economy by lowering the borrowing costs of companies and consumers.
Eventually, he said, those rate cuts will work, but Wall Street is impatient.
''People have forgotten the lessons of post-World War II cycles, of which we had nine from 1946 to 1990,'' Mr. Weiss said, ''and they've forgotten the lessons of how monetary policy works.''
Usually, the Fed's cuts take at least six to nine months to be effective, he added.
''We have lower rates, lower taxes, lower energy prices, and mortgage refinances,'' Mr. Weiss said.
''I just don't see the economy taking another leg down in 2002.''
''The dramatic drop in the Nasdaq and the rather substantial drop in the Standard & Poor's 500, in my view, has been driven by the collapse in the technology and telecom sectors,'' he said.
''To extrapolate from this phenomenon that the whole economy is collapsing is incorrect.''

Treasuries Are Lower
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices declined yesterday despite further selling in the stock market.
The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.80 percent from 4.76 percent on Wednesday.
The Korea Stock Exchange fell 3.1 percent, closing the month at 546.95, the lowest point since the last day of July.
The Bank of Korea is expected to consider another cut in the interest rate next week.

She finished carrying Maggie on the loop to where the rest of us were standing, awaiting rides of our own.

Maggie, who is prevented by allergies from riding a horse or owning a cat or petting a dog, beamed as she got off.
Could this encounter possibly have been a crime against nature?
Some think so.
''We believe that it causes the dolphins extra stress, that they become more aggressive and may cause injury,'' said Cathy Williamson, a spokeswoman for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society
Ms. Williamson is one of a number of animal rights activists and marine mammal specialists who believe that dolphins can grow frustrated when forced to interact with swimmers, some of whom may be constantly trying to touch them.
The activists say the constant stress also poses long-term health risks for the animals.
Discovery Cove says it has never had a swimmer seriously injured by one of its dolphins, and federal researchers say that programs of its kind, where a professional staff directs the encounters with trained animals, are generally safe.
Participants in less structured programs, where people swim freely with untrained animals, have occasionally suffered scratches, bruised ribs or even a broken arm when they were bumped or bitten by dolphins, which typically weigh more than 500 pounds and average eight to nine feet in length.
Even in those settings, though, the available data (federal statistics from 1989 to 1994, when dolphin-swim programs were required to report injuries) indicate that the incidence of injury is not high.
Animal rights proponents contend that the dangers will grow with the boom in dolphin swim programs.
Once an activity largely encountered in dreams, swimming with dolphins is now available at 14 programs in the United States, up from 4 just seven years ago, according to federal officials.
Dozens of other such programs exist worldwide.
Some in the Caribbean and Mexico have been accused of overworking the dolphins and of being understaffed.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
''I do believe that there are differences between the programs,'' said Dr. Toni Frohoff, a consultant with the Humane Society of the United States, who has studied dolphin swim programs.
''I don't believe that just because one program is better than another that it means it is safe or educational.''
Dr. Frohoff's sentiments are heresy at Discovery Cove, which promotes its educational and research efforts as central to its mission.
SeaWorld, the park's parent company (owned by Anheuser-Busch), reports spending $2 million a year on animal research and rescue operations.
Discovery Cove itself lists a staff of 70 trainers, and new trainers undertake a yearlong apprenticeship before they are allowed to direct a dolphin encounter.
A medical staff of three cares for dolphins in a segregated medical pool, and there are six other 40-foot-wide holding pools, as well as three 200-foot-long man-made lagoons for Discovery Cove's 28 dolphins.
None ever spend more than three hours a day interacting with swimmers, according to Frank Murru, the general manager.
He said studies have shown that interactive dolphins exhibit no greater stress than others held in captivity.
The park's own blood tests, he said, confirm those findings.
''All the times when they are supposedly under stress, we see no elevated levels of cortisole, which is an indicator of stress,'' he said.
By and large, that is what we got.
The park recreates a tropical setting somewhere between Fantasy Island and Margaritaville, with thatch-roof buildings, clear blue lagoons and winding trails spotted with wildflowers.

Perhaps if I spent less time at meals my suit would have made me feel more like a dashing character from an underwater adventure show.
Instead, I felt like a sausage.
But even if you share my shape, take the suit.
The water temperatures in the park are kept cooler (73 to 75 degrees) in spots to match the dolphins' habitats.
Appropriately outfitted, we spent several hours snorkeling among tropical fish and stingrays, past the sunken artifacts of a lost civilization and several tanks of sharks and barracuda artfully placed behind plexiglass in mock shipwrecks.
At one point, our journey took us through a cave and under a waterfall to an aviary filled with brightly colored birds, to whom we fed small insects supplied by the park.
Then we had lunch ourselves (burgers, stir-fry chicken, fajitas, salads and chocolate chip cookies) on a landscaped patio overlooking the beach.
It's like sticking your fingers near a person's nose.
We were somewhat disappointed to learn we would not be swimming freely with the dolphins.
I had imagined cruising along beside them, just another free spirit in the lagoon.
But Trevor Spradlin, a dolphin specialist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, later told me that the less-controlled programs are linked to higher rates of aggressive behavior and injury.
Most dangerous of all, experts said, are encounters precipitated when people just jump from boats for impromptu swims with dolphins in the wild.

''The smile on the dolphin's face is not an emotional expression,'' Dr. Frohoff said, ''and I do believe that a lot of the dolphin shows and dolphin swim programs perpetuate an image of the dolphin as a fun, happy, playlike animal that is no more wild or dangerous than a domestic dog or a circus poodle.''
And Mr. Spradlin said: ''We need zoos and aquariums to tell people this is a special experience.
That these are trained animals in a controlled setting.
But wild animals are just that.
They are wild.''
Several weeks after our return, I told my wife, Mary, of the controversy surrounding dolphin swim programs.
''People who go to swim with dolphins are already in love with the animals,'' she said.

Buddy system
Discovery Cove, Central Florida Parkway, Orlando, Fla. 32168, (877) 434-7268, www.discoverycove.com, is across the street from its parent theme park, SeaWorld.
Reservations are required and are quickly filled.
A spokesman suggested making reservations at least four to six weeks ahead.
Even more lead time is required for peak periods, like the school breaks near Easter and Christmas.
The charge for the regular dolphin swim package is $199 a person.
In addition to the dolphin swim and other attractions at Discovery Cove, the price includes a seven-day pass to SeaWorld, where we spent an enjoyable day and could have spent two.
Also included are the use of snorkeling equipment, wet suits, beach chairs, sunscreen and towels as well as parking and lunch.
Alcoholic drinks are extra ($4.99 for piña coladas).
Children must be at least 6 to swim with the dolphins.
Nonswimmers are welcome, and for those who do not want to swim with the dolphins, but would like to visit the rest of the park, the cost is $109.
There is also a Trainer-for-a-Day package, which includes a full day of behind-the-scenes experiences with the animals, including feeding them.
This costs $369.
The park is open 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Arrive early if you have a strong preference for when you want to swim with the dolphins; times are given out first come first served.
Swimmers are not allowed to take cameras into the water.
Discovery Cove provides photographers in the water who will later sell you the pictures for an average of $15 a shot; they also sell videotapes of the session ($39.99).
You also can have a nonswimmer take pictures with your camera from shore.

Now the state government is in the numbers racket, but it pays out less than 50 percent in prizes and subjects us to misleading advertising that no private company would be allowed to run.
A million dollars, paid out at $50,000 a year over 20 years, is not a million dollars -- it's closer to $500,000 in present value, depending on interest rates at the time.
People should not be allowed to gamble until they demonstrate that they know how to calculate the chance of, say, rolling a four with two dice.

Harbor Springs, Mich., Aug. 29, 2001
The pitchers' parents are superstitious and have concluded that their son pitches poorly whenever Malcolm Mussina, his father, watches Mike on television or in person.
Before Sunday's nationally televised game, Malcolm Mussina -- Big Mike, as he is called in the family -- went to the workshop at Mike's house and listened to the game on radio; the Yankees' broadcasts are carried on a local AM station.

Ellie Mussina watched the game at home, her anxiety increasing inning by inning, undoubtedly fed because neither team could score, and by the increasingly tense images on ESPN -- her son sitting silently in the dugout when he was not pitching, David Cone's reddened face as he fought furiously to prevent the Yankees from scoring, Mussina's teammates watching and appearing far more distressed than Mussina.
Mussina came out to pitch the bottom of the ninth and virtually all of his teammates were standing in the Yankees' dugout, Roger Clemens clapping, exhorting Mussina.
Ellie Mussina's phone rang two separate times; she would not answer.
Cone had been removed from the game in the top of the ninth but he stayed in the dugout to watch the bottom of the ninth, rooting against Mussina, rooting for him.

Mussina came within two outs of a perfect game in 1997, within four outs in 1998, while pitching for Baltimore.
''He was going for a strikeout.''
A clean hit.
Ellie Mussina could see the disappointment in her son's face after the game.
From that day to this, it has been my favorite, too -- as good a reason for visiting the gastronomically rich area centered on Lyon as the region's celebrated restaurants, like Bocuse and Troisgros, Pic and Blanc and Chapel.

For it is no great traveler, this firm little package with (at its best) such unctuous insides.
I have eaten pretty fair Roquefort in Hong Kong and delicious vacherin in Italy and more than acceptable cheddar in the United States, to name three other obvious candidates for the title of the World's Greatest Cheese.
But precious few prime St.-Marcellins are to be found more than a hundred miles or so from their birthplace in southeast France.
There are exceptions, of course, but not very many.
Unfortunately, that includes most -- but thankfully not all -- of the St.-Marcellins you are likely to find in the United States.
ST.-MARCELLIN is a village of 6,500 people in the valley of the rushing River Isère, which tumbles down from the Alps past Grenoble to the Rhone.
To get there, you turn off the A7 motorway at Tournon and head east through pear, apricot and peach orchards that were brightened by glorious fields of sunflowers on the July day when my wife, Betsey, and I made the trip.
(The Isère valley also produces the eau de vie de poire that Mme.
Point used to serve.)
The mountains, whose north face is covered with snow even in midsummer, loom picturesquely above St.-Marcellin.
With streets and squares shaded by plane trees and cedars, the village itself has a certain bucolic charm, especially on market days, when merchants set up their stalls around an old bandstand with ornate stained-glass panels bearing the names of Wagner, Rameau and Rossini.
We did a little business with Marie-Claire Reveillac, a plump, smiling woman who comes into town three times a week to sell the St.-Marcellins that she makes on her farm near the neighboring hamlet of St.-Vérand.
When I asked her how long she had been making cheese, she replied, ''All my life,'' which may be why she does it the old-fashioned way, using a little goat's milk along with the more usual cow's milk.
Like children, St.-Marcellins need a careful upbringing to show their stuff.
That process is best carried out by what the French call an affineur, or maturer, or, sometimes, an éleveur, which means much the same thing.
Like artisanal cheeses themselves, traditional affineurs are a threatened species; there are probably not more than a couple of dozen left in all of France.
Those who survive buy directly from the cheesemaker or from a regional co-operative and bring their cheeses to perfect ripeness in their own cellars, which are often made of limestone.
In the case of St.-Marcellins, the proper amount of aging, which varies from cheese to cheese, produces a supple exterior crust and a slightly runny, magnificently rich interior -- not as strongly flavored as Maroilles, the sweaty-socks cheese, or even Livarot, the most pungent of the fine Normandy cheeses, but voluptuous and by no means bland.
The texture and the ivory color remind me of Devon cream.

At its very best, St.-Marcellin has a mild smell, with no trace of ammonia or putrescence in the aroma, and a fine, slightly nutty, distinctly lactic taste that builds up to a little bite at the end.
''Il pique la langue,'' -- it stings the tongue -- I once heard a happy client cry in a bistro in Lyon.
He shouted for help, and two woodcutters came to his rescue, taking him to their cabin and feeding him bread and a local cheese.
St. Marcellin was on Louis's table in the Louvre Palace by 1461, warranted by the king, and for 500 years now it has been known as a king among cheeses.

At the Cheese Museum here, we learned that St.-Marcellins are first mentioned in manuscripts written in 1251.
From 1980 on, the cheeses have been made exclusively from cow's milk, mostly from a brown-and-white breed called Montbéliard (although a few stubborn peasants like Mme.
More than 700 farmers in the two hilly departments that lie between Grenoble and Valence, the Drôme and the Isère, produce milk for St.-Marcellin.
Many of them are clustered around villages just upriver from here, like Izeron, Têche, Vinay and Rovon.
Vinay is particularly charming, with old stone and timber houses; it calls itself ''the walnut capital,'' and people there and elsewhere in the Isère valley eat walnuts with their St.-Marcellin.
Cheese is made on 15 farms and in 12 small-scale factories -- 35 million St.-Marcellins a year, consuming roughly 15 million gallons of raw milk.
St.-Marcellin is a source of fierce local pride.
''Pour votre pique-nique.''
The manufacturing process is simple: the milk is heated, rennet is added, and the curd is poured into round molds pierced by holes that allow the whey to drain off.
It is fed to pigs.
Unmolded, the disks are salted on each side and placed on racks to mature.
Enter the affineur.
Combining experience, a watchful eye and a sensitive nose, he or she knows what to buy and when to send the cheeses to market.
The best St.-Marcellins go on sale in summer and early fall, flavored by the tender young grasses the cows nibble in spring.
THERE are plenty of good affineurs in the region, and some farther afield.
The two best in Paris, in my view, are Roger Alleosse at 13, rue Poncelet, near the Arc de Triomphe in the 17th Arrondissement, and Marie-Anne Cantin, at 12, rue du Champs de Mars, across the Seine in the Seventh.
The crowds of customers that often spill out into the street at these two shops are testimony enough to their proprietors' skills.
Both of them make a specialty of St.-Marcellin.

Jean d'Alos in Bordeaux is equally gifted, as is Philippe Olivier in Boulogne-sur-Mer on the English Channel.
His cheeses grace the tables of many of the best restaurants in London and the English countryside, and they are also served at Buckingham Palace.
But the champion affineur of St.-Marcellin, without doubt, is Renée Richard, a vibrant blonde who runs a stall in the Lyon central market with her daughter, also named Renée.
At the grand gastronomic temples of the region, at Jean-Paul Lacombe's wonderful Léon de Lyon and at most of the working-men's bouchons like Chez Georges and Chez Hugon, you will be served St.-Marcellins wrapped in her trademark red-and-white paper.
Even Mme.
Richard's Lyon rivals, such as the excellent Alain Martinet, whose yellow-and-black-wrapped cheeses are a little sourer and a little less sharp, might grant her primacy.
Few people can resist her brassy, wise-cracking charm any more than her cheeses, and few want to.
In his book ''The French at Table'' (Morrow, 1985), the American writer Rudolph Chelminski tellingly describes her as ''the Wife of Bath incarnate.''
Unhappily, there is no American Renée Richard.
Most St.-Marcellins that reach these shores are made from pasteurized milk; federal regulations forbid the importation of raw milk (''lait cru'') cheeses less than 60 days old, and St.-Marcellins are pretty far gone by then.
Ed Edelman, the owner of the Ideal Cheese Shop in Manhattan, has stopped selling the pasteurized version, which he dismisses as ''glorified cream cheese,'' but he and a few other zealous cheese merchants around the country occasionally manage to stock the real thing.
''Most of what we can get is not worth having,'' said Max McCalman, the cheese director at Terrance Brennan's two New York restaurants, Picholine and Artisanal, and the co-author, with David Gibbons, of the forthcoming book ''The Cheese Plate'' (Clarkson Potter, 2002).
''It's been a while since I've tasted a raw milk St.-Marcellin, but I can certainly remember that it was one of the best things I've ever had in my mouth.
It's a cheese of the future for us, I would hope, and in the meantime, it's a good excuse to go to Lyon.''
Alexandra's wardrobe kick-starts ''Dress Rehearsal: Origins of the Costume Institute'' at the Metropolitan Museum.
The show, intended to suggest the institute's scope, gives a taste of its collection -- said to be one of the world's largest and best known -- of more than 80,000 costumes and accessories.

This segment runs from the late 18th century to the mid-20th, with a few later inclusions.
Apart from Alexandra's, most of the items among the more than 75 garments and accessories displayed here are arranged in a time line of changing styles and silhouettes, from just before the French Revolution (hard on finery) to the beginning of World War II.
A smaller display is devoted to folk costumes from around the world, and a fourth presents recent acquisitions, including, interestingly enough, a 1989 ball gown worn by the consort of another prince of Wales, Alexandra's great-great-granddaughter-in-law, Diana.
A long, slim flow of a dress in white silk chiffon printed with purple tulips, for all its halter neckline it seems less sexy than Alexandra's.
Their collection included high-style European and American fashion as well as more everyday clothes, including a homespun cotton dress from Appalachia as well as a range of ethnic costumes.
Reborn as the Costume Institute, it has continued for 55 years along the lines established by its predecessor as an archive based on the principles of design rather than historical association (although as indicated by the Alexandra display, history is by no means ruled out).
The timeline installation begins with a sumptuous French caraco, or loose jacketed dress, of yellow silk satin (circa 1778).
Long but exposing the feet, it has a looseness that expressed women's increasing need to move around more easily.
Examples of that include an American robe à l'anglaise (circa 1770), an open robe over a fitted bodice and full skirt that parts in front to reveal a matching petticoat.

Among the new modes was the sexy Empire dress, named for the French empire under Napoleon but looking back to the garb of classical antiquity.
A handsome example here is an open-robe English dress of 1795: a long white gown with an overmantle of yellow-and-white-striped satin, which forms a tight band under the bust, then is led by straps to flow back over the shoulders in a long cape.

The inflated silhouette returned with a bang in the first third of the 19th century, as part of a Romantic movement that reacted to the classical.
A wonderful midcentury example is a day dress (1853-56) of ivory silk printed in a colored floral pattern.
The skirt has no fewer than five tiered flounces, and each sleeve has two.
An American day dress (circa 1857), with a tight bodice, a very full skirt and long coatlike sleeves, stands out with its loud fabric of plaid silk in greens, reds and blues (made possible by the invention of chemical dyes in the mid-1850's).
Following the look of traditional men's wear, they reflected women's increasingly active lives.
A stunning example is an English day suit (1911-13) of ivory-and-black striped wool trimmed with black satin, whose snappy jacket, worn over a simple long-line dress, sports big white buttons edged in black.
Arresting creations by name designers, like Madeleine Vionnet and Jessie Franklin Turner, enhance the display.
A soignée Turner evening dress of the late 1920's borders a loose-fitting, chemise-shaped top of polychrome silk with a length of green velvet, which extends into a train.
Vionnet's slim-line dress (1926-27) of maroon silk crepe is an ingenious exercise in bias cutting, with pieces stitched together by fine pin-tuck ribbing that serves at once as structure and design element.
Examples of Greek, Moravian, Swedish, Slovak, Burmese, Spanish, Turkmen, Turkish and other costumes are on display along with more recent acquisitions of African tribal dress.
One stunner is a 19th- or 20th-century man's ceremonial garment from the Kuba peoples of the Congo.
Of raffia embellished with shell, glass, beads and leather, it is essentially a bushlike skirt woven in a checkerboard pattern, which hangs on the body by means of shell-beaded straps across the naked chest.
It makes a cool contrast with two items in the case devoted to new Western-style acquisitions.
One is an English man's suit (circa 1750) of purple wool whose long jacket, worn over a long vest and knee breeches, is decked out with lots of gold braid.
The other is a boxy jacket and pants in a wrinkly brown paperlike fabric designed almost 250 years later (1998) by the Pop painter James Rosenquist for the men's wear manufacturer Hugo Boss.
But the Kuba outfit has the most zip.
Let's hear it for men's skirts!
''Dress Rehearsal: Origins of the Costume Institute'' remains on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Oct. 28.
''I want the American people to know we're deeply concerned about the unemployment rates and we intend to do something about it,'' he said.
He did not say, though, what he intended to do, beyond pushing for policies he had been pressing for all along and waiting for his tax cut to give the economy a kick.
They included seeking authority from Congress to negotiate international trade agreements.
Such a step might benefit the economy in the long run by increasing opportunities to sell American goods abroad, but would be unlikely to come in time to influence the current business cycle.
Mr. Bush also renewed his call for Congress to take steps, like opening up new areas to oil and gas drilling and reducing regulatory restrictions on energy companies to reduce energy costs.
Energy prices, however, have already fallen in recent months without any major actions by the government, substantially reducing their drag on the economy.

Further cuts in income tax rates will take effect in January.
''The unemployment level now is at the highest it has been in four years,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader.
''We're at 4.9 percent, and that's intolerable.
I think it's a reflection, unfortunately, of the Bush budget and the Bush economy.''

Democrats have been working to link the shrinking budget surplus to questions about Mr. Bush's economic management, in part by arguing that Mr. Bush's tax cut is forcing the government to violate pledges by both parties not to use excess money generated by the Social Security tax for other government programs.
Last month, the White House projected that the government would barely avoid spending any Social Security money for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
A few Republicans, including Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, have suggested that using part of the retirement system's surplus would be an acceptable way to ease pressure on the economy and the budget.
Mr. Bush and most Republican leaders, however, have stuck to their vows not to touch the Social Security money.
Some Republicans floated a plan today under which any further dissipation of the surplus next year that might force the budget to use Social Security money would lead to an automatic across-the-board spending cut.
Among them, they said, was concern that cutting spending in response to a weakening economy would run counter to the traditional economic theory of what a government should do when confronted with a recession or the risk of one.
Typically, governments have increased spending during economic slowdowns to give the economy a boost; cutting spending at such times would risk harming the economy, economists say.

While they may seem too melodramatic and implausible even for a movie, the events just recounted are in fact incidents from the life of Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Puller, for most of his life called Chesty.
They and many others are recounted in detail in this new biography of Puller by Lt. Col. Jon T. Hoffman, a widely published military historian and analyst who is now deputy director of the Marine Corps History and Museums Division.

Puller, the winner of five Navy Crosses, is the unrivaled symbol of heroism and exemplary leadership in the Marine Corps.
On Guadalcanal one correspondent described him as ''an inspiring leader of men, a 'fighting fool,' a kind and tolerant officer and above all a fearless warrior.''
Yet he is probably the subject of more stories and tall tales than all of the others combined.
His practice was to insist that his officers wait their turn in line with the enlisted men to be fed or to visit the PX.
Hoffman tells of one lieutenant who, aware of Chesty's dictum, had waited in a long line at the PX.
Hoffman is a model biographer for Puller -- admiring and sympathetic but firmly determined to separate fact from legend.
Much to my disappointment, Hoffman demonstrates that Puller never told his men during the Chosin campaign: ''We've been looking for the enemy for several days now.
We've finally found them.
We're surrounded.
That simplifies things.''
Hoffman also shows that Puller's involuntary retirement from the Marine Corps was in fact for ill health -- including a stroke and a serious heart problem -- and not a punishment for outspokenness, as he always claimed.
Hoffman defends Puller against charges that his style of leadership always resulted in heavy casualties.
On the other hand he criticizes Puller for mistakes in judgment during the retreat from Chosin.
Unfortunately Hoffman's in-depth analyses of Puller's battles are far too complex for the simple maps provided, and even with good maps they would probably prove too difficult for the lay reader to follow.
Similarly, only an aficionado will probably be interested in his detailed account of Chesty's numerous patrols and firefights in Nicaragua.
Yet just as Douglas MacArthur arouses the curiosity of many who have no interest in Hollandia or Inchon, so Puller's story will appeal to many who wish to know more about one of the great combat leaders of the last century.
The politics of handling the economy have shifted rapidly just since Friday, when the government reported that unemployment last month surged to 4.9 percent from 4.5 percent in July.

Democrats are seeking to pin the blame for the economy on Mr. Bush.
They are linking the slowdown in growth and the rise in unemployment to their argument that Mr. Bush squandered the federal budget surplus by pushing through an irresponsible tax cut.
''It's his budget, it's his economy, it's his tax cut, it's his solution,'' Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said today on ABC's ''This Week.''
But a number of Democrats said today that they, too, might support further economic stimulus, especially as part of a deal to scale back the longer-term components of Mr. Bush's tax cut.
One idea mentioned by several Democrats was an immediate tax cut that would extend even to people who do not make enough money to pay federal income taxes.
One such measure would temporarily reduce the payroll tax that finances Social Security.
This would reduce the current surplus in the retirement trust fund, but would not divert the trust fund into government spending, or concentrate another round of tax cuts on the wealthy.
''We'd want to do something to put money in people's pockets quickly,'' Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
Any agreement could be hampered by the partisanship that has surrounded the budget, and by the pledges of both parties to avoid spending any portion of the budget surplus generated by Social Security.
To a large degree, the political decisions in the weeks ahead will be driven by the economy.
Economists have lacked success in predicting downturns or calling the moment at which a weakened economy starts to recover, and there is considerable debate right now about just where in the cycle this economy is.
The risks of protracted economic weakness, they said, are beginning to weigh more heavily on consumers, investors and politicians, all of whom had grown optimistic and perhaps complacent with prosperity.

''I don't know whether we're in a recession or not, but people are looking around and getting scared,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a research group in Washington.
''That in itself can be a negative factor.''
One result has been to focus new scrutiny on the limited policy choices available.
The Federal Reserve has already cut interest rates seven times this year.
Although the Fed is likely to continue doing so, at this point it is mostly waiting for past rate cuts to be felt, a process that usually takes six to nine months.
For the administration and Congress, the question is how to reconcile their growing interest in tax cuts or spending increases -- the traditional fiscal responses to a flagging economy -- with their pledge not to touch the portion of the budget surplus generated by Social Security.

But for now the White House and both parties in Congress are assuming that is not an option.
Although the economy still seems to be moving ahead, it has decelerated so sharply that businesses and individuals might feel like they have hit a wall, analysts said.
The economy's growth rate has dropped from a robust 5.7 percent during the spring of last year to just two-tenths of one percent in the same period this year, its weakest performance in eight years.
Typically, a drop-off of that magnitude would mean a swing from an expanding economy to a shrinking one, the primary attribute of a recession.
Moreover, the indicator that more than any other brings economic difficulty home -- joblessness -- has now shot up by a full percentage point in 10 months, from 3.9 percent last October to 4.9 percent in August.
''It's a very powerful policy and psychological point, because it feels like you've fallen off a cliff,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington.
The prevailing view among economists has been that the economy would begin to recover by the end of the year, and there is still considerable evidence to support that outlook.

The tax cut is putting $38 billion worth of rebate checks into the hands of consumers in a 10-week period.
The sharp slide in manufacturing seems to be leveling off.
New claims for unemployment insurance may have peaked.
But there are considerable risks, including the spread of economic weakness around the world, especially in Japan.
Although Mr. Bush has been noncommittal about cutting the capital gains tax, Republicans said that Mr. Hastert is likely to bring a bill to the floor of the House within the next month or so.
Conveniently, such a change might actually raise more money for the government in the first year or two by encouraging investors to sell stocks they might otherwise hold on to.
In that way, the tax cut would not force Congress to break its Social Security pledge.
Even as they talk about fiscal stimulus, House Republicans are also pressing for an automatic, across-the-board cut in government spending in the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
The cuts would be equal to the amount of the Social Security surplus the government is spending this year, allowing Congress to say it has paid back any money taken from Social Security.
The Congressional Budget Office projected last month that the budget would dip into Social Security by $9 billion this year, an estimate the White House no longer disputes.
But neither party in the Senate is enthusiastic about trying to cut spending across the board.
In addition to being hard to carry out, cutting spending in the face of a recession might actually slow the economy further.
After accounting for the slowing economy and the tax cut signed into law by Mr. Bush in June, the Congressional Budget Office projected last month that the government would spend $9 billion of Social Security receipts in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
Both parties now expect that figure to be higher.

The White House sent a memorandum to all cabinet agencies today asking them to look for possible budget cuts as the administration develops tax and spending proposals for its next budget.
Workers who do not make enough money to pay federal income taxes but who still pay the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare will not receive rebate checks this year.
''I would like to at least see how that would work, discuss it with Democrats,'' Mr. Lott said.
At the same time, Mr. Fleischer said, Mr. Bush is ''open-minded about possible other ideas.''
Today, at Justina Elementary School in Jacksonville, Fla., Mr. Bush repeated his plea for the Senate to take up his education initiative, highlighting $900 million in new money for reading programs.
He gave no hint of backing off on that financing, or anything else in his budget plan.
''One of my dreams is to make sure that schools understand and have the resources available for schools within schools,'' he said.

The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, hinted in an interview that he would be willing to consider using Social Security money to address the economic slowdown if Republicans were willing to scale back some elements of Mr. Bush's 10-year tax cut.
In the interview, Mr. Conrad said Congress's response to the weakening economy should be ''more fiscal stimulus in the short run, more fiscal discipline in the long run.''
''What we really have to keep our eye on here is the economy,'' he said.
''The critical thing is that you have fiscal discipline over time, that you're not taking Social Security and Medicare payroll tax money for other purposes over time.''

In the short run, Mr Conrad said, more fiscal stimulus could be critical to keeping the economy from worsening.
The details, he said, ''could be worked out with Republicans.''
Mr. Conrad's views are not widely shared among Democrats.
Tonight, a senior aide to Mr. Daschle was cool to Mr. Conrad's idea, saying, ''Senator Daschle opposes using the Social Security surplus and believes that since the president rejected our budget approach and our short-term stimulus approach earlier this year, it is his responsibility to come forward with a plan.''
''We'll send it over to the Senate,'' said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, referring to the spending-cut legislation.
''If Daschle is really worried about it, he can pick it up and pass it.''

But Mr. Conrad's views are similar to the position taken by Mr. Bush, who has said he would consider using Social Security money if the economy lapsed into recession.
The flurry of tax plans and economic prescriptions come as Republicans in Congress are expressing frustration that Mr. Bush is not addressing the slowdown forcefully enough.
Some Republicans are drawing a comparison to the midterm elections of 1982 when President Ronald Reagan told the nation to ''stay the course'' in a recession.
Support for Congressional Republicans is slipping as next year's election approaches, the survey found.
Particularly worrisome to the Republicans was evidence that voters ages 55 to 64 were defecting from the party in large numbers, because of declines in the value of 401(k) plans that many people are counting on to finance their retirements.
Then a string of Republicans rose to express frustration with the economy, and in some cases irritation with Mr. Bush's long vacation in Texas.
''We're talking to our members,'' he said.
''We're listening, and we're doing some thinking ourselves.''

But Congressional Republicans continued to describe Mr. Bush and themselves as on different political timetables for 2002 and 2004; they said they could not afford to wait to take action on the economy and the budget situation.
Those developments, if they continued, could ripple into the economy at a time when the United States -- and much of the rest of the world -- appears to be teetering on the brink of recession.
''This couldn't have come at a worse time from an economic point of view,'' said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, the research organization.
No one knows how the markets and the economy might react to the worst terrorist attack in the nation's history.
Much could depend on how the markets respond when they eventually open.
Dave Skidmore, a spokesman for the Fed, said that Mr. Greenspan is ''working and in communication'' with the vice chairman Roger W. Ferguson Jr. and other officials.
Treasury officials said Mr. O'Neill would remain in Japan ''until further notice.''
Late in the day, they issued a statement in his name saying: ''Our nation's financial markets are strong and resilient.
In the face of today's tragedy, the financial system functioned extraordinarily well, and I have every confidence that it will continue to do so in the days ahead.''

Beyond any short-term response to market conditions, government officials confronted the likelihood that various policies would have to be revisited.
Should the economy weaken further, Congress would be more likely to put aside the bipartisan pledge not to touch any of the Social Security surplus and to use some of that money to stimulate the economy through further tax cuts.
While most of official Washington was evacuating its offices, senior officials activated an interagency committee that is formed whenever there is a crisis.
The group, an outgrowth of the stock crash of 1987, is known as the President's Working Group on Financial Markets.
It consists of officials from the Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Members of the group spent the day juggling calls from trading exchanges and investment houses, and from other regulators concerned about the effects of the day's events.
They also consulted with foreign markets which could become particularly volatile in the coming days.

In Switzerland, Mr. McDonough, who oversees the Fed's monitoring of the financial markets, spoke by phone with Wim Duisenberg, the head of the European Central Bank, and held 10 phone conversations with regulators in Washington and New York.
''It is clear that the normal financial system in the U.S. has held up extraordinarily well,'' he said.
''I think the central banking apparatus and the market apparatus knows how to function.''
Would the day's events shatter confidence in an already shaky market and lead to unacceptably volatile trading?
Did the system have enough liquidity in the form of easy credit to assure that major houses would not buckle?
And how would Wall Street be able to cope with the devastating destruction of the World Trade Center, which houses many crucial market players, including some offices of Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank.
By midday it became clear, officials said, that the stock and futures exchanges would need at least a second day to adjust, absorb the tragedy and assess when they might be ready to reopen.
''The markets do best when there is a free flow of information and people are fully informed,'' said Harvey Pitt, the new chairman of the S.E.C.. ''One of the difficulties is that what happened just occurred.
And if one wants people to make decisions that are based on all the information that's important.''
''In a free market we do not want to unduly tie up the right of people to trade,'' he said.
''But at a minimum, because of the tragedy and for regulatory reasons, it makes sense for people to take a step back and reach conclusions about the market.
While I would not dictate to the markets what they should do, there is a consensus that tomorrow it would be inappropriate to trade.''

Mr. Pitt said that his conversations with the exchanges and investment houses made it clear that ''notwithstanding the incredible amount of damage, there are a variety of fail-safe mechanisms,'' like backup record-keeping operations, that will enable trading to resume.
He said that on Wednesday, the exchanges -- in consultation with their members and with Washington officials -- would reassess when the markets should reopen.
Officials were only beginning to grapple with the long-term consequences.
The mayor of Washington, Anthony A. Williams, said he was considering asking the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to postpone their annual meetings later this month.
''You want to have a normally functioning market, a normal environment,'' said Steve Oristaglio, an executive with Putnam Investments.
Waiting until the market is certain to be completely functional ''would ultimately be healthier,'' he said.
''Nobody in America has ever seen anything like this,'' the executive said.
''If workers do come back in to work and see this, there aren't enough psychiatrists in New York to deal with it.''
David Schultz of Summit Capital Management in Virginia said, ''People are hoping they don't open the markets for at least a few more days.''
But they stabilized in Europe yesterday, leading to hopes that the damage to prices will be limited when New York trading resumes.
Verizon, the primary telephone company in Manhattan, said yesterday that 80 percent of the circuits used for voice and and data communications at the New York Stock Exchange may be out of operation because of problems with power supplies to one Verizon operation.
Verizon officials will meet with financial officials today to assess the problems and possible ways to increase service quickly.
Harvey Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he was not worried about a delay reducing investor confidence: ''I'm confident that if the rationale for delay in opening the equity markets is to give them a greater sense of comfort, most people will react positively to that.
They should have confidence that the markets will be exactly as they were.''
''Our first responsibility is to find those who are alive,'' he said.
Contingency plans have been drawn up to allow options traders at the Amex to move to options exchanges in other cities, and stock traders to use the floor of the Big Board.
Earlier, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that the city was prepared to do everything it could to allow the markets to reopen today, including providing police escorts and cleaning up the area.
''It's going to be difficult,'' he said.
''but I believe we can do it.''
When trading does resume, Mr. Grasso said, security will be substantially increased.
The exchange already required visitors to pass through an airport-style metal detector.
All bonds, from corporates to Treasuries, will resume trading today.
But the most attention will be on the Treasury market.
''We will persevere,'' said Howard W. Lutnick, the chairman of Cantor, at a meeting with relatives of missing Cantor employees at a Manhattan hotel last night.
He said the firm's operations in London and New Jersey would enable its electronic trading system to operate.

The Treasury market has long been a haven for worried investors from around the world, and there could be a rush of buying when trading reopens.
Perhaps more important, that market is critical to the functioning of the nation's banking system and to the monetary policy operations of the Federal Reserve.
For example, lowering the Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate, which some analysts expect the central bank to do in an effort to stabilize financial markets, means the Treasury market has to be open.
Traders and executives at firms involved in the Treasury market said yesterday that they were confident that the market would function well, although there might be some glitches and some adjustments in how trading is done to ease the strain on the system.

''It will be a little bit more difficult but it will function fine,'' said James R. Capra, president of Capra Asset Management in Rye, N.Y., and chairman of a committee that advises the Treasury Department on managing the nation's debt.
But traders said that there would be less volume than normal because many dealers at the core of the market would be more cautious as they adjust to the post-attack environment.
Some of them will be using contingency sites and there will be some firms absent that are usually involed in trading.
Some traders said they would also try to limit the amount of trading.
All of this could make the market more volatile than usual.
The fixed-income industry, along with government officials, worked out a way to open the bond market for trading today in a series of telephone conference meetings yesterday.
The bond market will open at 8 a.m. and close early, at 2 p.m. Then officials will meet again to decide if the bond market will be open tomorrow, according to the Bond Market Association, which is the industry association.
The main issue that the bond market faces, according to the people who were involved in the conference call, was the settlement of trades.
Settlement assures that the money and securities involved in a trade go to the right parties promptly.
In the Treasury market, settlement generally comes one trading day after the transaction.
But because of the strain on the systems for settling, which is done by clearing banks, it was agreed that trades done today and tomorrow would be settled in three days.
Marc Shapiro, vice chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase, said the bank's clearing operation, one of the main ones for the fixed-income market, was ''working remarkably well, considering the circumstances.''
He said that there was still a lot of manual handling of trades being done, so that ''we are stretching settlements into the night.''

Cantor's electronic system handles a large volume of trades in Treasuries, although there are competing systems.
And when he is doing a trade, he said ''my dealers will always match the Cantor price because they know I am watching the Cantor price.''
But Mr. Capra and other traders said that there were alternatives that could provide enough market transparency, although it would not be as good.
One is BrokerTec.
It is an electronic broker that is owned by the major primary dealers.
Hal Hinkle, the chief executive of BrokerTec, said that ''we're operationally ready and we expect to be open to serve the needs of the dealer community.''
Another broker, Liberty, was also expected to be open assuming its traders could get to their downtown offices.
There is also concern about clearing of some stock transactions that were made before the attack.
Most of the company's employees there have been accounted for, according to Calvin Mitchell III, senior vice president at Instinet.
The plunge in interest rates was augmented by a sharp decline in consumer confidence in September, according to a report from the University of Michigan.

The bond market held an abbreviated session, ending at 2 p.m. Trading will resume in Tokyo and London overnight and then continue here today, closing again at 2 p.m.
Some of the inter-dealer brokers, who match buyers and sellers, were not online.
''It's open; it's operating; but no one's heart is really in it,'' said Michael Cloherty, a bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The trading volume in government bonds ''was equivalent to a preholiday trading day,'' said Hal Kinkle, chief executive of BrokerTec, an electronic broker that is owned by the major primary dealers.
Cantor's system, which has a major share of the government market volume, is important for trading and for informing most traders of what the ''right'' price for a Treasury security is at any given time.

''And that is a positive,'' he said.
The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 4.64 percent from 4.72 percent early Tuesday.
Insurance companies were also shunned because of the expected costs of claims that will be coming.
The reopening is scheduled for Monday.
A rate cut then, these traders said, could help stabilize stocks, especially if there is a sharp decline.
But the expectations of a Fed rate cut are clear in the bond market.
At 2.98 percent, the yield on the two-year note is a little more than half a percentage point below the overnight interest rate on loans between banks, which is the Fed's benchmark.
That rate is now 3.5 percent.
The yield on the October futures contract on the federal funds rate is now down to 2.87 percent.
Fed policy makers next meet on Oct. 2, but many analysts expect a rate cut before then.
Charles Parkhurst, the co-head of the United States government bond trading department at Salomon Smith Barney, was running bond trading from an undisclosed backup location in New Jersey with about three-quarters of his traders and staff members.
''It's not going to be back to normal for two or three days,'' this trader said.
The other major activity yesterday, besides investors' seeking haven and betting on a Fed rate cut, was dealers and customers reducing their risk.
As to where interest rates go from here, that depends a lot on how consumers and the economy respond to the terrorist attack.
More economists now expect economic growth to decline in the third quarter because of the shock.
But some are forecasting a rebound and say it is still to early to declare a recession.
In a report yesterday, the economists at J. P. Morgan, led by John Lipsky, wrote that the economy would decline in the third quarter and that financial markets would be more volatile.
''There will not be lasting disruptions to the U.S. economy or its financial system from yesterday's physical destruction,'' the report said.
''A return to normalcy should be evident by next week.
Any lingering harm to the Manhattan economy (which accounts for about 2.5 percent of overall U.S.
G.D.P.)
will be offset by rising public spending on infrastructure and security.''

''There's a lot of risk around what's going to happen on Monday,'' one analyst said.
One exchange will not open its trading floor on Monday.
The American Stock Exchange, a few hundred feet from the World Trade Center site, will resume operations on two rival exchanges.
The Amex's exchange-traded funds will trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Amex stocks will also trade on the Big Board.
Amex options will trade at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
The exchange may reopen later next week.
Underlying the decline in stocks in Europe is a broad sentiment among some economists that the attack delivered a final blow to any hope that the American economy would avoid recession, meaning that European economies would lose their last hope of an upturn from the United States.
''Global growth estimates will have to be cut further,'' Deutsche Bank said in a note to analysts.

Analysts speculated that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates again to bolster the economy.
''The Fed will act sooner rather than later,'' said Jeremy Baldwin of First State Investments, arguing that a rate cut would avoid a ''cataclysm.''
Some investors, however, fear that heightened tensions over the weekend while markets are closed could further damage their investments.
''This sell-off is because no one wants to hold stocks over the weekend,'' said a fund manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Investors retreated to the traditional safety of government bonds, pushing yields sharply lower.
Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 7/32, to 101 14/32.
British Airways relies on premium fares on long-haul flights for much of its profit.
Similarly, shares of luxury goods businesses, which depend partly on buoyant growth and feel-good spending, were also punished today.
''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, nameless unreasoning unjustified terror, which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.''
-- Franklin D. Roosevelt,
March 4, 1933
IN and of itself, the economic impact of the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon last week will be large but not debilitating.
Imagine the long-feared major earthquake on the San Andreas Fault in California, or a storm worse than Hurricane Andrew that plows through downtown Miami or New Orleans.
The toll in lives and property damage could be comparable to what was experienced last week.
The difference would be in peoples' minds.
Such a natural disaster would be seen as beyond the control of any man.
There would not be fury at those responsible for the disaster, nor would there be frustration about the evident difficulty of mounting effective reprisals, as there is now.
As it is, rebuilding from this disaster will provide a needed stimulus for the economy.
Another lift may come from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who many expect to lower interest rates again.

But while belief in Mr. Greenspan's apparent omnipotence buoyed consumer confidence and spending earlier this year, his role has been diminished.
The important decisions now will be made by the political and military leaders.

''Today Europe is getting very concerned that retaliatory action taken by the United States may have a destabilizing effect,'' said Byron Wien, a strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, speaking from Paris on Friday.
If fear of terrorism paralyzes consumers and businesses, then the economy will fall sharply, and the economic impact of this disaster will be far greater than that of even the worst earthquake.
Maintaining confidence that things will not get much worse, while at the same time seeking to hunt down the terrorists, is the difficult challenge facing the president.
At the end of last week there were e-mail messages circulating widely calling on every recipient to buy stock on Monday.
''Can you think of a stronger message we could send to those who would seek to destroy our way of life?''
Well, yes.
The stronger message would be to live our lives as we would have lived them had this never happened, as if we did not fear a repeat.
That would minimize the economic impact of the terrible event last week.
But it would also mean that families would willingly, even eagerly, board jets for California vacations.
If the fear persists, far fewer will be willing to do that.
Risking money on an investment is not the same thing as risking the lives of your children to let them visit Disneyland.
Now, as in 1933, fear can paralyze.
''I understand it's tough right now,'' Mr. Bush said of the nation's economy.

''But the underpinnings for economic growth are there.
We're the greatest entrepreneurial society in the world.
We've got the best farmers and ranchers.
We've got a strong manufacturing base.
But there's a challenge ahead of us, and I'm confident that our business community will rise to the challenge.''
The Dow is now down 24 percent from its peak in January 2000, well into what is considered bear market territory.
The Nasdaq composite index lost 6.8 percent yesterday, piling up a 69 percent loss since its high in March of last year.
Even as traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange were observing two minutes of silence honoring the attack's victims, prices on the Nasdaq, an electronic market with far-flung participants, went into free fall, shedding almost 6 percent of the composite's value.
Moments later, after Big Board traders finished singing ''God Bless America,'' the selling wave spread to the shares listed on their exchange.
''We've taken today to rejoin the U.S. markets with the rest of the world,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
Now we get away from the crisis and the opening to what the economy looks like.
And on that score it's going to be challenging.''
Companies that rely on consumer spending -- such as retailers -- also declined yesterday.
''If you put it into the framework of a crisis, I think the decline is relatively reasonable,'' said Henry Kaufman, a prominent Wall Street economist at Kaufman & Company in New York.
''There have been other periods in which the daily declines have been much larger, and the circumstances were not as extreme.''
Few money managers expect yesterday's decline to be the last of the damage to stock portfolios from the terrorist attacks.
''Despite the fact that the Dow is down 700, the response of the domestic investor has not yet started.''
Alexandra Lebenthal, chief executive of Lebenthal & Company, a brokerage firm specializing in municipal bonds, returned to her office on the 12th floor at 120 Broadway, just two blocks from where the World Trade Center had stood and reminisced about watching the towers go up.

''For all of us who work down there, seeing that jagged structure, that demolition site is a hard reminder of what has happened,'' she said.
''Something else will get built, but we'll always remember the twin towers and what they stood for.''
Investors were urged to prove their patriotism by buying shares of stock; some trading desks reported little to no short-selling of stocks, a bet on falling prices in which investors borrow shares to sell them, hoping to buy them back later more cheaply.
''The scary part is today's market is not a real market,'' one hedge fund manager said.
''The big boys are not playing.
People are pulling strings around the place to keep a sense of normalcy.
I don't know how long that will last.''

''We got one call from a woman who said: 'I'm not panicking.
Don't you.'
''Our shareholders are reacting like true professionals,'' Mr. Olstein said.
''I have seen no panic as in past crises.''
''They want to know what we think is going to happen to the market, what they should be doing with their money, how we think certain funds will fare, should I make changes in my portfolio,'' said Steve Norwitz, a T. Rowe spokesman.
''They want reassurance.''
The Vanguard Group, the nation's second-largest mutual fund company, reported a normal day for transactions but many inquiries from investors monitoring accounts.
These reports indicate that individual investors were not heavy sellers yesterday, giving credence to reports that foreign investors may have played a role in the decline.
It is the largest carrier at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, now closed, and officials have given no indication when it will reopen.
Makers of security gear, many of which are small, lesser-known companies, rocketed.
The dollar declined in value against the euro but it has held up reasonably well since the attack.
The threat of further intervention by Japan and other central banks may help the dollar in the weeks ahead.
Against the euro, the dollar was at 92.44 cents, down 0.8 percent; it is down 2.9 percent against the euro since the attack.
The dollar rose to 117.73 yen, up from 117.29, but is off 2.7 percent since the attack.
Investors faced with political and economic uncertainty usually take refuge in Treasury securities.
The price of the 10-year note declined, pushing its yield up to 4.62 percent from 4.55 percent Friday.
Investors still expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate a quarter of a percentage point when it meets again on Oct. 2, Mr. Lipsky said.
But market rates may already reflect that expected move, which means they may not fall much further in the weeks ahead if there are no other political or economic surprises.
Thomas Sowanick, chief global debt strategist at Merrill Lynch, said that some of the selling might also be coming from investors who are worried that the cumulative effect of the Fed's eight rate cuts this year and the large amount of cash the Fed has pumped into the financial system since the attack will add to inflation pressures when the economy does turn around.
With the first day of trading under their belts, investors began to wonder what the rest of the week would bring.
Mr. Kral, the portfolio manager, said: ''The market is acting with a great deal of grace.
But divining the long-term winners and losers will be very difficult.''
''Having Europe end 3 percent higher on the day is encouraging,'' he said.
Yesterday, they staged mild recoveries in the morning but gave up those gains in the afternoon, in part because hopes seemed to be fading for concessions from Afghanistan on surrendering Osama bin Laden, whom Washington has identified as the prime suspect in the attacks.

In trading around the world, Asian markets generally moved up yesterday as central banks in Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong joined the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in cutting interest rates to try to support the world economy.
While American stocks generally avoided large declines yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 17.30 points, to 8,903.40, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipping 6.03 points, to 1,032.74, the situation was worse in the Nasdaq stock market.
All three indexes are at their lowest levels since late 1998.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange settled back to nearly 1.7 billion shares after setting a record by trading almost 2.4 billion shares on Monday.
Some analysts found more disturbing the trends in two other markets, bonds and currencies.
The weakness in the bond market represents an abrupt change from the market reaction late last week, when bond trading resumed.
The lure of safety has not vanished, but traders are coming to realize that there will be far more Treasuries than they had expected.
''Last week completely changed the budget picture,'' said Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research in Princeton, N.J., noting that the government will be spending far more money than had been expected, both to rebuild Lower Manhattan and the Pentagon and for military expenditures.

Rising bond rates, if that trend continues, would work against the Federal Reserve's effort to stimulate the economy through lower interest rates.
The Fed can directly affect short-term rates, but long-term rates determine how much corporations pay when they borrow in the bond market or how much individuals pay for mortgage loans.
Since the terrorist attack, the dollar is off 3.1 percent against both currencies.

Since the dollar peaked earlier this year, it has lost 7.5 percent of its value against the yen and 9.7 percent against the euro.
The reversal could be a sign that investors are seeking another form of safety, that of keeping more of their money close to home.
Because the United States runs a huge trade deficit, it requires a constant infusion of investments from abroad to balance the international accounts.
''The weakening dollar suggests there may be a loss of appetite for dollar-denominated investments,'' said Douglas R. Cliggott, chief equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Chase.
Within the stock market, the trend of investment sentiment has been at least partly obscured since trading began Monday because of two unusual factors.
The first was the patriotic pleas to buy stock, which appear to have led to substantial buying by individuals on Monday morning but have had less effect since then.
Numerous companies have announced plans for buybacks, and some have said they did so.
Stock buybacks were a prominent source of strength in the bull market of the 1990's, but the level has fallen drastically in recent months as corporate profits have deteriorated.
Some companies that are buying back stock now may not, in fact, feel comfortable spending the money.

''I've never seen a company buy stock in the market and turn around and immediately offer it to the public,'' said Mr. McManus of Banc of America Securities.

Many stocks that depend on a relatively strong economy also recovered somewhat, with Caterpillar up $1.02, to $45.71, and the DuPont Company gaining 91 cents, to $35.36.
But some companies that seem likely to be directly affected by a widely expected slowdown in tourism and air travel continued to fall.
Within the bond market, shorter-term securities, like two-year notes, have held up well.
But longer-term securities have done less well.
The 30-year bond has been especially hard hit because many investors thought it would be retired soon, which made paying a little premium to own these bonds worthwhile.
But now that is unlikely any time soon.
The yield on 30-year bonds has climbed to 5.44 percent, higher than it was before the attack.
The price of crude oil dropped 3.9 percent as the prospect of a global recession means that oil consumption will decline, easing pressure on prices.
Following the lead of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the central banks of England and Japan and others, the monetary authorities of South Korea and New Zealand lowered their benchmark short-term interest rates yesterday, joining in a worldwide effort to forestall recession and reassure financial markets after the terror attacks in the United States last week.
Chon Chol Hwan, the bank's governor, said the main motive for the reduction was to reduce the shock of last week's events on an economy already slowing drastically because of widening slumps in the two largest markets for Korean products, Japan and the United States.
In Wellington, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand also made a half-point move, reducing its benchmark overnight cash rate target to 5.25 percent, ''primarily because of recent tragic events in the United States'' and the threat that a global economic slowdown would worsen in their aftermath, according to the bank's governor, Don Brash.
''We know that there is a combination of infrastructure problems and technical and physical breakdowns that have occurred,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
''Until we can see what the economy looks like without them, appropriate policy measures, in my judgment, are premature.''

But members of the committee made clear that they are under pressure from constituents to provide some economic help to deal with the effects of the attacks, including announcements of large-scale layoffs.
In addition to the airline industry, they said, insurers, small businesses, the auto industry and even taxi services are suffering.
Mr. O'Neill expressed sympathy with businesses that are being squeezed and workers who are losing jobs, and he said the administration would move quickly to provide financial help to the airlines.
If necessary, he said, the government could address consumer, investor and business confidence through some type of a broadly aimed fiscal stimulus plan.
The government, he said, should ''make sure we're not treating secondary or tertiary consequences, but we're fixing the hole in the system that will make everything else work.''
Responding to concern from Democrats that the administration and Republicans in Congress might use the crisis to push through politically controversial proposals like a cut in the capital gains tax, Mr. O'Neill said the White House would resist adopting ''off-the-shelf political things that have been paraded around.''
But he said that consumers seemed to be in good shape and that the underlying economic challenge was one of helping to increase the market valuation of companies by helping them increase their free cash flows -- money that does not have to go to debt repayment, operating expenses or taxes.

The solution, he said, might be ''to reduce the pressure that companies have from paying taxes,'' an apparent reference to his longstanding call for reducing or eliminating corporate income taxes.
Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said at the hearing that his agency would propose making it easier for small businesses to raise money in the markets by streamlining paperwork requirements.

Rushing in the days after the terrorist attacks, Congress pushed through a $40 billion emergency spending package and began considering additional proposals to bolster the economy.
Among them were cutting the capital gains tax, cutting taxes in a way that would benefit low-income people who did not qualify for this summer's rebate checks, expanding the unemployment insurance program and spending heavily on reconstruction programs.
But with Mr. Greenspan cautioning against moving too quickly, Congress and the administration have put the issue on hold for a week or two, despite the falling stock market and the rising toll of layoffs.
''I think the better judgment is to not move right now, to give it a few weeks to get better information on exactly what is happening,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic minority leader in the House.
''I don't know what it will include.
There's no way to do that today.''
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said the United States should press ahead with a new round of talks on dropping trade barriers around the world, a step that he said ''would not only significantly enhance world economic growth but also answer terrorism with a firm reaffirmation of our commitment to open and free societies.''
The economy all but stalled during the spring, and economists have been marking down their forecasts for the second half of the year in the wake of the attacks.
A survey released today by Blue Chip Economic Indicators found that most economists believe that the nation has entered a recession, which is generally defined as two consecutive quarters in which total economic output declines.
Mr. Greenspan said that before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the economy had been showing signs of emerging from its yearlong slowdown.
The attacks, he said, would no doubt ''have significant effects on the U.S. economy over the short term.''
One risk to the outlook, Mr. Greenspan said, would be if long-term interest rates shot up in response to concern among bond market investors that the government would not be able to pay down the national debt.
Among other things, he said, the economy has benefited this year from the ability of homeowners to refinance their mortgages at lower rates, allowing them in many cases to take equity out of their homes in cash to use for other purposes.
In that way, he said, low mortgage rates have helped offset the squeeze on household finances from falling stock prices.

Wrightson is coping with its own crisis by working to get the business back up.
But Mr. Crandall sees a difficult time ahead for forecasters and, therefore, investors -- and not just because the immediate outlook is grim.

The attack on the world's financial capital, he said, has pushed the economy into unpredictable territory, rendering it nearly impossible to make intelligent use of the economic data for September and October and, maybe, even later in the year.
So even if he were publishing now, his stodgy computer-driven spreadsheets and 20 years of annotated notes on Federal Reserve policy meetings (all of which were lost) would be of little help and his routine of predicting economic indicators would be upset.
Speaking of forecasters, he said, ''We have less value because we don't know what the numbers ought to say right now.''
He added, ''In this extraordinary emotional state, you can't draw many conclusions about what this particular number means about the broader economy and about trends going forward.''
The uncertainty will make stock and bond markets more volatile and hazarding reasonable guesses about the future very difficult.
Even how the financial markets would respond to an attack on the terrorists who did this is uncertain.
''The emotion of the tragedy will affect the numbers, but we don't know how,'' he said in an interview a week and a day after the tragedy.
''Then that initial response will change, and so will the impact on the numbers.''
Mr. Crandall has no choice but to change.
It may not sound like much, but the loss of his antiquated spreadsheets and other forecasting tools will give Wrightson the opportunity to rebuild them in a much more useful form.
He will review the format of his weekly newsletter and his daily online service.
He will add real-time bond and money market prices to the Wrightson Web site.

''This is getting a lot of people out of their ruts.''
Such reassessments are being made around the country.
''This does force a lot of people to think about how we are doing things, and once you do that, you think of things more than those related to the World Trade Center,'' said Richard F. Syron, chairman and chief executive of the Thermo Electron Corporation in Waltham, Mass.
''You think of things you would not have thought of before,'' like smoothing out the company's shipment schedules.
IN the long run, these retoolings and refinements of businesses could help the economy by improving productivity and cutting costs.
''Obviously, there are huge temporary short-term negatives and long-term negatives from this,'' Mr. Crandall said.
''But in cold-blooded economic terms, this is one of the positives.''
In the near term, the economic outlook is grim, which means third- and fourth-quarter corporate earnings will be down even more than expected two weeks ago.
''If we are lucky, were are back to a V'' pattern for the economy, he said.
The V pattern is based on the idea that the shock from the tragedy will send economic growth plunging as consumers stop spending and production is disrupted.
But if those interruptions are temporary, the stage will be set for a sharp rebound, completing the second leg of the V, when the expected huge increases in government spending, and possibly more tax cuts, kick in.
Then the rally part of the V could give stocks a lift.
As for interest rates, an end to the economic decline would probably send them higher, especially at the short end.
As of now, Mr. Crandall has no vehicle for distributing his views.
He received new laptop computers on Friday and hopes to begin producing the weekly Money Market Observer sometime this week.
While some people are working from home, Mr. Crandall and other of his colleagues are in a temporary office on Fifth Avenue, at 47th Street, at a company called Numerix, a partner with ICAP, the money and bond market broker that owns Wrightson.
(ICAP was also in 1 World Trade Center and is now operating from temporary offices in Manhattan and New Jersey.)

Because he doesn't think that he and other forecasters will be able to say much that is constructive about economic data for several months, Mr. Crandall will spend his time examining the outlook for the Treasury market as the government surplus shrinks and maybe disappears.
But he is still itching to print the next guess on what the unemployment rate will be in September and how many jobs will be lost.
''Who am I kidding?''
''I have been forecasting the monthly unemployment rate for a couple of decades now.
When I see the calendar getting to the end of the month, I cannot avoid looking at that.''
For decades, the economy of Columbia has been unusually resilient.
Driven by its colleges and universities, its hospitals and insurance companies, it tends to resist the worst of the booms and busts that plague layoff-prone manufacturing towns.
For years, it has had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, rarely exceeding 2 percent.

But last week, even Columbia started showing signs of tumbling into a recession.
People are buying what they need, they say, but little of what they once wanted.
They are shredding their prosperity-nurtured plans for bigger homes, bigger cars, new appliances and a higher standard of living.
They have stopped applying for credit cards.
As Columbia goes, so, almost certainly, most of the nation is going.
To declare a recession, the government requires six months' evidence of reduced consumer and business spending, and that has yet to show up.
But within the banking system, evidence is building that consumers are acting on their post-attack sentiments and scripting a recession.
Thirty miles south of Columbia, in the state capital, Jefferson City, is the Midwest Independent Bank.
It is what is known as a bankers' bank, or a correspondent bank.
It has no tellers or A.T.M.'s.
Its purpose is to provide financial services to more than 300 mostly small banks in Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa.
By watching the loans and transfers the banks make to one another each day, Midwest Independent can spot signs of a surging or chilling economy almost instantly.
It can tell when the customers of other banks start to retreat from stores, fall behind on credit card payments or stop applying for loans.
Nearly two weeks after the terrorist attacks, Camden R. Fine, the bank's president, sees an already slowing economy slowing even more.
''Everything has changed,'' said Mr. Fine, who also owns a small bank in Ashland, between Columbia and Jefferson City.
Now you have loan demand slowing.
People are more cautious about withdrawing money, and they're adding to their deposits.''
Consumers appear to be shunning anything frivolous.
Near Columbia, at the Kingdom City exit off Interstate 70, sales at the barnlike Ozarkland souvenir store have stalled.
''People are sad,'' said Sharon Brown, assistant manager.
In Columbia, at Starrett Fine Jewelers on Broadway, Michael Oetting, the manager, said: ''Standard bridal and anniversary jewelry, they're back to normal.
Spontaneous purchases, they're not.''

At Summit Travel on Broadway, Jerry Price, president, has cut his five agents' hours by 20 percent.
''The phones have been very quiet,'' he said.
''It causes us to be wary about our future.''

Mr. Price's travails echo across the economy, in his agents' diminished incomes and in spending for supplies and services that he has curbed.
''For a small-business person,'' he said, ''this is a crisis.''
Home sales, too, have plunged.
''It's the middle class that's getting squished the most,'' she said.
She said some of the more expensive houses, those priced at more than $200,000, are selling because wealthier buyers have cash, and homes for less than $90,000 are selling because low-income buyers can get government-subsidized mortgages.
He is in the construction business, specializing in building the concrete foundations for the forests of subdivisions that have grown up around Columbia.
Like many people here, he says he believes that burrowing in is what the terrorists want.
''I'm not going to stop going on living and enjoying life, or the terrorists have won,'' Mr. Gravitt said.
But like many people, too, he is making compromises.
''I take hunting and fishing trips to Colorado and South Dakota,'' he said.
''But I'm going to stay around home and stick with the family.''
With fewer consumers taking money out of banks for loans and spending, Mr. Fine at the Midwest Independent Bank says an immense sea of money is sloshing around in bank coffers.
Part of the reason is that at the same time consumers and businesses have been borrowing less and saving more, the Federal Reserve in Washington has been pouring money into the economy to thwart fearful consumers' runs on banks and assure that when they do want to borrow, they can get the money.

By Wednesday last week, M.I.B.
banks that normally borrow from one another to keep their accounts balanced stopped lending and borrowing altogether.
As a result, they chopped the interest rate they charge one another from 3 percent to zero.
''They're sitting with excess funds, and they can't find anybody to buy them,'' Mr. Fine said.
''I've never seen zero.
That's unprecedented.''
Once it becomes clear that the rock-bottom rates are here to stay, the same banks can be expected to cut rates throughout the economy, reducing them on credit cards, car loans and home mortgages.
Precedent shows that low rates can eventually reignite the economy.
But on Friday, General Motors dealers began offering five-year car loans for no interest at all to reliable buyers.
Such deals might revive consumers.
''I have a friend in Bolivar, Mo., who has a G.M.
dealership,'' said Doug Collins, 48, a cable splicer for Verizon who drives a 1996 Chevrolet truck.
''I'm going to see if what I heard is true,'' he said.
''I might buy a new truck.''
The Swiss National Bank cut interest rates for the second time in seven days to tamp down the Swiss franc, which has soared against the dollar, the euro and the British pound.
The Swiss economy is expected to grow 1.8 percent this year.

The main reason for the spate of cancellations is ''fear, straight simple fear fed by newspaper headlines in Europe and Asia that were describing New York as a war zone,'' Mr. Browning said.

Three Arab performers have postponed their performances, said their promoter, Steve Weitzman.
But their tour has been postponed until Feb. 8.
''They want to come back when there is less anti-Arab sentiment,'' Mr. Weitzman said.
Simon Shaheen, a well-known Palestinian jazz-fusion musician, and his orchestra, Qantara, have postponed an Oct. 5 concert at Town Hall until Dec. 8.
Sluggish ticket sales to performances of the Gypsy Caravan 2 at City Center on Oct. 12 and 13 may force a cancellation of one of the shows, Mr. Browning said.
The 30 performers from India, Spain, Macedonia and Romania are prepared to come, but only 60 tickets have been sold.
Logistical complications caused by the terrorist attacks have also prompted some groups to cancel or postpone coveted New York gigs.

''It is not because we are afraid, or that we don't love New York,'' said Duane Schulthess, artistic director of the Intergalactic Contemporary Ensemble from Minneapolis, made up of 25 musicians who were due to perform ''I Dig,'' a concert of film-noir soundtracks in the Miller Theater at Columbia University on Nov. 9.
Rather, the group canceled because of a change in airline schedules that cost them a free stopover in New York on their way to a concert in London.
The New York premiere of ''Blood on the Floor'' (named after a painting by Francis Bacon), composed by the British composer Mark-Anthony Turnage and performed by Kristjan Jarvi's Absolute Ensemble of New York, is going ahead as planned on Friday and Saturday.

''The Lowest Show on Earth,'' a monthlong one-man show by the Canadian comedian Scott Thompson, who was originally with the ''Kids in the Hall'' comedy group, has been cancelled at the 45 Bleecker Theater in Greenwich Village.
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, the rock band whose members mostly live in Europe, have indefinitely postponed their concerts for Oct. 4 and 5 at the Beacon Theater, said David Viecelli of the Billions Corporation, which is the band's agent.
''Everything the president said has indicated some kind of military action, and the members of the band didn't want to be away from their families.''
''You can't reason with that.''
The claims will ''put severe pressure on many of the weaker operating units'' within the Lloyd's market of 108 syndicates, according to a statement by Moody's Investor Services.
The syndicates variously compete and cooperate with one another to write mainly specialist aviation, property and other insurance contracts.
But in contrast to a decade ago, when a series of catastrophic and health-claim losses pushed Lloyd's to near collapse, now, the exchange says, its asset base of $27 billion can take the strain.
''While a figure of this size will have a significant impact on the Lloyd's market, the market's strong capital base will absorb this loss,'' the chairman of Lloyd's, Sax Riley, said.
''The size of our asset base, the spread of the losses and the resilience of the reinsurance programs in place are important in coming to this conclusion.''
The only single insurer to forecast a larger exposure to claims relating to the attacks is Berkshire Hathaway, which estimated payouts at $2.2 billion.
Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world's two largest reinsurers -- companies that underwrite the losses of other insurers -- last week increased their estimates of losses from the attacks to a combined $3.2 billion.
Some executives and analysts have said that total claims might exceed $70 billion.

Since Sept. 11, Lloyd's had avoided offering an estimate of its likely losses while insisting that changes it put in place in the mid-1990's would protect it from the upheavals of 10 years ago.
The changes reduced the number of ''names'' -- rich people who put up their personal fortunes to back policies written by Lloyd's syndicates -- to about 2,800 from around 30,000 in the 1980's.
Underwriting losses pushed many names into bankruptcy in the early 1990's.
About 80 percent of Lloyd's capital is now provided by almost 900 companies.
Still, the claims from the terrorist attacks in America -- Lloyd's biggest market -- come as Lloyd's struggles with losses caused in part by long-running asbestos-related health claims in the United States that have cost it an estimated $560 million every year for the last decade.
Equitas, a reinsurance company formed by Lloyd's, estimates that asbestos-related claims will cost an additional $11.8 billion.

''Clearly there will be a contraction in global insurance capacity which will fuel the premium rate rises we've been seeing since the last quarter of 2000,'' Mr. Riley, the chairman, said.
It remains unclear, however, how well individual investors at Lloyd's will weather the crisis.
The market's $27 billion asset base includes a central fund, currently $471 million, intended to support its member syndicates' ability to pay claims.
Lloyd's can ask the member syndicates to contribute an additional $435 million, and the fund is protected by reinsurance contracts.
It said today that it would ''inevitably'' demand that some syndicates provide additional money to pay claims.
''At this very early juncture, it is considered unlikely,'' the Moody's statement said, ''that the losses will exceed the central fund's resources, although it is expected they may be severely tested.''
Nicholas Haskins, an analyst with ABN Amro, said it would be ''naïve to say that one or two'' syndicates at Lloyd's would not struggle to meet their commitments.
But, overwhelmingly, he said, companies and investors would ''refund and replenish,'' not just to pay claims from the terrorist attacks but to remain part of the Lloyd's market, which requires members to deposit covering funds up front every year.
''By 2002 there will be greatly increased rates and very much reduced exposure'' as companies shy from high-risk insurance, Mr. Haskins said.
''The risk-reward ratio'' for the companies, he said, ''is looking very good for 2002.''
''Both scenarios are equally realistic,'' Mr. Strube said.

The prime minister of France, Lionel Jospin, went so far as to declare consumer spending tantamount to a civic duty.
''The battle against terrorism is not merely an issue for the judges, the intelligence agencies and the nations,'' Mr. Jospin said in an interview published today in the French newspaper Ouest-France.
''Let us together show economic patriotism.''
In the two weeks since the attacks, European corporations have been racing to revise their plans and prepare for a more prolonged slowdown.
LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's biggest luxury goods group, said just after the attacks that its earnings would be down; similar warnings have since come from Gucci, the Italian fashion designer; Escada, the German producer and retailer of sports and casual clothing; and Leica, the German camera maker.
Most of those warnings stem from fears about slowing sales in the United States.
But European consumers are likely to cut back sharply as well, especially if the slowing economy causes unemployment to rise.
Economists have once again revised downward their forecasts for growth in the 12 nations adopting the euro currency.
A few months ago, many expected growth of 2 percent this year and 2.5 percent or more in 2002; now most expect 1.5 percent or so this year and next.
The spreading gloom has already affected economic policy.
European finance ministers, meeting last week in Belgium, made it clear that many countries would fall short of their goals for deficit reduction this year.
But many economists are convinced that more rate cuts are to come.

Today's warning by BASF provided addition evidence that the fallout from the terrorist attacks is reaching heavy industry as well as consumer spending.
BASF and other chemical companies had already been contending with slumping demand and prices, prompting BASF to shed 2,800 workers.
But BASF said then that it could still increase profit by 10 percent a year.
German machine manufacturers and carmakers are also under pressure.
Germany's association of machine tool manufacturers said today that production would fall 2 percent next year as a result of weak global demand.
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, the world's largest maker of printing presses, warned this week that its sales would come in lower this year than last.
Throughout Europe, many companies had based their optimism on the conviction that the American economy would bounce back quickly.

Escada, the producer and retailer of high-priced casual wear, generates more than 24 percent of its sales in the United States and is still planning to build a store in New York City.
''We cannot yet say whether that is a trend,'' Mr. Ley said on Wednesday, as he discussed the company's third-quarter results.
But, he said, the company has already started to search for ways to cut costs and will probably not meet its goal of increasing sales by 10 percent this year.
Big clouds hang over Germany's luxury car companies as well, especially Porsche, which receives nearly half its profits from the United States.
The big question is whether European consumers will cut back their spending as well.
It is too soon to know if the effects are broad and lasting.
''From what we can tell, I would say the near-term impact is, if anything, less that we had been expecting,'' said Simon Irwin, a retailing analyst at BNP Paribas.
The real effect will depend, he said, on whether unemployment begins to rise, as it has in America.
Reflecting higher local interest rates and a worsening global economic picture after terrorist attacks on the United States, Brazil's central bank lowered the country's economic growth forecast to 2 percent from 2.8 percent for 2001.
Analysts say that lower economic growth will help keep a lid on inflation, which is already expected to exceed the central bank's goal of 6 percent this year.
The government forecasts inflation of 6.5 percent.

The dizzying turnaround, which extends well beyond the stock market, has left Argentines to wonder what has happened to the promised benefits of a globalized economy.
Today the ebullience that accompanied the burst of glittering shopping malls, modern industrial parks and banks flush with money is gone.
Political and social unrest is rising, and perhaps dangerously so.
The shopping centers are now full of going-out-of-business signs.
The banks can barely collect on their loans.
Almost one in five workers is out of a job.
And money is so hard to find that nearly half a million people buy food and clothes in barter clubs.
Things appear to be only growing worse.
People's confidence has eroded further since the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, as the prospect of a global recession looms ever larger.
The economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, publicly admits that his prescriptions -- assorted tariff hikes, tax reforms and subsidies for exporters -- have so far failed.
Opinion polls show approval ratings for President Fernando de la Rúa in the single digits.
The gloom is such that a prominent political talk show recently opened with the question: ''Is this a country committing suicide?''
Public monopolies were replaced by private ones, leaving high utility and transport costs.

Some economists say that pegging the currency to the dollar gave the country a false sense of stability, ending years of hyperinflation but allowing the government to put off hard decisions about cutting spending, fraud and burdensome taxes.
A devaluation during the growth years might have boosted exports by making them cheaper, without doing much harm.
But having delayed the step for a decade, a devaluation now, in the midst of declining revenues, would only cause more bankruptcies and unemployment.
Short on credit, the government has finally begun to reduce spending -- slashing salaries and pensions -- but at a time when the economy needs a stimulus.
Even a new $8 billion bailout announced by the International Monetary Fund in August has not alleviated fears that Argentina might yet default on its $130 billion debt, a concern that has helped send interest rates soaring.

The unfulfilled dreams are all in evidence in Avellaneda, a gritty working-class port city of 350,000 people next door to Buenos Aires where horse-drawn carts are making a comeback among unemployed garbage-pickers, along with strident murals showing Evita Perón mobilizing the masses.

Labor unions have mounted half a dozen national strikes in the last two years.
Candidates on Mr. de la Rúa's coalition ticket in the Oct. 14 congressional elections are running against the government's policies.
In normal times, Ms. Carrió, 44, would probably be a marginal figure.
She wears a giant cross around her neck, tends to finger rosary beads on the campaign stump, and breaks into tears when discussing poverty.
She publicly accuses Mr. Cavallo of money laundering and calls Mr. de la Rúa a mafia accomplice.
But polls show her to be the country's fastest rising politician, and she has mustered the beginnings of a presidential campaign, drawing crowds of cheering supporters at political rallies that more resemble revival meetings.
''And that is an injustice that must be corrected to form a new republic.''
A political backlash is gathering with particular intensity in provinces like Neuquén, where the privatizations of the railroads and the national oil company produced large layoffs.
The governor has so far refused to negotiate, but more towns are threatening to follow suit and throttle natural gas transport to Chile.

In his book, ''Racing the Antelope: What Animals Can Teach Us About Running and Life,'' the biologist Bernd Heinrich said the secretions began as digested prey -- mostly bees -- that adult hornets fed their grubs in communal nests.
The grubs would then regurgitate clear liquid droplets to the adult hornets, who would fly up to 60 miles a day and up to 20 miles an hour while hunting.

Scientists in Tokyo tested the secretions on mice and human students, according to the book, and stated that the juice assisted long distance runners by increasing the ability to metabolize fat and by reducing the buildup of lactic acid.
Heinrich cast doubt on the effectiveness of hornet secretions, saying that flat cola or beer might be a better and more accessible alternative.
''I suspect that the wasp juice contains a very high sugar content and many amino acids (but not more than in honey and meat),'' wrote Heinrich, an ultramarathon runner, who is a professor of biology at the University of Vermont.
''As to the wasps' speed and endurance, bees do even better and they burn more honey.''
Takahashi's willingness and ability to train over great distances is another notable factor.

Her unprecedented speed and curious eating habits will undoubtedly raise suspicions in an international running community that has grown quite skeptical over the years because of the perceived widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs.
The top finishers in yesterday's Berlin Marathon, which was broadcast live in Japan, were to be subjected to both blood and urine tests for the hormone EPO, the synthetic version of which is banned because it boosts an athlete's oxygen-carrying capacity.
For the past four months, Takahashi has been featured in a Japanese magazine's comic strip, ''Daughter of the Wind.''
That is exactly what she was yesterday, running on a world-record pace from the beginning into a slight headwind in conditions that were otherwise perfect -- overcast with temperatures in the upper 50's.

President Bush got more specific yesterday about what he wants to do to help the economy.
It was a promising start, and the administration should now start working with Congress to deliver a stimulus package as quickly as possible.
Under the president's plan, the total stimulus would amount to 1 percent of gross domestic product, enough to give the economy a good shot in the arm.
But its effectiveness will depend on how the relief is delivered.
Mr. Bush listed a range of options yesterday, some of which are much more likely to work than others.
To help businesses the president suggested a range of tax breaks, including temporary tax credits for new investment, accelerated write-offs for spending on buildings and equipment, and a cut in the corporate income tax.
The first of these is the best, since it would directly encourage companies to start spending.
Accelerated write-offs are less precisely targeted.
They would cut the cost of existing assets as well as new ones, and companies' savings might or might not be used for growth.
Of least use is a cut in the corporate income tax, which would have little if any effect on businesses' decisions on investment and employment.
To help consumers, the president suggested extending the duration of cash benefits and health coverage for the unemployed, more tax rebates and accelerating his existing 10-year package of tax cuts.
Extending unemployment benefits is important, particularly for people who lost their jobs as a result of the terrorist attacks.
Those workers probably were not searching for new jobs before Sept. 11, and they will have trouble finding new positions in hard-hit industries like tourism and transportation.
Longer support will give them time to find better matches for their skills.
Tax rebates would certainly give consumers a boost, especially if the rebates went to lower-income Americans whose purchases are most constrained by their earnings.
But accelerating the tax cuts the president has won from Congress makes less sense.
Most of that relief would go to people who are already relatively wealthy, and whose spending decisions are less sensitive to an infusion of extra cash.
The fact that so much of the Bush tax cuts kicks in somewhere in the future is one of the reasons they have not done more to help the economy.
A more important explanation is that they were directed at the wrong people.
Rather than make them happen sooner, Congress should eliminate some of those tax cuts completely, to raise money for more effective stimuli and to reassure the markets that the nation is not plunging into a long series of serious budget deficits.

Balancing tax cuts and spending today with higher revenues in the future will help to ensure stable long-term interest rates, and a quicker recovery for the economy.
CENTRAL PARK MALL.
Caryatids are no help when you're grappling with loss.
Their stony faces stare out, looking over the top of your head, radiating indifference to changing times.
But trees are there right beside you.
And at the Central Park Mall, they spread a protective canopy, as sympathetic in fall and winter as in summer or spring.

The urban park is America's most democratic art form, and Central Park is the supreme example of the genre.
There's no point in picking one favorite spot: abundance is the theme of this artificially organized piece of nature.
A string duet, seated on a bench, was playing Bach.
In the city, it's easy to forget that there is a difference between trees and artificially ripened tomatoes.
Trees have a more organic relationship to seasons.
They are more sensitive to time.
More than metaphors for life, they embody the material substance of birth, growth, aging and death.
Progression and retrogression are transcended in Central Park.
There is no more healing place in this big town.
BAYARD BUILDING.
Louis Sullivan's Bayard Building in the East Village is covered with scaffolding now, but what isn't?
Not only will they never finish New York, they will never stop having to maintain it, in a perpetual ritual of metropolitan recreation.
Looking at the Bayard Building today, you won't recognize this as an example of functionalist design.
The era of strict correspondence between engineering and architecture still lay ahead, and Sullivan has occasionally been described as an American exponent of Art Nouveau.
But following function is not the same as being indistinguishable from it, and Sullivan's organic ornament -- geometrically stylized foliage -- does not contradict his rule.
Rather, it presents it in analogy.
Architecture should relate to structure in the way that the visible part of a tree relates to its roots.
Thus, the Bayard's facade, a grid of projecting vertical terra-cotta moldings and receding horizontal panels, brings to the surface the building's steel frame structure and the primary function it performs: maximum development of a small urban site by thrusting against gravitational force.
The skyscraper, Sullivan maintained, should be ''a proud, soaring thing.''
Angels hover where you would expect them to: just outside the penthouse windows.
Nonetheless, Sullivan's attempt to fashion structure and ornament into an integrated whole lies at the core of many 20th-century classics, including the Seagram Building and Lever House on Park Avenue and the Chase bank branch on Fifth Avenue at 43rd Street.

Sullivan fed into the future, that is to say.
Today, the Bayard Building stands as a reminder that private clients, including developers, were once more eager than the cultural organizations to embrace progressive ideals.
New York Public Library
At the peak of the modern movement, buildings like the New York Public Library were treated as villains, big Old World elephants trampling over the creativity of progressives like Sullivan.
To Lewis Mumford, the civic monuments of the City Beautiful movement represented ''the imperial facade,'' the triumphal arches of robber barons celebrating their exploitation of the nation's human and natural resources.
Time and use have transformed the library into a monument much closer in meaning to its designers' intentions.
It stands as a temple to the life of the mind and to democratic access.
Some conflicts are outgrown rather than resolved.
The library and the Bayard Building represent two responses, of different cultural merit, to the industrial city and the task of shaping a proper image for it.
That city is now a thing of the past.
Today, urban progress is identified with cultural, not mechanical, production.
The Public Library, designed by Carrère & Hastings and completed in 1911, is thus a transitional building, a relic of the industrial city that has taken on richer meaning as a foundation for cultural enterprise.
Love the lions.
George Washington Bridge
The bridge, completed in 1931, symbolizes the eclipse of the City Beautiful ideal.
But it is also an age with a powerful urge toward aesthetic experiment.''
It continued, ''The monumental design in steel provides an eyeful that could hardly be bettered by trying to make steel towers look like stone piers.''
And Le Corbusier described the bridge as ''the only seat of grace in the disordered city,'' adding, ''Here, finally, steel architecture seems to laugh.''
Here, reinforced concrete seems to meditate.
Radio City Music Hall
Strike up the bands!
We must have music in wartime.
Playing it, I naturally imagined myself sitting in the first balcony at Radio City Music Hall, the greatest people palace in New York.
The vision of Mr. Michael performing with the Rockettes dispelled the dark mood.

Restored with great devotion by Hugh Hardy in 1999, the hall is now a reminder that the landmarks preservation movement was initially a progressive force.
It still is, of course, when it focuses on the task of identifying and preserving landmarks.
Unfortunately, the movement has partly mutated into a retrogressive strain that will not be satisfied until every gum wrapper on the sidewalk is cast in bronze and mounted where it fell with a discreet commemorative plaque.
The Music Hall does not fall into the progressive architectural tradition, either.
New York is a city of ''others.''
We have more at stake in reviving the idea of progress.
United Nations Headquarters
''The concept of progress must be rooted in the idea of catastrophe,'' observed Walter Benjamin, the author of ''The Arcades Project'' (Harvard University Press, 2000).
''That things are 'status quo' is the catastrophe.
It is not an ever present possibility but the given in each case.''
A corollary to this thought is that architecture does best when it is in a state of crisis.
Terence Riley, chief curator of the architecture and design department at the Museum of Modern Art, has drawn a parallel between the World Trade Center disaster and the great Chicago fire of 1871.
The fire generated the greatest outburst of architectural creativity in United States urban history, including some of Sullivan's finest work.
Unfortunately, the status quo has already begun to stake its claims on the so-called ''Rebuilding of New York.''
Should historical awareness prevail over backroom influence peddling, our builders will want to look to the United Nations Headquarters as a model to emulate.
They might also want to pick up a copy of George Dudley's excellent book ''A Workshop for Peace'' (Architectural History Foundation/M.I.T.
Press, 1994) for an insider's account of the design process.
In 1947, an international group of architects convened in New York under the supervision of Wallace K. Harrison.
Egos are on display here, but why shouldn't Le Corbusier have displayed his ego?
And egos have a place in the service of high ideals.

New York's provinciality, its indifference to what has been going on in the sphere of urban architecture around the world, has been the status quo for far too long.
The United Nations Headquarters offers the most persuasive example of what can be achieved when business as usual is smashed.
Waterside Plaza
People tend to overlook Waterside Plaza, the social housing project on the East River in the 20's.
Jane Jacobs to the rescue!
Changing taste aside, Waterside is a great urban composition.
Given the budget constraints, they hit their mark.
Like Kahn's Richards Medical Building at the University of Pennsylvania, Waterside recalls the towers of San Gimignano, the walled medieval town in Tuscany.
In place of walls, it has the East River and the F.D.R.
Drive, and this deliberately restricted access is less than fully benign.
Even so, the stark geometry of the design and the dark brick cladding of the buildings are artistically faithful to the urban concept.
It is picturesque and historically informed.
And if you drive along the F.D.R., the curve beneath the towers is awesome.

Lehman College Gymnasium
Sex returned to New York architecture in 1994, with the completion of Rafael Viñoly's design for this campus gymnasium in the Bronx.
Philosophically, Mr. Viñoly is a Stoic, but his architecture reveals the great elegance and poetry of which the Stoics were capable.
This is a low, horizontal building, partly suppressed beneath ground level, at the northern edge of the campus.
The roof and southern wall are made of a single steel arc of metal, punctuated by a clerestory in the middle.
The arc looks almost two-dimensional, like skin.
It resembles a wave, its silvery color reflecting light like water, the original mirror.
Without overt appeal to metaphor, the design projects a vision of taut, athletic bodies merging with or emerging from the sea.
An immense swimming pool, housed just beneath the arc, is the building's grand public space.
Architecture: just do it.
The gym projects a sleek, dynamic image, like the Nike whoosh.
Fortunately, our prudery has receded to the degree that this connotation is nearly discernible once again.
Mr. Viñoly's architecture is astonishingly nude.
High above the pool, exposed curved metal trusses support the roof, an effect mirrored by divers arcing through space.
Rose Center for Earth and Space
New York's millennium gift to itself: a building that forges a link between modern architecture and its Enlightenment roots.
James Stewart Polshek, the Rose Center's architect, actually improves upon Boulée by fashioning the enclosure from glass, its transparency a symbol for the clarity pursued by science.
The building also represents a rare instance of architecture prevailing over the reflex impulse to preserve.
Those who still miss that structure are advised to sneak an Yma Sumac CD into the Rose Center and persuade a guard to play it on the building's extraordinary sound system.
Hudson Hotel
In her book ''Cosmopolitan Culture'' (Atheneum, 1987), Bonnie Menes Kahn writes that a great cosmopolitan city has two hallmarks: tolerance for strangers and intolerance for mediocrity.
Judged by these standards, the Hudson Hotel is all a displaced person could ask for.
First rate design.
Cheap rooms.
And a Babel of foreign tongues as those gathered for Fashion Week hovered around the data bases in the hallways, looking for ways to get home.
I subscribe to a Surrealist rather than a formalist approach to criticism.
This approach means simply that social and psychological interpretation is factored in with formal analysis.
It happens that the Surrealist tradition has resurfaced in contemporary architecture.
The Hudson, which opened a year ago, is one of the few places in town where you can see this development in flower.
Upstairs, the cabinlike rooms are fitted out in the Stoic esthetic of Adolf Loos.
Downstairs, erotic contours materialize in Philippe Starck's designs and Francesco Clemente's painted ceiling.
At a time of aggression, we need to stay in touch with desire.

West 53rd Street
Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, is the demiurge of civilization.
There can be neither continuity nor progress without memory of what came before.
Kings don't mean a thing on West 53rd Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas.
Angels, and memories, rule.
There are two adjacent construction sites on the north side of the street.
In the center, occupying most of the block, construction has just begun on Yoshio Taniguchi's expansion of the Museum of Modern Art.
Just to the west, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien's American Folk Art Museum is nearing completion for a scheduled opening in December.
Already, this is Dream Street.
Neither of these buildings seeks to shock.
Mr. Taniguchi's design is aesthetically more reticent than I would like.
But retrogressive it is not.
The Modern is, above all, a place of memory, including memories of the museum itself and of the pivotal role it has played in elevating the cultural life of New York to international stature.
The Taniguchi design, which builds upon memories of the International Style, should be a fine spot for all us modern Mnemosynes to get together and reminisce about modernities to come.
Progress is New York's folk art.
This is the message I get from the facade of the American Folk Art Museum.
This, too, is an evolutionary, not a revolutionary design; but in the context of recent New York architecture, even evolution is avant-garde.
The striking facade, soon to be clad with metal panels, is not a figurative design.
But Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien acknowledge that the facade's Y-shape form suggests a human hand, an allusion to American craft.
But I choose to see the shape as an angel, a frequent motif in folk art.
It is the hand that makes it possible for humankind to reach skyward, especially when the earth is darkened.
We have seen a great deal of heroism in recent days.
Can we also keep in mind the courage of small firms like Tod Williams Billie Tsien for upholding the progressive tradition against great odds.
Like Olmsted, these architects operate from the position of empathy.
Working in a profession that is still called upon to erect monuments of boomingly hollow authority, Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien represent the higher realm of human scale.

With tax receipts and stock prices falling and interest rates soaring, President Fernando de la Rúa and other senior officials publicly insisted that they would not consider a devaluation under any circumstances.
Mr. de la Rúa said he would continue to stand by the decade-old policy of pegging the value of the peso to the dollar.
Clifford Krauss (NYT)
Post-terror nerves aside, what mainly ails the U.S. economy is too much of a good thing.
During the bubble years businesses overspent on capital equipment; the resulting overhang of excess capacity is a drag on investment, and hence a drag on the economy as a whole.
In time this overhang will be worked off.
Meanwhile, economic policy should encourage other spending to offset the temporary slump in business investment.
Low interest rates, which promote spending on housing and other durable goods, are the main answer.
But it seems inevitable that there will also be a fiscal stimulus package.
That package should include only measures that really will promote spending now, when the economy needs it.
It shouldn't include anything that worsens the long-run budget position more than is necessary, or anything that looks like ''hitchhiking,'' exploiting the short-run difficulties of the economy to pursue unrelated long-run goals.
Unfortunately, the Bush administration has just taken a big step away from those principles.
Until late last week it looked as if much of any stimulus package would consist of increased government spending to rebuild New York, to pay for military operations and to provide unemployment benefits.
This would put money into the economy in a clearly temporary way.
Giving money to lower-income families would also be sensible.
The problem with temporary tax breaks is that you can't be sure people will spend them; in fact, the much-vaunted rebate seems to have gone mainly into the bank rather than the economy.
The chances are better if the money goes to poorer people, whose spending is often constrained by simple lack of cash.

But the big-ticket items in the stimulus proposal sketched out by administration officials on Thursday, and reaffirmed by George W. Bush after a meeting with Congressional hard-liners, are thoroughly wrongheaded -- and they suggest that bipartisanship is over, that we're back to the cynical budget politics of the past.
One key proposal is a permanent new tax break for business investment.
This violates the basic principle that stimulus proposals should be only short-term.
Furthermore, it would probably have only a modest effect on business investment now, when there is excess capacity; but it would increase long-term interest rates, by increasing both future deficits and future business borrowing.
And since long-term interest rates are what matter for housing, on balance this measure might well delay recovery instead of promoting it.

Another key administration proposal is an acceleration of tax cuts for higher income brackets that under current law are not scheduled to happen for several years.
On the face of it this idea seems bizarre: it gives money to precisely the people who are least likely to spend it.
Is this just a case of knee-jerk conservatism, of the belief that tax cuts for the affluent are the answer to all problems?
Alas, no: it's worse than that.
The real reason to accelerate the Bush tax cut is surely to forestall the growing likelihood that part of that tax cut will eventually be rescinded.
Over the last couple of months the long-run budget outlook has darkened dramatically; we've gone from arguments about whether the Social Security surplus would be raided to the prospect of deficits plain and simple as far as the eye can see.
A natural response, once the slowdown is over, would be to cancel some or all of the tax cuts, mainly for upper brackets, that are scheduled to happen in 2004 and beyond.
As a political matter, that will be much harder to do if the cuts have already gone into effect.
And that, surely, is why the administration wants to accelerate the tax cut.
It's being billed as a short-run stimulus proposal, but it's really a case of covert hitchhiking.
To add to the insult, a preliminary analysis of the numbers suggests that fuzzy math is back: the administration appears to be greatly understating the true budget cost of its proposals and pretending that a package that consists overwhelmingly of tax cuts is evenly split between tax cuts and spending.
As far as one can tell, the ultimate shape of the fiscal stimulus package is still fluid.
The package that eventually emerges could be genuinely designed to help the economy, or it could be mainly a vehicle for political opportunism.
Sadly, the latter possibility has just become much more likely.
No one in Albany knows for certain how much tax revenue will be lost because of the attack, but everyone knows that Wall Street and the financial services industry account for a big chunk of the wages earned in the state.

Thousands of those taxpayers are now dead.
At least 30,000 more have been temporarily relocated out of the state, and that number is expected to grow, legislative budget experts say.
The state will most likely lose income taxes from all those relocated taxpayers who do not live in the state.
The stock market has taken a steep plunge since the attack.
Unemployment is creeping up.
Consumer spending has slowed to a crawl.
Carole Stone, the state budget director, estimated last week that the state would lose $1 billion to $3 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending in April, and $2 billion to $6 billion in the next fiscal year.
''Our forecast on the impact of the World Trade Center event is still based on sketchy information,'' she said.
For his part, the governor vowed in the aftermath of the attack to balance this year's budget without raising taxes or laying off workers.
If revenues plummet, as Ms. Stone predicts, however, the governor will have to dip into reserves of about $2.6 billion to avoid layoffs or tax increases this year, she said.
And if revenues drop an additional $6 billion next year, as in the worst case Ms. Stone envisions, the state could face a financial crisis.
One bright spot in this fiscal fog is the federal government's pledge of $20 billion to pay the entire state and city portion of the cost for the cleanup and reconstruction of the World Trade Center.
That means the state may not have to shoulder the gargantuan cost of replacing the buildings, subway and PATH stations and tunnels, and other infrastructure destroyed in the attack, Ms. Stone and legislative leaders said.

But few budget experts doubt that tax revenues are going to be lower than even the governor's conservative projections.
Talk of adding more school aid has ceased for now.
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, has warned schools, local governments and other groups to lower their expectations.
''We know there is going to be a huge hit to the revenues of the state,'' Senator Bruno said.
''We don't know, truly, what the ramifications are, totally and completely, because the story is unfolding.''
The Assembly Democrats recognize that the fiscal and political terrain has shifted under them, but they have been reluctant to surrender in their fight to get more money for school aid, health care and grants for local governments.
''It's clear that the needs are still there, from education to municipal aid,'' the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said.

But much depends on what kinds of expenses the federal government will be willing to absorb, Mr. Silver and Ms. Stone said.
The governor and Legislature have asked that some of the aid flowing from the Federal Emergency Management Agency be used to balance the state and city budgets, as well as for removing debris and rebuilding.
So far, that request has received a cool reception in Congress.
''The real issue is, Is the federal government going to make up some of the revenue losses?''
''The revenue losses are a direct result of terror against the United States of America, so I think the federal government should in all fairness, as part of its disaster relief, provide for those revenue shortfalls.''
To complicate matters, the state's current budget is a jury-rigged affair.
Now the Pataki administration maintains that the stripped-down budget will drive spending up to $84 billion without any new spending or programs, because it lacks the governor's cost-cutting proposals.
Ms. Stone, the state budget director, said that for the moment, the state budget, even with its flaws, is still balanced, with about $2.6 billion in reserve, largely because Mr. Pataki has been adept at building up surpluses over the past five years.
''We all recognize that we are in uncertain times and we are going to have to re-evaluate almost every issue,'' she said.
To the Editor:
Now that the United States has launched military strikes against Afghanistan (front page, Oct. 8), our country has moved into a new and different phase of conflict.
Yet our history teaches that bloodshed leads only to more bloodshed.
We call upon our president and Congress to stop the bombing.
We demand that those who perpetrated this crime against humanity be arrested and brought to justice under the rule of law.
We urge supporters of peace all over this country to tell their representatives in Congress that ''war is not the answer.''
Our grief is not a cry for retaliation.
Terrorism must be stopped at its root cause, not fed by the seeds of vengeance.

Keith Van Horn's first hook shot slid sweetly off his fingers for the Nets' opening score of their preseason.
Kerry Kittles, returning after sitting out a year with knee surgery, drove defiantly through the lane for the Nets' second score.
While Jason Kidd and the rest of the Nets were working through their nerves, playing a ragged game that would lead to a 91-84 loss to the Charlotte Hornets, Kittles and Van Horn were spry and confident from the start before sitting in the fourth quarter.

Home had little warmth in front of a sprinkling of fans at Continental Airlines Arena, seemingly lower than the announced 2,879.
''I feel very confident, very composed with what we're doing and how I fit in,'' he said.
Considering the youth of Nets teammates -- the team has four rookies and the oldest player is 30 -- Van Horn admitted, as he begins his fifth season, he feels like a relative senior citizen.
Mentally, when it comes to looking at some of the guys on the team, I'm ancient.
I've been through so much in this league,'' the power forward said, shaking his head.
Playing with three different head coaches and three point guards, enduring injury and personal uncertainty about his role, Van Horn has nonetheless endured with a franchise struggling through turnover that would age just about anyone.
''But I still feel young at heart.''

He traces his reinvigoration to Kittles and Kidd.
''I look at the whole situation, not only Jason, but with Kerry back, the whole attitude of the team has completely changed.
Because of that, my attitude has been great,'' Van Horn said.
''It's like the Kerry I remember.
I think he's going to have a fantastic season,'' Van Horn said.
Kittles played with the assurance of a veteran and the passion of a rookie tonight, starting for the first time since the end of the 2000 season.
Afterward, he had an ice bag adorning his right knee -- the one that has had four surgeries -- but dismissed the pain.
''It's just sore, that's to be expected,'' Kittles said.
''I'm just excited to be able to help the team.''
In limited minutes, the pair immediately announced they are ready to lead the team again.
Kidd, the captain, in his debut, and the second-year forward Kenyon Martin, had slow starts indicative of their teammates before recovering with strong third quarters.
Hornets center Elden Campbell beat the Nets' new center, Todd MacCulloch, for four consecutive baskets.
Among the rookies, Brandon Armstrong, the No.
Center Jason Collins had 6 points and 4 rebounds before fouling out.
Mrs. Zia, who organized many general strikes in failed attempts to bring down Mrs. Hasina's government in the last five years, has encouraged Mrs. Hasina to take her place as leader of the opposition.

But Mrs. Hasina, who heads the Awami League and is the first Bangladeshi leader to serve a full five-year term as prime minister, boycotted tonight's swearing-in.
She said those elected from her party would boycott Parliament.
Mrs. Hasina's stance threatens more political turbulence.
In the 10 days since the election, more than 40 people have been killed in political violence.
Most victims have been associated with the Awami League, the Dhaka newspaper Daily Star reported today.
Already there are signs that Mrs. Zia's promise to halt lawlessness is running up against the power of local gangs associated with her party.
Bangladesh is plagued by unemployed young men who do the dirty work of political parties at the local level, enforcing calls for strikes, rustling up people for rallies and intimidating opposition voters.
In return, the parties look the other way when the thugs commit crimes.
Now that Mrs. Zia has come to power, people associated with her party have begun taking over extortion operations at bus terminals, truck stops and markets that were worked by the Awami League when it was in power, Bangladeshi newspapers report.

''It was a big relief,'' said Hamida Tarafdar, 62, a widow who lives in Dhaka with her son and daughter-in-law.
''Now I feel we can sleep at night in peace.''
Falan Mia, who runs a grocery, echoed the sentiment.
''It only vindicates that Allah is there,'' he said.
But in the end the arithmetic of coalition politics may have been even more salient than law and order.
In many ways, the Awami League's popularity is not surprising.
During Mrs. Hasina's tenure, the economy has been growing at a healthy rate of 5 to 7 percent a year, poverty and the birthrate have fallen and Bangladesh has become self-sufficient in food production.
But Mrs. Zia overcame Awami's electoral advantage through an alliance with the three other parties, which brought her coalition's portion of the vote to 46 percent.
It is Mrs. Zia's alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami, which wants to turn Bangladesh into a republic ruled by Islamic law, that secular Bangladeshis find most worrisome.
''Jamaat has been a nuisance, but never an electoral power,'' said Gowher Rizvi, a Bangladeshi who leads the Ford Foundation's South Asia office in New Delhi.
''We will see more intolerance, more emphasis on Islamization.
And groups like the Grameen Bank that are involved in women's empowerment will suffer.''
The question is how much power the Jamaat will exercise in the new government, in which it holds two of the 59 ministerial posts.

The election itself was wondrous to behold, say monitors who went out into the field on Oct. 1.
In the last decade, the country has struggled to re-establish a functioning democracy.
''The money will be a lot more forthcoming, especially to front-line states, especially Turkey but also Indonesia and Pakistan,'' said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.

Horst Köhler, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, made clear in a statement last Friday that the I.M.F.
knows how difficult times could be for emerging-market countries and is ready to help.
''The I.M.F.,'' he said, ''is prepared to play its role of providing advice and additional financial support, where necessary, to those members that have (or adopt) suitable policies, as part of a joint international effort to strengthen confidence in the global economy.''
Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Columbia University who specializes in emerging-markets financing, said, ''Washington is looking for the quickest solution to anything.''
Something bad may not happen immediately.
Because investors have been fleeing emerging markets for most of the year, there is no threat of a sudden, destabilizing exit.
And some measures of emerging-market stress are not as high as they have been in the past.
But America's battle against terrorism has added more uncertainty to the outlook.
Many analysts agree that 2002 will be a difficult year for emerging markets.
''I think emerging markets remain vulnerable,'' said Joyce Chang, global head of fixed-income research at J. P. Morgan.
And although there is no imminent threat of default in Argentina or Turkey, she said, ''There are medium-term concerns going into 2002.''
The outlook for the economies and the stock and bond markets in Argentina, Turkey and other emerging-market countries -- from South Korea and Thailand to Brazil and Mexico -- was worsening before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
It has deteriorated since.
From broad barometers to very specific local ones, the signs are not good.
''For all emerging markets, the situation will be harder because of the consequences on trade and tourism and on the level of economic activity worldwide,'' said Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister of Argentina.
The prospect of a global slowdown and, possibly, a recession in the United States, has quickly shifted to the likelihood of a global recession for the first time since the 1970's.

Interest rates in emerging markets, which were already high, have shot higher, although the fall in rates in the United States has provided some relief.
Still, the difference between yields on emerging-market debt worldwide and that of comparable United States Treasury securities is 10 percentage points, the highest in two years.
Commodity prices are falling, which could help some countries, like Brazil, by lowering energy costs.
But many countries depend on revenues from the sale of copper and other commodities to cover government spending, and could be hurt.
Venezuela and Mexico are major oil producers, and Argentina grows wheat.
Mr. Köhler of the I.M.F.
described the impacts on emerging-market countries this way: ''A further softening in the U.S. will significantly affect nearby Latin American and Caribbean countries, and tourism centers will be hard hit.
Emerging-market debtor countries around the world will be affected by the longer period of global risk aversion.
''Emerging Asian countries will feel the impact of lower demand in the industrial countries, adding to the already ailing high-tech sector and weakness in Japanese demand.
Lower demand and commodity prices further cloud the outlook for primary producers, although lower oil prices would be an offset to net fuel importers, which include many of the poorest countries.''
All three needed assistance from the I.M.F.
before Sept. 11.

If one of them has a serious problem, the contagion in the post-attack environment could spread more quickly than in recent episodes.
Argentina is in the most precarious position, even though it is getting $5 billion in new aid from the I.M.F.
Although Argentina is not that dependent on the American consumer, with about 15 percent of its exports going to the United States, the terrorist attacks have made a global recession more likely.
That would hurt Argentina because much of its trade is with Europe and Brazil.
There are parliamentary elections Sunday, and it is not clear if there will be changes in policies afterward.
There has been talk that President Fernando de la Rúa may replace Mr. Cavallo, the economy minister.
But in an interview, Mr. Cavallo said, ''My impression is that President de la Rúa has no intention to ask for my resignation.''
The decline could jeopardize Argentina's effort to cut its federal government deficit to zero by the end of the year.
Ernest W. Brown, head of fixed-income and economics research at Santander Central Hispano Investment Securities, said that Argentina, given the current global slowdown, is likely to get a pass if it misses the zero goal by just a little.

Still, the decline in tax revenue also suggests that the economy, which has already been in a recession for more than three years, is slowing further.
Santander Central Hispano, which had been forecasting that the economy would grow 0.5 percent this year, now says it expects Argentina's output will shrink 2.4 percent.
Such declines in revenue and growth forecasts are worrisome because Mr. Cavallo's strategy has been to try to hold things together until economic growth could solve most of the problems.
But growth is much farther away now.
Argentina has also been unable to avail itself of the additional $3 billion included in the I.M.F.
program to help promote a swap of some of Argentina's existing $132 billion in debt for new debt, a process that would reduce the country's debt burden.
All this means, many analysts say, that Argentina may now be forced to default on its debt or devalue its currency, which is pegged to the dollar, or do both.
''In an ironic way, Argentina is more protected from the problems in the United States than other emerging-market countries,'' said Rafael de la Fuente, head of sovereign strategy for Latin America at BNP Paribas.
''Still, the likelihood is that their problems lead them into some forced debt restructuring.''
Mr. Cavallo said, ''There will be no devaluation and no compulsory restructuring of our debt.''
Brazil's problem is that it has been hurt by the fallout from Argentina.
The Brazilian currency, the real, has plunged to record lows: down 30 percent for the year and off 6 percent since Sept. 11.
At the same time, interest rates have skyrocketed, rising to an overall average of 16.3 percent, making interest payments on the country's debt even more difficult to meet.
It will take a reversal of these two trends, says J. P. Morgan's recent analysis of Brazil, ''to put debt dynamics back on a sustainable footing.''
In addition, foreign capital flows into Brazil are expected to fall sharply, to less than $20 billion this year from $30 billion in 2000.
Over all, the Institute of International Finance projects that capital flows into Latin America will fall to $45 billion this year from $61 billion in 2000.
They are likely to fall again next year, to $43 billion.

Turkey also suffers from capital outflows and needs a large aid package to cover the government budget deficit in 2002, analysts say.
Its currency, the lira, has plummeted 57 percent this year.
Calls for early elections indicate that political risks are increasing.
Turkey's role in the fight against terrorism has shielded it from some of the fallout since Sept. 11 because investors expect the country to get the international help it will need.
Problems in other countries show that even issues unconnected to the attack and the response that is following have been making the outlook for emerging markets worse.
Mexico is struggling with approval of tax reform and if it is put off until a vote in December, Standard & Poor's is expected to delay a decision on whether to raise Mexico's credit rating to investment grade.
Mexico is also vulnerable to the United States recession.
J. P. Morgan notes that ''reforms appear to have taken a back seat'' in South Korea, where, as elsewhere, growth forecasts are being cut.
At The New York Times, a reporter received an envelope containing a powdery white substance, and law enforcement officials were investigating.
With the very organizations that would inform the public of attacks going on alert themselves, even people in places perhaps far down on the terrorists' hit list fretted about bombs, biological warfare or something unimaginable, like the Sept. 11 attacks.

EURO FALLS.
The system, created in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act, pays an average of $230 a week to unemployed Americans who meet its qualifications.
Although the rules vary from state to state, they typically exclude people who do not fit the traditional notion of a laid-off worker -- part-time employees, recently hired low-wage workers and people who quit their jobs or refused a new shift for family reasons.

As a result, because millions of unemployed workers will not qualify for benefits in the first place, many laid-off employees will not be helped by President Bush's proposal to extend payments to a limited pool of those jobless Americans who are eligible.
With the United States probably in its first recession in a decade and companies announcing tens of thousands of layoffs, the gaps in the unemployment safety net could aggravate the downturn, economists say.
People without jobs or unemployment benefits -- even people whose spouses work -- are likely to cut their discretionary spending sharply, as many struggle to pay their rent, meet their debt payments and still have enough money for food and transportation.
''I'm on the edge of being homeless.''
Mr. Johnson was turned down because New York, like most states, determines eligibility based on earnings over a 12-month period that ends a few months before the date a job is lost.
This is supposed to give the state time to gather employment records, but it often excludes people who have worked for less than a year and were previously without a job.
New York is one of nine states that let people like Mr. Johnson reapply and ask that the most recent months be considered, said Betsy McCormack, a spokeswoman for the state labor department.
With each rejection letter, the state includes a form allowing people to make the request.
George E. Pataki has taken steps to help people left jobless because of the attacks, like extending until next month the deadline to apply for disaster-related unemployment benefits.
Still, Mr. Johnson's unexpected rejection, and the difficulties it has caused, is typical of the effect that an increasingly complicated set of rules has had, job counselors said.
''This is a system that defies explanation in so many ways,'' said Jeffrey B. Wenger, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a research group in Washington partly supported by labor unions.

Full-time employees who worked for at least a year before losing their jobs rarely fail to qualify for benefits because of income minimums; most states require people to have earned only a few thousand dollars to be eligible.
But people are rejected for many other reasons.
Some are turned down because they quit their jobs to care for relatives, leaving them ineligible for benefits once they begin looking for work again.
Or because, like many parents of children, they worked part time before being laid off and are again seeking only part-time work.

''There is a big discrimination against part-time people,'' said Richard B. Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard University.
Like full-time employees, part-time workers pay unemployment-insurance tax while they are working, but in most states they do not receive the benefits of that tax when they are unemployed.
Other people, meanwhile, never receive benefits because they do not think it is worth applying or because they do not know they qualify, labor experts said.
In the 1990's, more states eased eligibility rules than tightened them, Mr. Wenger said, helping the percentage of jobless workers getting benefits to increase slightly.
The General Accounting Office report recommended a more significant loosening of the rules so that unemployment insurance could catch up to the changes in the work force.
The report noted, for instance, that over the last five decades many states have begun rejecting people who had quit their jobs for personal reasons even as the percentage of families with two working parents rose sharply.
But proposals to expand unemployment insurance have won little political support because they cost money and could give people less incentive to find a job, economists say.
In fact, Mr. Freeman said, Australia and many European countries, while still more generous, have reduced their benefits in recent years, making their systems more like that of the United States.

This month, President Bush proposed extending benefits by 13 weeks for people who became unemployed after Sept. 11, who live in states where the unemployment rate rises by at least 30 percent and whose benefits expire.
Most states normally allow people to collect for as long as 26 weeks.
The president also asked Congress to give states $3 billion in emergency funds, some of which could be paid to unemployed workers enrolled in job-training classes who are not normally eligible.
''If you want to put money into the economy, put it in the hands of people who are the most desperate,'' said Richard J. DeKaser, the chief economist at the National City Corporation, a bank based in Cleveland.
''People who are unemployed are not going to save money.''
If anything, many without jobs and unemployment benefits find themselves dipping into their savings or cutting back on their spending.
Marjorie Goldstein, who joined US Airways as a flight attendant in March after spending 15 years at home raising three children, lost her job late last month as part of the airline industry's huge cutbacks after the attacks.
Because her husband works, she is not worried about paying the essential bills.
Now, she said, they are likely to cut back.
Mr. McGreevey's propensity for borrowing stands in contrast to his repeated criticism of former Gov.
Christie Whitman for increasing state debt during her two terms.
It also raises the question of whether Mr. McGreevey, if elected, can keep his pledge to reduce state debt at a time when New Jersey is facing a deficit of perhaps $1 billion or more.

Mr. McGreevey defends his record by pointing to the town's current fiscal strength.
''We have a Aa-3 bond rating, top 20 percent in the nation.''
Supporters say he should not be held responsible for the largest sum borrowed during his tenure -- $34 million that they say was mostly used to correct problems left by his predecessor and to adjust to a new fiscal calendar.
They point out that he has paid down nearly as much debt as he incurred.
Still, they agree that Mr. McGreevey's reliance on debt reflects his traditional approach to public finance.
If Mr. Schundler, the Republican, is something of a financial maverick, wheeling and dealing through two terms as mayor of Jersey City, a close examination of Mr. McGreevey's financial record shows that he prefers to play things safe.
Recently Mr. McGreevey started offering tax abatements to corporations willing to move to Woodbridge and clean up polluted property.
''I think Jim McGreevey learned sometimes the less you do, the less things that are going on in town, the less people question,'' Barbara Wyatt, a Woodbridge resident who battled Mr. McGreevey over the demolition of the old Town Hall to make way for a new building.
In public finance, as in nearly everything else, Mr. McGreevey's pre-eminent skills are political, supporters and critics say.
He has artfully used Woodbridge's underlying economic strength to budget with an eye toward his future.
He has never raised taxes in an election year, for example.
At the same time, his close political allies have profited from his spending and hiring decisions.
Throughout this year's campaign, Mr. McGreevey has said that anyone wondering how he will manage state finances need only look at how he ran Woodbridge, the state's fifth-largest municipality.
But he has also preferred to discuss the failings of Mr. Schundler and Jersey City than his own record.
Woodbridge Township, population 97,000, is a suburb at the intersection of the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway.
It is home to the things that define New Jersey for many people: neatly carved subdivisions, huge malls, big manufacturing plants and office parks.

Buoyed by a robust economy and healthy local tax base, Mr. McGreevey never had to sweat to put the financial ledgers in order, records show.
The town budget has increased to $80 million from $60 million in 1991.
Since 1992, taxes have risen by about 2.4 percent a year, within the rate of inflation.
And even with added borrowing over the last decade, the town is well within its legal debt limit.
By far, Mr. McGreevey's most important financial decision has came in his first year in office, when he decided to accept a state offer allowing municipalities to adjust their fiscal calendars.
In exchange for switching to the state's fiscal year -- giving the state a six-month break from providing local aid -- the towns were permitted to borrow to cover their expenses.

The ultimate cost to taxpayers in interest and principal was estimated at about $60 million over 19 years, with the largest payments beginning in 2001.
Since then, the town has refinanced the bonds twice, securing lower interest rates and pushing the large principal payments to 2003.
Whether the strategy is a long-term success will depend largely on how well the town's finances are doing when these payments start coming due.
If taxes need to be raised, Mr. McGreevey will likely be held responsible.

At his State of the Township address in January 1998, Mr. McGreevey grabbed a hockey stick and slapped a puck into a portable goal in a light-hearted stunt to dramatize his announcement that a private company would build a $10 million recreation center, including two hockey rinks, on the site of a former landfill.
''Our goal is to drop the first puck by the fall or winter of 1999,'' Mr. McGreevey said.
''The one we chose has excellent credentials and a proven track record.''
The recreation center is still not finished.
The company selected to build it is bankrupt.
For now, the town has picked up the $16 million tab.
The center is scheduled to open early next year.
But the deal is now quite different from what Mr. McGreevey promised in 1998.
Instead of a private company paying to build the center, the town has covered the costs through $16 million in short-term bonds.
Now, the town will pay management fees to a local skating business to run the ice and roller rinks and to the Y.M.C.A.
to run the swimming pool and other programs.
Woodbridge will keep any profits, and has solicited private donations.
The town also plans to sell billboard ads in the skating rinks.
Mr. McGreevey says the center will pay for itself.
But if it is not profitable, the taxpayers will be stuck with the bill.
Still, many in town are optimistic.

Not everyone is a fan.
Warren Larsen, who owns an auto parts store, said Mr. McGreevey ''calls himself a full-time mayor, but he only spends 5 percent of his time at Town Hall.''
Mr. McGreevey has also been criticized for allowing political allies to profit from town business.
The Schundler campaign has charged that legal fees in Woodbridge have tripled since Mr. McGreevey took office.
Mr. Weiner resigned as town attorney because of his financial interest in a plan to local a waste transfer station in Linden, N.J., a deal that Mr. McGreevey has staunchly opposed.
This is the first of two articles on the records of the major candidates for New Jersey governor.
Tomorrow's will examine the record of Bret D. Schundler as Jersey City mayor.
Correction: October 20, 2001, Saturday A chart on Thursday summarizing the fiscal record of James E. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, misstated the average annual municipal tax bill for residential property owners in Woodbridge, where he is mayor.
It is $771.13; $3,833.82 is the average total of municipal, county, school and other taxes.
The downward revision matches forecasts that had already been made by many banks.
But it means that Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is perilously close to a recession, and it puts more pressure on the European Central Bank to follow the lead of the Federal Reserve and cut interest rates.
''There is much evidence that one will have to expect a longer problem zone,'' said the economist, Herman Remsperger.
''That means not only that an economic turnaround is unlikely this year, but that the situation will only gradually return to normal next year.''
Germany, heavily dependent on exports of big industrial products and sensitive to the downturn in the United States, is likely to remain one of the slowest-growing countries in Europe this year and next.
Its problems affect much of the rest of the Continent, and all European countries have been hit much harder than they expected by problems in the United States.

In contrast with the United States, most European governments have been cautious about trying to stimulate growth by enacting deep tax cuts or stepping up spending.
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany has repeatedly rebuffed pleas for special programs to shore up particular industries.
French leaders are toying with a modest package of tax reductions, some of them temporary, but economists say they are too small to have much impact.
The European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for all 12 countries that have adopted the euro, continues to resist reducing interest rates.
The economic slowdown is also taking a toll on government budgets.
Here in Germany, the Bundesbank predicted that the budget deficit would double from 1 percent of gross domestic product to 2 percent.
European leaders have already given up hope that countries will continue to reduce their budget deficits this year.
But fear of higher deficits has been the main reason that governments have not tried to stimulate growth with big new tax cuts or spending projects.

I caught the bus with seconds to spare, and we headed north, winding up through dark green mountains, then descending into a high valley of gushing rivers that spilled over a tumble of volcanic rocks.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
We drove 300 yards or so to the inn's parking lot.
But you must go the last few hundred feet by foot, down into a valley where a cluster of thatch-roofed buildings sits astride a rushing hot stream, from which hissing plumes of steam are rising: at first glance, a vision out of Dante.
But then, you step into heaven -- at least if you are an aficionado of hot springs bathing.
The Tohoku region of Japan is known worldwide for its magnificent sulfuric mineral waters.
For generations, Japanese have been going to these springs, called onsen, to relax, surrounded by lovely cool mountains and woods.
The onsen of Tohoku strive to maintain harmony with nature; the buildings are wooden, and every little ryokan prides itself on its rotenburo, or outdoor bath, which is often constructed from mountain rocks, with a view of mountains or streams or both.
I'd always wanted to visit some of Tohoku's remote onsen, but figured I'd need to rent a car to visit them, an expensive undertaking.
But last summer, I came across a new Lonely Planet travel guide, ''Hiking in Japan.''
It contains maps for several multiday treks through Japan's Towada-Hachimantai National Park, which boasts dozens of hot-spring areas.
The main problem was this: after unloading my gear, putting on my yukata, padding in slippers to one of the ryokan's three outdoor rotenburo and easing my body into the sizzling, soothing water, I didn't want to leave Kuroyu Onsen.
Ever.
Quickly inquiring at the office, I booked myself for a third night ($96, including two large Japanese meals).
Venturing into the mixed-sex outdoor bath later that evening (Kuroyu also has separate men's and women's tubs), I was surprised to see a Westerner sitting on the edge of the tub, talking to another bather in fluent Japanese.
He also gave me some tips for enjoying the area, suggesting a short, two-and-a-half-mile hike that would allow me to hop among the valley's six other onsen ryokan.
They generally charge $4 to $10 for use of hot-spring tubs, but Jeff told me about a pass I could buy at the Kuroyu's front desk for $9 that would give me admission to all in Nyuto Onsen.
And the next morning I set out to see how many hot-spring tubs I could bathe in without becoming totally poached.
I ended up going to lunch with her and her husband at a fantastic restaurant down the road, Yama-no-Yado, where steaming bowls of thick mountain vegetable and seafood stew are served at square hearths instead of tables.
Hot tub, lunch, nap, dinner -- finito.
The first two and a half hours, up 4,849-foot Nyuto Mountain, were tiring but not overly difficult.
More obstacles awaited, though.
Still proceeding gingerly, I slid once, then twice more.
I'd walked less than six miles but my knees and quadriceps were begging for mercy.

Luckily, it was out of date: two little ryokan and a steaming geothermal power plant now occupy the valley of Take-no-ue Onsen.

I can only imagine what the two proprietors of the Miyama-so ryokan thought when a foreigner covered in black mud knocked on their door asking for a room in atrocious Japanese.
Hot springs tend to bubble up in the valleys, and so, hiking from onsen to onsen requires one to first climb way up, and then climb way back down.
To get from Take-no-ue to Matsukawa, the next village on this trail, was only a six- or seven-mile hike, but I'd have to climb up and down again, this time about 2,300 feet.
The very thought sent me spinning, and drifting off to sleep, I thought about abandoning my plan.
Wandering down to the other ryokan in the valley, I heard the tinkling of sleigh bells.
It was a Japanese hiking club getting ready to go up the hill I'd just come down, about 15 men and women in Gore-Tex gear with backpacks, hiking sticks -- and wearing bells on their belts to scare away bears.
I rushed up to them, waving my map, and pointing out my planned trail.
Easy?
Hard?
Long?
I mimed how I'd fallen the day before on the slippery slope of Nyuto Mountain.
If I followed a wide mountain road for an hour, instead of the slippery trail, I could cut an hour off my hiking time.
After two hours of descending, I saw a plume of steam, rising over the treetops: Matsukawa Onsen.
Below, I could just see the red roof of a distant ryokan.
Rotten eggs have never smelled so sweet.

Hot springs to soothe sore muscles
Calculated at 120 yen to dollar, I spent $78 a day during six days and nights hiking and bathing in Tohoku, Japan.
This included hotels, all meals, activities and local transportation.
Getting There and Around
I took the Shinkansen bullet train from Kyoto to Tokyo, then to Tazawako, in Tohoku, using a two-week Japan Rail Pass that cost $385; it must be bought before leaving the United States and I did so through the Japan Travel Bureau in New York, (212) 698-4900.
A local bus from Tazawako to the Nyuto Onsen area leaves frequently across the street from the train station.
It takes 45 minutes and costs $6.20.
A Japan Railways bus to the train station from Matsukawa Onsen was free with my rail pass (normally it is $12).
The trails in and around Towada-Hachimantai National Park were well marked and well groomed, except for the section descending Nyuto Mountain.
It is a good idea to learn the names of the places you are hiking in Japanese characters, and perhaps the characters for north, south, east and west.
The guidebook ''Hiking in Japan'' (Lonely Planet, $19.99) contains the character translations for major place names in Towada-Hachimantai.
Where to Stay
In Kyoto, the staff of the Japan National Tourist Organization will make a reservation for you, if you pay for the call.
The office is on the first floor of the Kyoto Tower Building, Shichijo-Karasuma sagaru, Shimogyo-ku; phone (81-75) 371-5649.
Among the organization's offices in the United States is the one at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10020, (212) 757-5640, fax (212) 307-6754; see www.japantravelinfo.com for others.
Kuroyu Onsen in Nyuto Onsen, (81-187) 46-2214, fax (81-187) 46-2280, is a charming, rustic collection of wooden two-story buildings situated by a rushing stream.
The 20 rooms are simple, Japanese-style, with tatami floors and futon beds -- no TV, no phones -- and spotless communal toilets and washrooms.
Very little English is spoken.
If someone from the tourism desk at the Tazawako railway station calls the ryokan, a member of the staff will pick you up at the bus stop.
Miyama-so, at Take-no-ue Onsen, (81-196) 93-4381, is a simple, homey inn with 12 spacious rooms, communal toilets and a very small tub filled with onsen water.
A night, with two typical Japanese meals costs $48.
For a better soak, walk 200 feet down the road to Ryu-Kanso Onsen, (81-196) 93-3038, which has a gorgeous indoor hot tub with a picture window overlooking the hot springs.
A soak there is $4.15.

/jinngroup).
The 40 rooms are quite modern, with phones and televisions.
The ryokan has sex-segregated indoor and outdoor tubs; the women's is spacious and has a pretty view of the countryside.
The price, $42 a night, includes service and taxes but not meals; dinner costs $21, and breakfast $8.50.
Where to Eat
Yama-no-Yado in Nyuto Onsen on the road leading to Tsurunoyu Onsen, (81-187) 46-2100, is both an upscale ryokan and a restaurant open to the public for lunch.
The restaurant serves only three things, listed on the menu from top to bottom: the nabe ($7.50), somen or
udon ($6.70), and wild deer sashimi ($8.35).

''There's no greenery anywhere,'' he says of the harsh Afghan setting.
''The only women are covered by moving black dots across the screen, so you can't see their faces.
There's lots of condemnation of Saudi Arabia being lost to materialism and turning away from the word of God.
There's criticism of colluding with the enemies of Islam.''
Egypt and the Palestinians and even Iraq come in for attack for not being sufficiently fervent in the campaign against materialism and Western values.
''So what do you do with that?''
''The image that's presented is of 18-year-olds in masks running around some low-rent training camp with guns.
I don't find that a vision.''
''What are they going to do to change the politics in their own countries?''
''It's easy to sit back and say it's the Americans' fault.
Experts also find Mr. bin Laden's Afghan backdrop incongruous.
His grievances and his causes are not those of the Afghans, on whose crippled country he has brought the further destruction of a high-tech war.
Ted Eliot, who was American ambassador to Afghanistan from 1973 to 1978 -- between the overthrow of the monarchy under Mohammad Zahir Shah and a pro-Communist coup -- says that Mr. bin Laden's appeal seems ill-suited to Afghans.
''First of all, Afghans are not Arabs,'' Mr. Eliot said in an interview.
They've always been very proud of their independence and very proud of their culture.
They've never harbored this kind of grievance against the Western world that Osama bin Laden is playing on.''
Nor is his anti-Western message likely to mean much to Muslims across Asia, Mr. Eliot said.
''If you go into northwest China, into Xinjiang and the Uighur country, you'll find tremendous resentment against what is considered Han Chinese imperialism.
If you go up into the former Soviet states of Central Asia, you'll find a lot of resentment is against Russian overlordship.''

John Bresnan, a scholar of Indonesia at Columbia University's East Asia Institute and the author of the ''Managing Indonesia,'' published by Columbia University Press, said in an interview, ''The ordinary Muslim in Southeast Asia is as far away from the events of Sept. 11 as you and I.''
In Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country by population but one that has never adopted Islam as a national religion, a history of Hindu and Buddhist influences and strong local cultures have sometimes fed resentment against those who would want to ''Arabize'' their religion or even the architecture of their unique mosques.

Other traditions still rich in pan-Asian elements are strong.
''Against the movements of people like bin Laden, all of these people are moderates,'' Mr. Bresnan said.
The danger he sees is that the latest hostilities will reactivate ''a layer of anti-Americanism just below the surface,'' one that has nothing intrinsic to do with religion.
Large protests have already begun.
Anger at the West is deep-seated in Indonesia, where a long economic crisis and political instability have cut into livelihoods, and many people blame the United States for disastrous advice they believe Indonesia received from the International Monetary Fund.
Supporters of Mr. bin Laden and some neutral experts trying to explain his appeal have rooted it to Muslim grievances in history.
Some reach back a millennium into Christian crusades into Arab homelands.
Others look to the 20th century meddling by Europeans in the Middle East that began with the collapse of the Ottoman Turkish empire after World War I, when the British installed pliant kings on regional thrones.
Some experts minimize this historical sweep as meaningless to Mr. bin Laden's goals.
Mr. Alterman called it ''window dressing.''
''What has he done for the Palestinians?''
''Nothing.
What has he done for the children of Iraq?
Nothing.''

Phebe Marr, a leading expert on Iraq, also discounts too much attention to the distant past.
''Most people are shaped not by the long sweep of history but by what they are taught in school, their own experiences in life and intellectual influences such as the media,'' she said in an exchange of e-mail messages from Qatar, where she is working on a book.
''Most activists are shaped by the immediate past.''
''I would be careful to separate long-term historical trends or events which presumably create a clash of civilizations -- just the impression bin Laden wants to foster -- from short-term events which we can all remember and which can be addressed through policy,'' she said.
''This would include the Arab-Israeli issue and sanctions on Iraq.
Bin Laden has been careful to concentrate on grievances.''
At Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, Lisa Anderson, the dean and an expert on Algeria, agrees that American policies play a role in public opinion.
Echoing Mr. Bresnan on Indonesia, she said that in Islamic societies, including in North Africa, there are conflicting attitudes toward the United States.
On one hand, people are attracted to American life -- anathema to Mr. bin Laden's brand of rejectionist Islam -- but they are also anxious about their own futures.
''What happens,'' she said, ''is that specific missteps by the United States end up being the hooks on which you can hang this profound ambivalence.''
In that environment, Mr. Alterman said, Mr. bin Laden's message can sound reasonable.
''It's a very defensive message and it's delivered with a remarkably soft voice,'' he said.
In contrast to the strident voices of others also on the tape, ''he speaks with a sort of resignation in his voice: 'We have to defend ourselves; this is only what our Scriptures tell us.'
''
''There's some power in the understated delivery,'' he said, ''which in a way makes the outrageousness of much of his message easier to take because you don't feel you are listening to the rantings of a lunatic.''
He had become a target, they say, and he was fed up with the squabbling among many of the 11 participating constituents of the center.
Also, center executives say, he saw the chance to make his mark eroding given the center's deep-seated internal resentments and the city's economic uncertainty.
''He knows it's a no-win situation at this point for him.
The redevelopment, at least as of now, calls for a widespread refurbishment of deteriorated buildings and grounds, a major overhaul of Avery Fisher Hall, home to the New York Philharmonic; and a $300-million new home for the New York City Opera.
Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, has been strongly opposed to two aspects of the plan that have been discussed: creation of a glass dome over Lincoln Center's central outdoor plaza and construction of a building for the New York City Opera in a section of Damrosch Park adjacent to the Met.
There have also been tensions between City Opera and the New York City Ballet, which share the acoustically poor New York State Theater, over whether the ballet would be financially damaged if City Opera left and whether the two organizations could agree on renovations to the stage if the opera company were to stay.
Most elements have been agreed upon, Mr. Rose said; the remaining issues have to do with Lincoln Center's public spaces and the new opera house.
The dome is no longer part of the project.
''I'm sad,'' she said.

I think Marshall feels he has reached the point where, in his mind, he was finished.''

Mr. Rose said he expected the master plan to be submitted with three options for the New York City Opera: having it remain in the State Theater, provided that it can reach agreement with the City Ballet; building a new opera house off-campus; or building a new opera house in Damrosch Park, while making adjustments to keep the park from being significantly diminished.
But executives at Lincoln Center say it is unlikely that Mr. Volpe will agree to a plan that includes such options, and a plan must be unanimously accepted by the constituents to proceed.
On the City Opera proposal for a new home in Damrosch Park, Ms. Sills, once that organization's reigning diva and later its general director, said, ''They still have a right to dream.''
And I think he would like to play a constructive role.''
Rebecca Robertson, the executive director of the redevelopment project, said she would stay on.
''My obligation as executive director of this is to deliver something I really believe the constituents want and need,'' she said.
Whether the city will be able to come through on its pledge of support also remains in question in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Although Mr. Rose acknowledged that his task had been a difficult one -- managing ''constituents with strong and sometimes conflicting opinions'' -- he said in a letter to the various participating arts groups that, ''The elements are in place for the constituents to choose a master plan that meets both the needs and the aspirations of Lincoln Center and the various cultural institutions that comprise it.''
''It's not a sense of frustration.
It's really when you realize you're now at this point when somebody has to get involved and stay involved for a long period of time.''
''It's the style that I like to work in,'' he said.
Senators Hillary Clinton and Charles E. Schumer have been trying to cobble together a more modest proposal, drawing from plans offered by business leaders and New York officials that they believe would have an easier time making it through Congress now that the country's wartime bills are growing, too.

City officials say they while they do not begrudge the state any of its wish list, they would be happy with a plan that costs the federal government more in lost -- and ultimately unanticipated -- revenue than in pure cash outlays.
''The city has a lot of needs,'' said one official, ''but in Lower Manhattan we are looking at specific elements to encourage employers to come in and to encourage developers to build new buildings.
The goal is to keep lower Manhattan as the financial hub.''
Last week, the city's budget director, Adam Barsky, and Deputy Mayor Robert Harding paid calls to legislative leaders in Washington and to officials in the Bush administration to press their case.
The city proposes offering businesses $5,000 per employee the first year, and would decrease that incentive to $2,500 per worker for each of the next two years.
The cash benefit could be applied to the company's federal tax bill, or taken as a lump sum.
The city offers a modest version of this plan involving city taxes for businesses opening in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan.

The program for returning businesses to lower Manhattan would be capped at $750 million, or the estimated amount needed to repopulate what some calculate is the 25 million square feet of space lost to the attack.
The cap is designed to signal to the federal government that the city is not trying to tuck general economic development into the package.
Other refinements under consideration by Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton include tax credits for businesses and tax-exempt financing for reconstruction projects, according to people familiar with the plan.
Their plan would likely lengthen the time period of the cash credit for employees and might not contain a cap.
For some developers, who are loath to build in Manhattan because of high costs and bureaucratic hurdles, the city would like to offer access to tax-exempt bonds that would significantly reduce their costs of building.
The city envisions developers going to its Industrial Development Authority to secure bonds on which purchasers would not be obligated to pay city, state or federal taxes, in turn lowering the interest rate for the developers.
City officials argue that the benefit is attractive because although it would represent a loss of about $13 billion in tax revenues for the federal government, it would not require a cash payout to the city.
Outside of rebuilding and repopulating the area, known as the Liberty Zone, the city would also like to have a federal insurance pool created for businesses that cannot afford insurance, and pay for the rebuilding of a destroyed power substation, subway station and telephone switching station at a cost of roughly $2 billion.

ON Wednesday, when the details of the next quarterly auction of government securities are announced, the Treasury should offer some hints about how it will handle the swing from huge government budget surpluses to none at all.
But the Treasury is not expected to make any drastic changes in the way it does business.
For one thing, the Treasury is assuming that any budget deficits will be temporary.
If surpluses return in future years, the need for increased borrowing wouldn't last long.
That assumption is partly political.
But it is too soon for the Treasury to decide otherwise, with forecasters expecting the economy to recover sometime next year.
The Treasury also does not want to do anything that might send longer-term interest rates higher and thus hinder the prospects for economic recovery.
''My own reading of the yield curve gives me cause for optimism, not pessimism,'' he said in a speech in New York.
''Ten-year yields are lower now than they were in August, so we have not seen any backup in long-term rates that might suggest anxiety about our long-run fiscal prospects.''
He also said the additional borrowing would ''easily be absorbed by our capital markets.''

Treasury officials are not talking on the record about their thinking before the announcement, scheduled for Wednesday, on the quarterly auction of 5-year and 10-year notes on Nov. 6 and 7.
But it appears that the announcement will set in motion a plan to cover as much as $300 billion in extra borrowing by selling additional Treasury bills and short-term notes, like the two-year note.
The size of the monthly two-year note auction has already been increased to $19 billion from $10 billion in May.
And the weekly auctions of six-month Treasury bills have jumped to $17.8 billion from $13.6 billion during that time.
The Treasury has also begun selling a new four-week bill -- $8 billion of them last week.

Because of this additional short-term borrowing, the size of the five-year note auction will rise just $1 billion or $2 billion above the $13 billion in May.
The 10-year note auction will be around $5 billion, less than the expected $10 billion because of the unscheduled auction on Oct. 4 of $6 billion of additional 10-year notes.
In addition, the Treasury is expected to continue buying back longer-term debt, although the total may decline each year.
Concentrating its borrowing in shorter-term securities fits well with two Treasury goals.
One is to try to move the average maturity of the government debt back toward five years.
So the average maturity of government debt is now six years.
Another goal is to reduce the cost of borrowing for the taxpayer over time.
Issuing Treasury bills with yields just over 2 percent and two-year notes with yields of 2.6 percent should do that.
Selling two-year notes now also fills a void in 2003 and 2004, when the amount of maturing government debt is due to decline.
The yield on the 10-year note, now 4.52 percent, is near its 1998 low of 4.16 percent, and some people may say that such low longer-term interest rates should be locked in for future savings.
But Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, said greater long-term savings could be achieved using lower-yielding maturities, especially if the return to government deficits is brief.
''The short-term debt is cheaper and there is no urgency to make major adjustments,'' he said.
On Saturday, American planes carried out their heaviest raids yet here, winning the praise of alliance commanders who are expected to wage a ground offensive.

But one of the final bombs of the day demolished a civilian house about two miles inside Northern Alliance territory, killing a 25-year-old mother of two and wounding eight other civilians.
Officials in the local hospital also reported treating three civilians injured in bombing on the Taliban side.
While that offensive is in support of the rebels, to members of the Northern Alliance here such bombing suggests the inconsistent nature of the American campaign.
But in general, for alliance forces to break through Taliban lines or around the cities of Mazar-i-Sharif and Galoqan in northern Afghanistan, several days of unyielding strikes should be carried out in one place, alliance leaders back in the Bagram area say.
''Don't let them sleep.
Then we will be able to break the lines.''
It is becoming increasingly clear that the loose coalition of northern minority groups fighting the Taliban has its own problems, as it appears increasingly to be a largely ineffective political and military force.
It is clearly reeling from the assassination last month of the charismatic military leader Ahmed Shah Massoud.

The alliance has failed to choose the 60 delegates it will send to a long-delayed meeting on forming a post-Taliban government.
Nearly a month ago, an alliance delegation in Rome agreed to send the 60 representatives to meet with 60 other people representing exiled dissident groups and the former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah.
But neither side has selected its delegates.
Alliance officials say they hope that the meeting will take place sometime before the end of November.
The plodding pace and logistical problems that cripple the alliance were also on display here today.
Burhanudin Rabbani, political head of the alliance, gathered with various senior ministers today in the Panjshir Valley.
Various senior generals including Abdul Rashid Dostum, the commander in the pocket of territory that the alliance controls south of Mazar-i-Sharif, also were unable to attend, in his case because it was too dangerous to leave.
Weather permitting, General Fahim should arrive by Monday.

If it meets, the leadership council could decide where alliance forces should attack.
So far, alliance commanders near Kabul say they have received no orders yet to attack.
Refugees arriving from Kabul today, the sort of people who in the past have been fervent in their support of the United States and the Northern Alliance, questioned what both groups were doing.
''They are fed up with the bombing,'' he said of the city's residents.
He said that if the bombing continued with no clear result and mounting civilian casualties, frustration with the alliance and the United States would grow.
Kabul residents, he said, are looking for decisive military action.
''They are very interested in waiting for the Northern Alliance to come into Kabul,'' he said.
''They are waiting, but no one comes.''

Argentina has about $132 billion in public-sector debt, of which about $70 billion is in global bonds.
He did not say how he would entice investors into such a swap, but indicated that Argentina would be better able to guarantee that the principle and interest would be paid.

Several analysts said that such a big swap, or restructuring, of debt would be hard to accomplish voluntarily.
If it provided any major relief for Argentina from its burden of interest and principle payments it might turn out to be a very unattractive swap for investors.
''If you do an exercise that massive on favorable terms, the chances that you will be successful with a voluntary restructuring is not very high,'' said Jose M. Barrionuevo, director of emerging markets strategy and economics at BNP Paribas.
Mr. Cavallo had been working on a swap of old debt for new, lower-interest debt with local banks and pension funds and apparently still wants to include this debt in any swap.
But some top credit rating agencies said that they would view such a swap as a default, even if voluntary.
S.& P. now rates Argentine sovereign debt a CCC+, which reflects a high probability default.
D is the default rating.
On the other hand, many long-time analysts in the emerging market bond business view voluntary swaps of debt as a way to avoid default.
''If an exchange is done in a voluntary manner that would not constitute a default,'' said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging markets economic research at Salomon smith Barney.
Most economists are forecasting that the economy will bounce back by the middle of next year, assuming that Congress and the administration will pass some combination of tax cuts and spending increases to augment the Federal Reserve's continuing campaign of interest rate cuts.

''We are playing with fire if we don't pass a reasonable stimulus,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers.
If the expectation built into stock prices and economic forecasts for passage of the stimulus plan is removed, Mr. Lindsey said, ''I think there is a significant risk to the economy.''
Democrats said that if Mr. Bush was serious about getting a bill passed this year, he would have to be more active in brokering a compromise.
The president ''has to step up as well and spend the appropriate time and send the appropriate signals,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
''Otherwise I fear that those who shout the loudest, who tend to be the most partisan, are going to make this into a partisan exchange.''
Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Lindsey, along with Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, set out the administration's views on a variety of economic matters in an interview with a small group of reporters.
They said they were skeptical about the approach emerging in Congress for dealing with the reluctance of insurers to provide coverage against terrorist attacks.

Under a bipartisan proposal being discussed in the Senate, the government would not step in to help until the insurance industry has paid as much as $10 billion in claims for any terrorist attacks next year.
The administration has proposed paying at least 80 percent of any claims from the first dollar next year.
Mr. O'Neill said the $10 billion figure, should it become law, might well lead insurers to set premiums so high that companies would be unable or unwilling to pay, forcing Congress and the administration to revisit the legislation to keep the economy operating.
''If it doesn't work, we're going to have to do something else,'' Mr. O'Neill said.
''Our economy cannot be committed to go into the tank because we failed to provide a risk insurance process that works.''
''The starting point is to err on the side of action with regard to the true emergencies we face,'' he said.
''Everything else will be scrutinized even more carefully than before.''
Administration officials played down the partisan eruptions over the economic stimulus package, but on Capitol Hill tensions only intensified.
Mr. Grassley said the tax cuts in his package would total $89 billion this year, well above the $60 billion to $75 billion Mr. Bush has proposed.
Democrats said any bill they bring up in the Senate would have to address the needs of unemployed workers by expanding the unemployment insurance program and offering laid-off workers substantial help in paying health-insurance premiums -- provisions Republicans have resisted.
''We will not even consider a bill unless it has those components,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.
Though fewer bonds had been issued the last few years, the elimination of 30-year bonds will require changes by bond professionals, institutions and individual investors.
Investment alternatives include government agency and corporate bonds.

In explaining the Treasury's decision, Peter Fisher, the undersecretary for domestic finance, said, ''We do not need the 30-year bond to meet the government's current financing needs, nor those that we expect to face in coming years.''
''The 30-year bond,'' he said, ''no longer maintains a position of significance in the financial markets.''
Mr. Fisher added that ''today's decision is in no way an attempt to manage long-term interest rates.''
Reflecting the fact that 30-year bonds will now be scarce, the price jumped 58/32 points, about seven times more than a normal daily move.
The demise of 30-year bonds, including those indexed for inflation, will increase demand for the 10-year note.
''I think injecting this change into the market, particularly in a time of crisis, is not smart,'' said Charles Parkhurst, managing director of government bond trading at Salomon Smith Barney.
''If the Treasury said that the February bond would have been the last and the market would get to to bid on it, the decision would have been more acceptable.''
The outside committee of bond market professionals that advises the Treasury on policy had recommended the retirement of the 30-year bond.

''The Treasury Department's decision today to suspend issuance of the 30-year bond is reasonable and understandable based on its conclusion that the cost of continuing issuance of these bonds in the current market is not justifiable,'' he said.
Since 1977, $564.4 billion of regular 30-year bonds have been sold to the public.
About $40 billion of inflation-protected 30-year bonds have been sold since 1998.
With the diminishing role of the 30-year bond, the 10-year note has become the benchmark for the Treasury market.
Longer-term debt of government agencies, like Fannie Mae, is vying for the role previously served by the 30-year bond.
Investors will probably substitute agency debt or corporate debt for 30-year Treasuries, though there is additional risk in such securities.
The issue of savings for the taxpayer, one reason for the elimination of the 30-year bond, is simple.
Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, has advocated the demise of the 30-year bond for some time.
His analysis of borrowing in the early 1990's showed that the government made significant savings in interest costs by choosing to sell more short-term debt, even with 30-year bond yields near historic lows.

The Treasury's decision seems to be an implicit bet that the budget will move back into surplus soon.
Mr. Fisher said that if deficits persist, it would be easy for the government to return to selling 30-year bonds.
In the interim, he added, ''it is still likely that our decision to suspend 30-year borrowing at this time will have saved the taxpayers money.''
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, has criticized the Bush administration's surplus projections as being too optimistic but still supports the decision to shift to shorter-term debt.
''I can understand the logic of doing this even if I disagree with the administration's 10-year budget projections,'' he said.
The Treasury also announced yesterday that it would curtail, but not discontinue, its program of buying back higher-interest rate debt with 20 or more years to maturity.
Since March 2000, the Treasury has bought back $57.5 billion in old debt.
It will proceed with the scheduled buybacks of $6.5 billion of debt in November and December but do none in January.
Beginning with February, it will announce each quarter whether it will do buybacks, depending on its cash flow and borrowing needs.
Mr. Fisher said this meant there would be buybacks in some quarters and not in others.
The Treasury also said it would sell next week $16 billion of new five-year notes and $7 billion of the existing 10-year note, which matures in August 2011.

had intensified its inquiry into the company's finances, making it a formal investigation, carrying subpoena power.
And today, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on Enron's senior debt by one notch, leaving it a few notches above junk bond status.
If Enron's credit rating were dropped below investment grade, it could force the company to issue millions of shares of stock to satisfy debts and prompt other big energy-trading concerns to curtail their business with Enron.
S.& P. said that the company's ''financial flexibility has continued to diminish'' and that it had been unable ''to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of Enron's core energy marketing business.''
But the rating agency also said it thought that ''Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty'' and that, so far, ''most counterparties have maintained their trading activity with Enron.''
The line of credit may help the company convince investors and trading partners that it can weather this crisis.

The contract has soared from about $2.70 over the last two weeks as Enron's troubles became public.
''Enron has a massive exposure to both the buy side and the sell side in gas and other commodities,'' said Jay Saunders, oil and gas analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown, ''and if they're at risk financially, then you're exposed to that so you want to cover that risk.
Anybody who has Enron as a counterparty in a trade might be concerned about getting paid.''
Mr. Saunders added that other factors had also lifted prices lately, including falling rates of gas being put in storage for use this winter.

Jonathan King and Jim Stott, Stonewall's owners, have based the company in York since 1995 and in neighboring Kittery, Me., before that.
The headquarters store is expected to have sales of $3 million this year, Mr. King said, and the number of visitors has surpassed expectations.
Instead of a hotel tower, a farmhouse-style structure lavishly surrounded with flowers and birch trees now sits at York's gateway intersection of Route 1 and an off-ramp from Interstate 95.
Visitors relax in Adirondack chairs under pergolas out of sight of passing cars, and plans have been approved for a 70-seat cafe.
He pointed out such details as a pressed tin ceiling and sliding barn doors that separate the test kitchen from a conference room.
Stonewall invested nearly $8 million in the 55,000-square-foot faux farmhouse with rooflines of varying heights.
The town offered a $3.5 million industrial revenue bond at a 3.5 percent interest rate to help the project as well as a $400,000 grant, with the balance coming from the company's founders and investors.
Other start-up companies have found a shortage of commercial space, said Steve Burns, the town planner.
Demand for commercial space, he said, is slower and steadier than for residential and more fluid as merchants enter and leave the area.
The town's commercial users are storage facilities and light industrial tenants, like woodworking shops.
No study has addressed the town's maximum commercial capacity.
On the residential side, more than 1,000 new housing units have been built since 1990 and requests for 130 new housing units per year have made this Maine's second-fastest growing town.
''The sentiment here is antigrowth,'' Mr. Burns said, ''but you can't stop it.
It's a fundamental fairness issue for people who own property and we've never had an external control like the limits of a water, sewer or school system.''
Mr. Burns estimates that the town's population of 14,000 doubles when overnight guests are included in the summer peak season and may actually triple when daily visitors are counted.
Only a 90-minute drive north from Boston, the town attracts home buyers who work in the suburban Route 128 technology corridor.

Empty-nest retirees are a large constituency in York, but they compete for home sites with a growing number of entrepreneurs who run businesses from home.
Andrew Siegel and his brother, Ron, own the When Pigs Fly Bakery, a bread maker that expanded this summer to 25,000 square feet of production space, with a retail store.
The 50-employee company sells bread as far south as New Jersey, thanks to a location close to Interstate 95.
''You couldn't find this kind of space in Boston,'' Andrew Siegel said.
''And York is a family-oriented community.
You can build a nice house here and be close to the ocean.''

York is a 55-square-mile territory -- nearly as big as Boston -- ranging from seaside cliffs to hilly interior land near creeks, ponds and reservoirs.
In its 300-year history, several independent towns and villages have been combined, merging their various personalities: the beachfront motels, the Route 1 commercial corridor, the historically protected area and inland homes on heavily wooded property.
Many residents operate small businesses from their homes and may have trucks, small craft shops or assembly operations in their garages.
The town has strict zoning requirements that make fast-food restaurants impossible.
Meanwhile, culinary destinations like Stonewall Kitchen, along with other shops that sell pies and baked goods, have caused growing pains.
Stonewall rents warehouse space in town and relies on local suppliers like as Carpe Diem Coffee Roasters.
''But York County has no tax incentives and there's an unemployment rate here of 1.5 percent.
To say 'Made in Maine' is a lure for our buyers.''
Cathy Goodwin, the organization's executive director, said her group might develop an alternative.
Among the blueprints awaiting review at Town Hall is a proposal for 16 small workshops, complete with small offices and truck bays near Route 1.
These could provide rented 30-foot-by-40-foot spaces for companies that are too big for home but too small for most industrial facilities.
Michael Conlon, a real estate broker at Century 21 Atlantic Realty, conceded that traffic has got progressively worse in his 15 years in the business but said that few developers have given up on their projects.
''Commercial growth has come along with the increased population.''
Republicans pushed their plan for another round of tax cuts that would largely benefit companies and upper-income people.
Democrats pressed for an approach that would give most help to the unemployed and those with lower incomes, and would rely in large part on increased government spending.
''We're seven weeks after the event,'' said Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City Bank in Cleveland, referring to the attacks, ''and they're still debating.''
''It is getting late,'' Mr. DeKaser added.
It is not just Congress and the administration that are under pressure.
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve will meet, and analysts are almost unanimous in predicting that it will cut rates for the 10th time this year.
The Fed has already slashed its benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 2.5 percent from 6.5 percent this year in an effort to stimulate economic activity by reducing borrowing costs.
Interest rate policy works with long lags, and many analysts said the Fed would ultimately prove as effective as ever, a position also held by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
But so far the rate cuts have not had as much effect as expected, some economists said.
In any case, they said, lower rates may not be the right remedy for the economy's major problem: overinvestment by businesses in computers, telecommunications equipment, machinery and other capital goods.
With demand for their goods and services eroding rapidly, companies are unlikely to borrow to finance more capital spending no matter how low interest rates go.

''It's a very different business cycle,'' said William Dudley, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment firm.
''It's an investment boom-bust cycle, and the bust that's followed the boom has created significant imbalances that will take time to be corrected and that are not easily remedied by monetary policy.''
Just how different a cycle this is will be determined in part by how far-reaching the aftereffects of the terrorist attacks prove to be.
Already, policy makers are trying to determine how much effect fear of further attacks and concerns about a drawn-out war will have on consumer and investor confidence.
They are examining whether the improvement in recent years in productivity, or business efficiency, will be wiped out by the costs of tighter security and less reliable transportation.
And they are waiting to gauge the effects of a likely worldwide recession while speculating about the possible effects of further potential economic shocks like a sharp rise in oil prices.
Publicly, administration officials continue to be upbeat, holding out the possibility that the economy could avoid a technical recession by growing in the fourth quarter and suggesting that in any case the recovery is likely to come fairly quickly next year.

''It's too early to tell'' if the United States is in its 10th recession since World War II, said R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
Inflation this time around has been almost dormant.
Yet if the onset of the problem has been different, Mr. Hubbard said, it is nonetheless playing out in a classic pattern, with weakness spreading from manufacturers through the rest of the economy.
There is no reason to think the economy will not also recover as it typically does, he said.
''The dynamics of recovery are likely to be fairly similar to what we've seen before,'' Mr. Hubbard said.
''I have no reason to believe policy won't be very effective, both monetary policy and fiscal policy.''

The policy choices on the table in Washington are fairly orthodox.
Republicans say cutting taxes on companies will reduce pressure on employers to slash jobs, create an incentive to buy equipment soon instead of delaying and help restore confidence and wealth by supporting corporate profits and stock prices.
Cutting all income tax rates, even for the wealthy, would have much the same effect by encouraging job creation and hard work.
The point of an economic stimulus package, said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican minority leader, is ''not to give folks a check for today, but to give them a job for tomorrow.''
If taxes are to be cut, they said, the main recipients should be Americans with low and moderate incomes.
''We should be helping those who need it the most, not those who need it the least,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader.
To the degree that there is any thinking outside of the political box, it is coming from the ideological wings.
Conservative supply-siders want far more sweeping tax cuts than anything getting serious consideration in Congress.
Liberals want public-works-style spending packages, everything from child care to highways, with a particular focus on projects that could help improve domestic security.
Politically, tensions continue to run high.
In the latest twist, Republicans have started turning on Mr. Bush's point man in negotiating a stimulus package, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill.
Asked last week whether Mr. O'Neill should stay on, Mr. Lott said, ''That's the president's decision,'' and added that Mr. O'Neill ''needs to be careful with how he says what he believes.''

The Senate Finance Committee had tentatively planned to push through a Democratic stimulus plan this week.
Then Republicans said they might file as many as 72 amendments to the bill in an effort to tie it up in the committee.
It is still unclear how the logjam will get broken.
Analysts said public pressure will ultimately motivate the politicians on both sides to stop squabbling and come up with a credible response to the deterioration of the economy.
Kim Wallace, a political analyst at Lehman Brothers, the investment firm, said people have been willing to give Congress and the White House a reasonable amount of time but are now growing impatient.
''That reasonable period has been overextended in the eyes of most people,'' Mr. Wallace said.
''It only feeds into the notion that Washington has outlived its usefulness at this stage in the crisis, and that's a dangerous place for an elected member to be a year out from an election.''
''This is the end of Western civilization!''
Unfortunately, that old-time economic religion, with its narrow-minded insistence on monetary rectitude at the expense of every other consideration, has had a revival in recent years, thanks largely to the promotional efforts of right-wing think tanks.
And that ideology, more than anything else, is responsible for Argentina's looming catastrophe.
Why this enthusiasm on the right?
You might think, given all the talk of debt default, that the problem was government profligacy.
But Argentina's budget deficit has ranged between 1 and 3 percent of G.D.P., not bad for a depressed economy, and its government debt is only about half of G.D.P., better than many European countries.
By the numbers, Argentina's fiscal picture looks better than America's did a decade ago.

The real problem with Argentina isn't fiscal, it's economic.
The country is now in its fourth year of grinding recession.
But the rigidity of its monetary system, designed to protect against inflation, precludes any of the actions that countries normally take to fight deflation, such as cutting interest rates or letting the currency depreciate.
Instead, Argentina has gone through wave after wave of fiscal austerity, each time with the promise that the latest round of wage and job cuts would restore confidence and produce economic recovery.
But austerity has not brought recovery.
On the contrary, it has worsened the recession, increased social tension and further reduced confidence.

The natural answer is to remove the straitjacket: let the peso float, and do what is necessary to save the economy.
Admittedly, the fact that much private debt in Argentina is indexed to the dollar means that a peso devaluation might create financial problems.
But as Ricardo Haussman, former chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank (and a strong advocate of sound money), has pointed out, there is an answer: Simply issue a decree canceling the indexation.
It's a radical solution, but the situation is desperate, and there is precedent: it's more or less what Roosevelt did in 1933.
And some investment bankers have privately supported such a plan for months.
But since last spring conservative economists in the U.S. have been urging Argentina to preserve its dollar peg and default on its debt instead.
And that's what's happening.
I've written before about an apparent double standard for economic policy in the third world, but this is truly bizarre.
Advanced countries often devalue their currencies -- but Argentina is being told that it can't.
On the other hand, advanced countries never default on their debt -- but Argentina is being told that it must.
And this even though Argentina isn't heavily in debt by normal standards, and default -- which won't let Argentina cut interest rates, won't make its goods more competitive and won't end the need for draconian fiscal austerity -- will do nothing to end the economic crisis.
It's hard to believe that Argentina will sacrifice not just its economy but its credit rating on the altar of a discredited monetary theology.
But as you read this, Argentine officials are crucifying their long-suffering nation on a cross of dollars.
The trade association for the semiconductor industry predicted today that the sharpest ever decline in chip sales would turn around next year with 6 percent growth, followed by a full-blown recovery in 2003.
The forecast by the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents most chip makers, was more optimistic than several other predictions by independent research firms, which believe the market will grow only slightly at best and shrink 7 percent at worst.
The 31-percent decline would nearly double the decline in 1985, the sharpest drop on record, when the market fell 17 percent.
The association predicted that demand would remain weak in the first half of next year but pick up substantially in the last six months, pushing the market to $150 billion, a 6 percent increase over 2001.
The momentum will carry into 2003 and 2004 with 21 percent growth for each year, the association said.

The recovery is expected in every region of the world.
Asia, which declined 23 percent this year, is expected to lead the surge with 14 percent growth.
The sales of computer chips, the computer brains in everything from personal computers to cell phones to automobiles, are widely seen as a sign of the technology industry's health.
While manufacturers of memory chips and networking processors continue to suffer through a terrible slump, chip makers for PC's and wireless devices have seen signs of improvement in recent months, though revenue has lagged because of price wars.
George Scalise, the trade association's president, said makers of PC and wireless chips have largely cleared out their excess inventory and are beginning to see increases in orders.
More electronics sold means more chips sold.

''We've been through these cycles before, and we know this too shall pass,'' Mr. Scalise said.
''The industry will continue to grow as it has in the past.''
Several agreed that 2003 would improve dramatically over 2002, by as much as 25 percent.
But they questioned whether the industry could improve enough in the second half of next year to offset an expected slow first six months.
''It's very hard to see anything better than flat in '02, because you're starting in a very deep hole,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.
The International Data Corporation, based in Framingham, Mass., has predicted the chip industry would decline by 7 percent in 2002, the first ever consecutive years of shrinking sales.
Mario Morales, a senior vice president in the company's semiconductor group, said the number of chips sold would improve, but their average selling prices have decreased so sharply that chip makers would have trouble surpassing their sales, even compared with such a dreary year as this.
''The major impact is really the price erosion we've witnessed over the last couple of quarters, in not only the PC-related markets but also the wireless and network equipment markets,'' Mr. Morales said.
But the company's president, Bill McClean, acknowledged that companies and consumers could take very little prodding to cut back spending on electronics even further.
''If the U.S. economy proves stubborn to interest rate reductions, and people don't feel comfortable spending for one reason or another, we could easily see single-digit negative growth rates next year,'' he said.
Facing sluggish sales caused by high local interest rates and a slowing economy, the Brazilian unit of said that it would lay off 3,000 of its 28,000 workers starting on Monday.

Terrorism is not Pitney's only challenge, of course.
The company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., commands 85 percent of the American postage meter market and 61 percent of the global market.
But competition is heating up.
Neopost Inc., the French company that is Pitney's main competitor overseas, just bought Ascom Hasler, a Swiss company, and together they command 25 percent of the global postage meter market.
Francotyp-Postalia, a German company, is also nipping away at market share.
But Pitney is bulking up, too.
''Neopost is a strong competitor, but Pitney is making progress in profitability and share in Europe,'' said Deane M. Dray of Goldman, Sachs.
Pitney can expect to have resources soon to expand overseas even more.
Much of its debt carries variable interest rates, so it will be helped by recent cuts in rates.
And it is about to spin its fax and copier business off to shareholders, leaving Pitney free to concentrate still more capital on overseas markets.
Nor has postal chaos appreciably stymied Pitney's domestic prospects.
Every time postal rates go up, Pitney's meter customers must pay the company to have meters recalibrated.
And because customers rent the equipment on long-term contracts, Pitney has a protected stream of recurring revenues.
But mainly, Mr. Critelli is not panicking because he has been preparing for a drop in mail revenue for quite some time.
Many companies already use e-mail for routine correspondence and customer promotions, and many have switched to a distribute-and-print model -- e-mail a document, and let recipients print it out themselves -- for handbooks, contracts and other papers that formerly would have been sent by mail.
Many banks and utilities already have systems in place giving customers access to their bills online, and enabling them to pay those bills either online, via telephone or through direct debits of their checking accounts.
Some 5 million of American Express's 30 million cards, for example, are registered with the company's online site, giving cardholders the option of paying bills electronically.
Earlier this month, Verizon unveiled a newly designed Web page that will make it easier for phone customers to pay bills online.

Pitney is heading that way, too.
It already derives more than a quarter of its approximately $4 billion in annual revenue from nonmail-related services, and it expects that to hit 35 percent next year.
One example is the online bill-paying system Pitney now administers for several customers.
And the company recently acquired Alysis, which specializes in electronic payment systems.

''Our new products have a very different value-add from the old ones,'' Mr. Critelli said.
For now, though, mail-related products are still the revenue leaders for Pitney and its competitors.
Not everyone has a home computer, and most people who do still use the postal system to pay bills.
And catalog companies say that customers who order from their Web sites usually make their selections first from a paper catalog received in the mail.
''The feedback we're getting from customers is that moving away from the mails is simply not an option,'' said Larry Turner, president of Francotyp-Postalia.
More episodes of mail-carried anthrax or other diseases could change that.
But Pitney and its competitors may find business opportunities in the postal fears, too.
Most report a much larger volume of queries from corporations looking to farm out the management of their mailrooms, or to have their mail processed off site.
Many are pushing equipment that opens letters automatically and lets handlers see the contents without touching them.
Francotyp-Postalia is working with several European companies to find ways to build biosensors and decontamination technology into equipment that sorts and opens mail.
Xerox Business Services is working on a technology that would enable post offices to receive mail electronically and print it out on site.
Pitney, Neopost and Franco-Postalia are all offering digital meters that include information about the sender along with postage, as well as using codes that enable mail to be tracked and located at any time.
Such monitoring capabilities may provide a comfort level that could increase the use of metered mail.
''There's a tug of war between two dynamics -- potentially lower mail volumes, and a shift to metered mail and mailroom management,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
''The short-term implications for Pitney are negative, but long term, they're positive.''
Thousands of articles have been written about the case, as well as several books -- including one by Sam Sheppard himself and one by his son.
But there's plenty left to say, as James Neff, an investigative reporter and author who spent a decade obsessed by it, demonstrates.
''The Wrong Man'' is an exhaustive piece of detective work -- no blood fleck goes unexamined, no participant in the case escapes Neff's scrutiny.
After indicting the press, the judicial system and the city of Cleveland, Neff offers his own version of the crime scenario, which squarely positions Eberling as the killer.
Neff disdains the press for its one-sided and prurient reporting on the Sheppard case, though he isn't above a little prurience himself.
He doesn't spare readers the gory details of Marilyn Sheppard's murder, and then returns to them several times when he introduces new scientific theories and evidence.
Sperm as well as tissue and blood become crucial to the story (and so do the Sheppards' sex life and Marilyn's flimsy pajamas).

Neff puts the case in the valuable context of the social climate that fed the frenzy surrounding the Sheppard trial.
He suggests, for example, that the hostility of the medical establishment toward osteopaths, the profession practiced by Sam Sheppard, his father and his brothers, added to the suspicion of Dr. Sam.
He also puts the trial in the context of the McCarthy era and 1950's sexual mores, and he shows how local politics worked against the doctor.
The book also peeks into the more arcane corners of scientific detective work, conducted by specialists like Paul Kirk, ''the founding father of criminalistics.''
More important, Neff illustrates how useless sophisticated technical evidence can be in jury cases.
''Imagine how lost the jury must be,'' the reporter replied.
Neff has a blunt, impersonal style that's fine for the bulk of the book, which methodically examines this miscarriage of justice.
But despite the value of Neff's accomplishment, it's hard not to wish he had a more literary vision, particularly as the story turns to Sam Reese Sheppard and his quest to remedy the harm to his father and their family.
The tragedy runs deep.
Sam Sheppard's mother committed suicide following her son's conviction and her husband's death.
The book loses momentum after Sam Sheppard dies.
Neff builds a convincing case against Eberling, who died in 1998, after being jailed for another murder but before the author could wrest a confession from him about Marilyn Sheppard.
But his story isn't that interesting, especially to a reader already exhausted from the myriad details and subplots of the Sheppard saga.
Still, ''The Wrong Man'' generally makes a good stew from its potboiler ingredients.
There's a corrupt judge, a vindictive coroner, a voracious press, ignorant jurors, an attractive young victim and a defendant who is a successful and handsome doctor.
But he wasn't charming.
Sam Sheppard lied blatantly and repeatedly about having cheated on Marilyn, and -- perhaps even worse for his cause -- seemed condescending toward the jurors.
Neff, who now lives in Seattle but grew up in Cleveland, seems to take the injustices committed against Sam Sheppard personally.
This fierce reporter seems bent on having the final word on this small-minded and corrupt chapter in his hometown's history, and that determination gives his book a gripping zealousness.
A table in the Automobiles section on Friday showing the costs of financing new cars misstated the amount a buyer with the best credit rating would pay on a 48-month loan for a $30,000 vehicle.

A small group of demonstrators, including one dressed as an angry cola can, held a protest at a screening of ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' on Sunday in Washington.
''Our basic concern is that Miss Rowling has permitted Coca-Cola to have the exclusive global marketing rights to the Harry Potter film,'' said MARK JACOBSON, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group.
''It's a betrayal of her audience to allow Harry Potter imagery to be used to sell junk food to kids.''
Coca-Cola signed a $150 million deal this year making AOL Time Warner, the corporate parent of Warner Brothers, which is releasing the film, the sole global marketing partner for the film, which is based on the Harry Potter books by J. K. ROWLING.
Coca-Cola has also pledged $18 million to literacy efforts.
''The idea that they would characterize our sponsorship of the film and our national and global efforts to provide millions of books to children around the world as inappropriate,'' a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, SUSAN McDERMOTT, said yesterday, ''and to infer a connection misses the point for the sake of sensationalism.''

The financial problems of the provinces are closely intertwined with those of the national government, whose ballooning fiscal deficit has made Argentina a headache for international financial markets and a threat to the economy of the entire region.
But the problems on the local level show that the roots of the current economic crisis run deep, have few easy solutions and will probably take many years to fix.

Provincial governments across Argentina are choking from their combined $23 billion debt, the product of a deepening 41-month-old recession and of their large inefficient bureaucracies, known better for corruption and political patronage than for service.
The provincial debt is jeopardizing the health of banks that hold provincial bonds and pushing up interest rates that depress businesses and increase unemployment.
It is also devastating Argentina's long-vaunted public health and education systems.
San Juan's provincial police have not received paychecks for a month, while several thousand disabled people have not received pensions for five months.
The decay can be seen at the 428-bed Rawson Hospital in the city of San Juan, constructed in 1916 on the French public health model.
The stained-glass windows, fine mosaic work and majestic marble staircases in the French style recall a period of great economic expansion in Argentina, while the long lines of patients milling around hallways of cracking paint and buzzing flies reflect a grimmer present.
Administrators complain that they have run out of essential medicines and surgical instruments because money from the provincial government has been delayed at a time when the hospital is flooded with newly unemployed patients who have lost their health insurance.
''I can't make it on that,'' he said.
The hospital's 300 doctors have gone unpaid for months at a time, producing 80 days of strikes this year that precluded all but emergency medical care.

''The country's debts are too big and they just get passed on from one president to the next while the working people suffer.''
Money is so tight that the provincial government has stopped paying the gas bill at the Bernardo de Monteagudo elementary school in a working-class neighborhood just outside San Juan.
Without gas, the school can no longer boil the water to mix with powdered milk, forcing a switch to far more expensive fresh milk and a one-third drop in servings for children who frequently come to school without having had breakfast.
''Malnutrition is getting worse, which is holding back learning and worsening behavioral problems,'' said the school's principal, María Alicia Aguirre.
''The government has to start thinking of education as an investment and not a place to cut costs.''
But milk is just one of the school's problems.
Teachers are short of books and must make copies of pages so the children will have reading materials.
Bathrooms are breaking down because the province has cut back on maintenance.
Twenty-six of the school's 30 teachers, who are paid an average of $400 a month, went on strike for two months in August and September when they were not paid, causing the students to fall behind in their studies.
A lack of federal financing is to blame for their problems, the governors say.
The central government, which is tottering from its own $132 billion debt and on the verge of default, was unable to pay more than $800 million it owed to the provinces over the last year.
Forty percent of future financing will also be paid in scrip, which will be used to pay salaries, pensions and bills and flood the economy with a currency that economists predict will lose value over time.
But economists say that most of the provincial financial problems stem from unwieldy bureaucracies, built by old-fashioned political bosses.
Eighty-five percent of the San Juan government's $783 million annual budget, for instance, goes to wages rather than services.
The bureaucracy of 30,000 workers, combined with their family members, make up a big political bloc that resists wage cuts or trimming of inefficient agencies.

''San Juan residents work and produce to allow the state to subsist, even though it does not serve the purpose for which it was created,'' Federico Manrique, an economics writer at the San Juan daily newspaper Diario de Cuyo, complained in a column this week.
''What is the purpose of having more police per capita than New York if there isn't enough fuel to keep them on patrol or enough money to buy them uniforms?''
''If I fire public employees they will knock on our doors for food, and where will I get it?''
''And if I slash salaries, economic activity will slide and the merchants will suffer.
No one is going to reach a zero deficit as long as there is a recession.''
''Hundreds of pounds of top American engineering and musicianship,'' he boasts to a woman who pauses to look at the Korean-made behemoth.

His increasingly hopeless efforts to make a sale (he draws encouragement when one small nose-picker halts excavations to listen to his spiel) only heat up his fiery, furious faith in Perfect Execution.
Recipient of his rants and fury is Barry, hired to demonstrate the organ but preferring to stare at the young women passing.
Barry is a victim of another American success illusion.
Less manic than his brother, he is seemingly more open to reality.
This, however, takes the form of serial affairs (another illusion) until he meets the glance of Leila passing by and believes himself to be in love.
Leila, though, is skittish, having had various unpleasant incidents with assorted male stereotypes.
She flees but returns eventually.
There takes place a remarkably original, remarkably well-sensed progression in which all three (Ed joins them) drink beer and helped by it advance tentatively out of sales mania, seducer's apathy and victim fear, respectively, to resurrect briefly their alienated selves.
The moment gives way to arbitrary melodrama.

There is a startling contrast of strengths and weaknesses in Mr. Sernovitz's novel.
Some of the set pieces are skillful.
Besides Ed's comical efforts at selling his organ and the scene just mentioned, there are two extended passages, one dealing with his descent from grandiosity to work out his disastrous accounts at the end of the day, the other with Barry's resigned efforts to make a go of his band.
The author knows how things work, and don't work, and recounts the knowledge impressively.
Other scenes are unconvincing.
For example an account of a vague pass made by one of Leila's professors and her panicky reaction.
On the other hand there is a dolefully comic portrait of a stolid, brutish early lover who believes that courtship consists mainly of asking questions.
Leila reacts with decent gumption, but for much of the time she is too exaggeratedly fragile to be believable.
None of the three main characters seem to have much existence of their own.
The author configures them, sometimes very well and at other times not so well, but among their performances they tend to sag.
They represent what Mr. Sernovitz has to say about the ersatz qualities in a largely postagricultural Midwest (a factory farm is a factory, not a farm).
And he can be provocative, amusing and sometimes moving.
There is the number he does on cream puffs, the fair's gastronomic specialty.
We are all, we are all, we are all farmers, farmers who have lost our way.''
And in a scene whose nostalgia nevertheless fixes the author's theme, Leila slips from panic and briefly touches ground.
She visits the fair's cattle enclosure and finds a girl grooming her prize cow.
''Leila felt, That girl is me.
She was Leila who never woke to that is what I am.
She was Leila who would cry not for her own sake but for the cow's.''
Chilly and difficult to reach, these forests are typically the last areas to be colonized by people, a final refuge of biodiversity in places where lowlands have been cleared and developed.

''Many cloud forest organisms have literally nowhere to go,'' said Dr. Nalini M. Nadkarni, an ecologist at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash. ''They're stuck on an island of cloud forest.
If you remove the cloud, it's curtains for them.''
Of equal concern, some scientists say, are the study's implications for the many watersheds fed by wet highland forests.
''We always knew that if you have a town and a mountain behind it, you protect the mountain forests to protect the water,'' said Dr. James O. Juvik, a tropical ecologist at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.
''This says, even if you leave the cloud forest intact like good conservationists, if you clear the lowland forests, you can diminish the cloud forest and affect your water flow.''
Scientists said that it was unclear whether deforestation or global warming would be a more potent force, but that the two could easily heighten each other's effects in the mountains.
While watered by rains during the rainy season, Monteverde gets most of its critical moisture during the dry season from the mist and fog of low-lying clouds.
That warmer, drier air, they reasoned, might be forced to rise higher to make clouds, robbing parts of the forest of critical moisture.

Shifts in fog and mist up and down a mountain are subtle changes not easily seen and rarely quantified, so it should not be surprising that one of the first places where such changes would be noticed would be Monteverde, a cloud forest heavily peopled by scientists.
Begun as a colony of expatriate North American Quakers, Monteverde has been a huge attraction for American biologists, many of whom have devoted their careers to the flora and fauna of the region.
A quick look at the forest's inhabitants makes clear why -- from the record-breaking diversity of orchids to creatures like the resplendent quetzal, a glittering green, kite-tailed bird truly worthy of its name, and the so-called singing mice that whistle and chirp like birds.
Longtime researchers say they can see the biological effects of the shifting mists and clouds as well.

''What really makes it obvious is you can look out the window now and see species you never saw up here before,'' said Dr. J. Alan Pounds, resident biologist at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve.
''We see the black-headed nightingale-thrush and the keel-billed toucan, species you normally only see further downslope.
They're now inhabiting what used to be good cloud forest.''
Researchers say the effects of deforestation and global warming might also explain other mysteries on the mountain, including the puzzling disappearance of Monteverde's golden toad.
A flashy orange creature last seen in the late 1980's, the golden toad has become an international symbol of the world's disappearing amphibians.
Seeing how even pristine and protected forests like those at Monteverde can lose their crucial mists and clouds, researchers say it becomes less mysterious how a water-loving creature like the golden toad could vanish even from a forest where every tree still stands.
The disappearance of such charismatic creatures is not only a worry for biologists.
Monteverde is an eco-tourism mecca, with nearly 50,000 nature-loving visitors walking its trails each year, stopping for a bite to eat or perhaps picking up a golden toad mug or Monteverde T-shirt along the way.
Scientists say that if the cloud forest falters, much business will be lost along with the unique species.
''Unfortunately, Monteverde is on the crest of a mountain,'' Dr. Juvik said.
''Maybe if it were on the side, it could migrate upward with the clouds.
In this case, it's already at the top.
If you move the cloud forest up, then the cloud forest is bye-bye.''
But Dr. Nadkarni said she hoped the new study would at least rally the scientific troops to begin studying and documenting Monteverde's changes.
''We need to monitor what's going on,'' she said.
''This is happening now.''
Though Wall Street slipped yesterday, the bear market that prevailed since early 2001 has technically expired, with the major indices standing about 20 percent above their September lows.
Since the market often offers a preview of the economy's future, the recent gains suggest that a recovery is still on schedule for late next year.
The economy itself has shown some promising signs of late, but the markets still face a few big risks.
Consumer confidence may be on the upswing, but that will be tested by reports of disappointing earnings, bankruptcies and job losses that are likely to emerge in the next few months.
The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators also rose slightly in October, a pleasant surprise for the markets.
Low gasoline prices have presented a double bonus to the economy, since they help consumers directly and also make it more attractive to leave home and spend money on other things.
The unexpectedly rapid success of the war in Afghanistan has probably boosted confidence as well.
At least one of the world's financial trouble spots looks less precarious.
The International Monetary Fund has applauded Turkey's economic reforms and may offer more aid to help it through the global downturn.
Argentina's attempt to lower interest rates on its debt should succeed at home but may stall when investors abroad are asked to join in.
So far, though, neither country's problems have seriously contaminated its neighbors' economies.
The outlook remains unclear.
Falling applications for building permits suggest that the housing market has begun to slow.
A dropoff in home values could discourage consumers, and Wall Street is counting on a successful holiday shopping season.
The markets will surely dip if Congress fails to agree on an economic stimulus package before the end of the month.
A political flare-up in Argentina or another spectacular fall from corporate grace, like Enron's, could raise the specter of a financial crunch.
The markets are not yet out of the woods.
North Korea Death Rate Rises
North Koreans are dying at a rate that is more than 40 percent higher than in 1994, when the country was hit by the first of a series of devastating floods and famines, the top executive of the World Health Organization said.
The American Automobile Association estimated that car travel would constitute 87 percent of holiday trips, compared to the usual 80 percent.

At the ruins of the World Trade Center, Thanksgiving was a day to keep removing debris, to keep pouring water onto the smoldering wreckage, to keep searching intently through the rubble for anything that might be part of a body.
''I can't imagine what it's like: a loved one walks out of the house in the morning and they don't come back, and you don't even have a body to bury.
I couldn't think of a better way to spend Thanksgiving.''
The workers ate their Thanksgiving dinners at the Marriott Financial Center hotel on West Street -- just south of the site -- which has been transformed into a respite center run by the American Red Cross.
After rinsing off their dust-caked boots, they walked up the hotel's marble stairs, now covered in plastic, and past its empty front desk, which is protected by planks of plywood, to a ballroom on the second floor.
There, in overalls and hard hats, with respirator masks hanging from their necks, they sat down to eat turkey dinners off disposable plates at linen-covered tables in a chandelier-lit ballroom.
Lynn Waedekin, a nurse from Oconomowoc, Wis., walked through the room holding a wide metal basket in front of her, almost like a cigarette vendor out of a 1940's nightclub.

''I hate to say it today, but it's Tums,'' she said.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani arrived at lunchtime, put on a Red Cross cap and took up a position on the food line doling out dollops of stuffing to hungry workers.
''Is that too much?''
he asked, spooning a heap onto the plate of Lt. David Rosen, who is usually assigned to the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn.

''I know it's hard and it's very difficult, because they all want to be with their families, but at the same time there are so many families that have hope that we will be able to find the remains of their loved ones,'' the mayor said.
''I can't extend great hope, certainly not to all of them by any means, but I certainly can tell them that we'll work very, very hard to accomplish whatever we can accomplish.''
Outside, on the other side of the metal barricades that block off ground zero, people continued to leave flowers in memory of the victims.
And many people continued to look down the narrow streets of Lower Manhattan, trying to get an idea of what the 16-acre site looks like.
The city is planning to erect a viewing station so the public will be able to take in the devastation firsthand.
No site has been chosen yet for the viewing area.
''This doesn't seem like the time to go,'' he said.
Watching scoreboards in November?
When you are an Islanders fan and you have been down so long, why not roar for first place with the season barely a quarter over?
And when the Isles leap over the Rangers to get into first place, so much the better.
Before tonight's game, Coach Peter Laviolette told his players: ''Why not win tonight?
Why not wake up tomorrow in first place?''
Which is what they will do.
The Islanders have now won three straight games after a seven-game nonwinning streak slowed the fastest start in franchise history.
''This game tonight, oh, it's huge,'' Mariusz Czerkawski said.
''It feels great.''
The Islanders (14-5-2-1) needed all of goalie Chris Osgood's stunning moves to keep the Leafs out of harm's way in the opening period.
The Leafs (12-6-2-3), despite their fine overall record, are one of hockey's worst road clubs on the power play, scoring fewer than one goal in every 10 attempts.
They move quickly, form attacking lines, then have nobody in front of the net to poke in the rebound.

SLAP SHOTS
Center SHAWN BATES left the game with a groin muscle injury after scoring the opening goal.
Lawrence M. Coss ran Green Tree as chairman and chief executive, taking home $200 million in pay during the boom.
In their rush to lend, Green Tree and its rivals made loans to borrowers who had little chance of paying them back.
Tens of thousands of those people have already defaulted and have been evicted.
Conseco alone has repossessed 25,000 homes so far this year, after a record 28,466 in 2000.
By the time the industry's hangover ends later this decade, hundreds of thousands more low-income borrowers will lose their homes.
They will wind up with huge debts and ruined credit because their homes are worth far less than what they owe.
Green Tree is now Conseco Finance, the lending arm of Conseco, the financial company based in Carmel, Ind.
Mr. Coss, who did not return calls seeking comment, retired in 1998 and owns a ranch in River Falls, Wis. Gain-on-sale accounting has been relegated to the dustbin of finance.
The manufactured housing industry, meanwhile, is foundering.
Only about 180,000 new homes will be sold this year.
Factories are closing as quickly as they opened during the fat years, and tens of thousands of jobs are gone.
Dealers are shuttering, too.
In South Carolina alone, the number has fallen to less than 400 from a peak of 620 in 1998.
''You always have to follow the cash,'' he said.
THE future of Conseco, which makes loans and sells insurance mainly to middle- and low-income consumers, is also in doubt.
After buying Green Tree in 1998, the company went on its own binge under Stephen C. Hilbert, its well-paid chairman.
But facing mounting losses from bad loans and a plunging stock price, Conseco's board forced out Mr. Hilbert in April 2000 and soon replaced him with Gary C. Wendt, the former chairman of GE Capital.

This year, Conseco has cut back sharply on manufactured-home lending.
But Conseco is still saddled with $26 billion in loans on trailer homes, including more than $20 billion from the days of Mr. Hilbert and Mr. Coss.
Many top Wall Street investors, including Carl C. Icahn, the onetime corporate raider, have sold Conseco's stock short, betting that it will fall.
Losses on the trailer loans, along with problems at Conseco's insurance business, will bankrupt the company by the middle of next year, the short-sellers say.
''It's becoming clear to everybody that this game stops then, if not sooner.''
According to Conseco's own projections, it will produce only about $800 million in cash from its operations next year -- yet it has $1.4 billion in debt and interest payments and dividends coming due.
The bears say that the cash flow estimate is optimistic.
Even if it proves accurate, Conseco, which already has more than $6 billion in debt and preferred stock, may have a hard time finding enough money to make up the difference.
On Wednesday, Fitch, a bond rating agency, lowered its rating on Conseco Finance's debt to CCC, indicating ''that default is a real possibility.''
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Wendt said the company could easily meet its debt payments next year, by selling assets if necessary.
''These short-sellers have one thing in mind -- the destruction of the company,'' Mr. Wendt said.
''We have a company that employs 13,500 people, and we want to continue to have a company that employs 13,500 people.''
Last week, to bolster its case, Conseco presented investors in New York with a four-hour discussion of the company's finance business, focusing on its manufactured-home loans, which make up 60 percent of the loans on the company's books.

Bruce Crittenden, chief executive of Conseco Finance, said the trailer home business was becoming more profitable.
The interest rates that Conseco pays are falling, while the rates it charges borrowers have remained high, increasing the profit on each loan it makes.
''I believe in our model,'' Mr. Crittenden said.
But investors are unconvinced.
That is down 92 percent since Mr. Hilbert agreed to buy Green Tree in April 1998, costing the company's shareholders $18 billion.
Trailer home borrowers, mostly near the bottom of the economic ladder, often default on their loans.
It might seem odd that bond investors, who generally value safety, would buy bonds backed by such risky collateral as trailers.
But in a securitization, losses from defaulted loans are not spread equally.
Instead, the bonds are divided into ''tranches,'' and one tranche must be repaid before payment on the next can begin.
The bottom tranches are risky and pay higher interest, while the tranches that are repaid first are very safe.
Normally, banks record profits on loans only as they are repaid, whether they securitize the loans or hold them on their books.
Then the company recorded that amount as profit, even though it would not be paid for many years.

The combination of gain-on-sale and securitization meant that as long as Green Tree could find more borrowers, it could report higher profits, said Mr. Crittenden, the president of Conseco Finance.
''When you're running a gain-on-sale shop, it's based on volume,'' he said.
In September 1999, in response to pressure from investors, Conseco stopped using gain-on-sale accounting, switching to the more traditional method of booking profits only as the company is repaid.
(Ms. Weakley and two other employees in Pensacola have sued Green Tree, asserting that they were sexually harassed by a manager there.)
Many lenders made loans with as little as 5 percent down, say, $2,500 on a $50,000 home.
Dealers, who could make $10,000 or more in profit on a $50,000 home, were not shy about signing up borrowers.
If a would-be buyer could not come up with a down payment, the dealer might tell him to bring in a used gun worth $200 and buy it for $2,000, according to dealers and people in the industry.
That money would then become the down payment.

William Ryan, an analyst at Ventana Capital in New York who covers financial companies, said Green Tree cut loan standards beginning in 1995.
''These companies have a way of creating loan volume where none exists,'' Mr. Ryan said.
In 1992, it lent $1.2 billion to 43,000 borrowers for manufactured homes, accounting for about one in five trailer loans made that year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings and industry statistics.
They were an accounting fiction based on Green Tree's projections of the payments it would eventually receive, less its operating costs and its losses on repossessions.
In calculating its future profits on a loan, Green Tree needed to estimate two crucial variables: the odds that borrowers would default and the odds that they would refinance and pay off loans in advance.
Either would make the loans less profitable.
''We think at this time our assumptions are appropriate,'' Dale Redman, Green Tree's chief financial officer, said at the time of the second write-off.
During a conference call discussing the deal, Mr. Hilbert, Conseco's chairman, dismissed that possibility.
''Wall Street sometimes takes a day or two to be fully enlightened,'' he said.

CONSECO quickly discovered that many of Green Tree's borrowers could not repay their loans.
Write-offs became an annual event, totaling $554 million in 1999, $516 million in 2000 and $315 million so far this year.
Between them, Green Tree and Conseco have written down Green Tree's pretax profits by $2.3 billion over the last four years.
Add $500 million in other ''special charges'' related to Green Tree that Conseco has taken, and the write-downs wipe out all the pretax profits Green Tree and Conseco Finance earned over the last seven years.
''It's amazing to me how the shareholders of these companies actually believe the earnings per share, and they don't understand how that's accounted for,'' said Mr. Montgomery of Rocker Partners.
''The overwhelming majority of the income which is being booked is a definite maybe sometime.''
On April 28, 2000, with the company's shares at $5.63, Mr. Hilbert quit.
He received a $72 million severance package, including the right to use Conseco's private jet up to 20 times a year.
IF those write-offs seem ugly, the reality on the ground is worse.

The longer mortgages lowered monthly payments slightly, enabling lenders to make more loans.
On a typical $50,000 mortgage with a 13 percent interest rate, the monthly payment on a 15-year loan is $633, compared with $553 for a 30-year loan.
But the longer loan costs a borrower an extra $85,000 in interest over the loan's life.
In addition, the principal balance on a high-interest 30-year loan shrinks very slowly during the first few years.
After five years of payments on a $50,000, 30-year mortgage at 13 percent interest, the borrower has paid more than $32,000 in interest but still owes $49,000 in principal.
Yet unlike conventional houses, which often appreciate, manufactured homes quickly lose their value.
After three years, the wholesale value of a manufactured home is about half its retail price.
As a result, borrowers face a difficult squeeze.
They are not building equity, and if they sell their homes, they will probably find that they receive less than the amount they owe on their loans.
Mr. Gault, the dealer, said demand for new homes had collapsed partly because homeowners who would like to move to larger trailers could not.
''Once you live in a home two or three or four or five years, you want to upgrade and you can't upgrade.
You're upside-down in it big time.''
Because their homes are worth less than they owe, the owners have few options if they lose their jobs or face unexpected expenses, said Mark Tesh, credit counseling director for a nonprofit family counseling center in Greenville, S.C.
''A lot of times,'' Mr. Tesh said, ''those folks are better off just filing for bankruptcy, so they can just start fresh.''

''A lot of folks that get into the mobile home scenario, they get into it initially because it's more affordable,'' he said.
''They honestly don't realize that a mobile home is going to depreciate.
Most of them learn the hard way.''
Trailers and conventional houses now share many materials and construction techniques.
''This asset has a 50-year life minimum,'' he said.
''The manufacturers have done an outstanding job with the quality of these homes.''
Conseco, Mr. Crittenden said, also works closely with borrowers who face financial difficulty, including regularly granting loan extensions and sometimes even accepting reduced monthly payments.
Tighter loan standards may also reduce defaults.
Still, Conseco projects that it will eventually repossess about one in five of the new manufactured homes it finances.
On loans made on repossessed homes, which are aimed at even less creditworthy borrowers and can carry interest rates of 18 percent, Conseco figures on default rates of 50 percent, Mr. Crittenden said.
Those projections may comfort Wall Street, reducing investors' concerns that Conseco is underestimating its risks.
But they offer little comfort for borrowers struggling to make their monthly payments.
Bonnie and Mitchell Turner, who live near Laurens, have given up struggling.
The extra payments seemed manageable with Mrs. Turner working as a waitress and Mr. Turner as a carpenter.
''A place to retire in, hopefully.''
But within months, the furnace failed, costing $1,500 to repair.
Now Mrs. Turner has lost her job, and Mr. Turner's monthly take-home pay has fallen to about $2,000.
With four children, the family has food and clothing costs, car payments and electricity bills that total almost $1,500.
Even with their old rent of $380, the Turners' finances would be stretched to the breaking point.
''The $618 is killing us,'' Mrs. Turner said.
''We just can't do it.''
The Turners, who stopped paying their mortgage in August, are waiting for Conseco to repossess their home.
Mrs. Turner said she hopes the company won't foreclose until after Christmas.
But getting rid of the fungus is not an option.
The fungus protects the fescue against all manner of disease; in exchange, the fungus -- which grows between the plant's cells and which is not visible to the naked eye -- gets food and shelter from the plant.
Try to break up this cozy friendship, and it ''opens up a Pandora's box for the plant,'' Professor Allen said.
''If you get rid of the fungus, the fescue is exposed to a lot of stress,'' she said.

In researching the disease, Dr. Saker and her colleagues discovered that the animals were deficient in copper.
Speculating that a copper deficiency might trigger the toxicosis, they first tried administering a copper bolus.
''Essentially it's a big old capsule that you shove down their throat and it sits in their stomach and breaks down over time,'' she said.

The fortified forage, it turns out, is full of antioxidants like copper, vitamins C and E, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase.
''The turf work has shown repeatedly that we're getting this increased antioxidant activity and our suspicion -- we don't have direct proof of this -- is that this is what is affecting the animals' immunity,'' Professor Allen said.
According to that research, the blood samples taken at different periods showed increased immunity for seaweed-nourished cattle.
These findings may have big commercial repercussions.
This month, Professor Allen and Dr. Saker and colleagues received patent 6,312,709, which is the third patent to be issued covering this seaweed supplementation.
Several more patents are pending and the entire patent portfolio has been licensed to Acadian Sea Plants Ltd., based in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.
''They have been field-testing this extensively in two large commercial feedlot operations and we're very close to getting a significant market for this,'' said Walter Haeussler, director of technology transfer and intellectual property for Texas Tech, which along with Virginia Tech owns the technology.
''We've had to do a lot of research to determine the correct dosage and timing of feeding of seaweed to cattle to get certain effects.
If you give too much you can actually get less than maximum benefit.
It's not a matter of 'if a little bit works then a lot works better.'
''
Dr. Saker speculated that the seaweed would not only make the cattle healthier but might also result in beef that is rich in antioxidants and thus more healthful for consumers.
''We're making the assumption that if it can happen in cattle it can happen in poultry, in swine, in eggs and in milk,'' she said.
Does this research mean that health-conscious Americans should themselves start bingeing on seaweed, which is a common ingredient in Asian diets?
''This has very potent physiological effects, whether it's a plant or an animal,'' Professor Allen said.
''But we've got to know more about the long-term impact before we recommend it to a human being.
There are many different types of seaweeds -- brown, red and green seaweeds -- just as there are many different kinds of dogs or trees.
Will other seaweeds do it?
We don't know, because we haven't had the opportunity to test them.''
The settings seem highly variable in Dave Holland's quintet: time appears in odd meters, or shifting from twos to fours and fives, in funk that becomes swing.
Short cyclical themes suddenly sprout into longer, harmonized passages that twist off into melodies and twist again into improvisations, from which the soloist suddenly drops out.
But guiding it all is a control that is almost unparalleled in jazz at the moment.
It is a bona fide small-band music, as opposed to a music of individual players.
The lineup of the current quintet, which opened a four-night run at Birdland on Wednesday, has kept steady through two albums and a forthcoming live album.
It's got a sound and a signature rhythmic feeling.
The group is defined by vamps, that old device from the blues that evolved through Ahmad Jamal and Miles Davis and Coltrane and Latin music to become, today, one of the jazz bandleader's best tools.
It allows for maximum freedom while holding down the center; it sounds ancient while letting in all the rhythms and phrase-shapes of the moment.
Mr. Holland, as bassist and bandleader, is deeply settled into his role as keeper of the vamps.
The music swirls around him; he keeps calm, creating an atmosphere of serenity at the middle of it.
Not to say he doesn't go beyond that when it's time to solo.
All members of the band write for it, but the tunes come out sounding terrifically unified; it's a band with roles.
In a sense, too, it's an all-percussion band: each of the five players, including Mr. Kilson, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, the saxophonist Chris Potter and the trombonist Robin Eubanks, takes a turn contributing to the great interlocking rhythmic structures.
The contrasts come with the outbursts of improvisation, especially Mr. Kilson's, which are explosive.
But they are solos that always develop shrewdly and feed back into the design.
The surprising drawback of a band this well conceptualized is that the concept can override the song; sometimes individual pieces are hard to remember.
But it's music vibrating with assurance, tough and built to last.
An influential member of the Federal Reserve said today that it should not shy away from continuing to ease monetary policy aggressively just because its benchmark interest rate is beginning to approach zero.
Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor whose expertise in economic forecasting often helps shape the debate within the central bank, said the economy should ''gradually strengthen'' next year, and he did not say whether the Fed would cut rates for an 11th time this year at its next scheduled meeting on Dec. 11.
But Mr. Meyer said it would be a mistake to rule out further rate cuts in an effort to preserve the flexibility to reduce rates should the economy not recover or encounter an unexpected shock like another terrorist attack.
Mr. Meyer also said the outlook for a quick recovery would be tempered somewhat if Congress and the Bush administration cannot agree on a fiscal stimulus package in coming weeks.

The Fed has already cut its benchmark federal funds target rate 10 times this year, by a total of 4.5 percentage points, leaving it at a 40-year low of 2 percent.
Some economists have expressed concern that further rate cuts in coming months could lead the Fed to shoot off the last of its ammunition before the recession has run its course, leaving the central bank largely powerless should the downturn prove to be longer or deeper than anticipated.

''Does this mean the Fed should 'keep its powder dry,' as some have argued, holding back on further easing in case the downturn turns out to be more serious or in case there are additional adverse shocks?''
''I believe such a strategy would be misguided -- indeed the reverse of what would be appropriate.''
The issue has been of concern to economists because of the experience of Japan, which has pushed official short-term rates almost to zero, and now has few monetary policy tools to battle its stubborn, decade-long economic downturn.
Mr. Meyer, who has said he will not seek reappointment to his Fed seat when his term expires in January, said the right strategy for the Fed would be to continue moving quickly to cut rates if the economy required it, ''substituting speed of the move for the cumulative size of the easing.''
As one of the Fed's most aggressive inflation fighters, Mr. Meyer has never been known for advocating rapid-fire rate cuts.
The Fed typically seeks a negative real fed funds rate in trying to nurse the economy out of recession.
''In the worst case, as in Japan today, inflation might turn to deflation, limiting the ability to lower the real policy rate even to zero,'' he said.
One tank holding 6,000 gallons of fuel was in the building to provide power to the command bunker on the 23rd floor.

Engineers and other experts have already uncovered evidence at the collapse site suggesting that some type of fuel played a significant role in the building's demise, but they expect to spend months piecing together the picture of what remains a disturbing puzzle.
''They say, 'We know what happened at 1 and 2, but why did 7 come down?'
''
Engineers said that here and across the country, diesel-powered generators are used in buildings like hospitals and trading houses, where avoiding power outages is crucial.
''It's just like when you investigate a plane crash,'' said Dr. Barnett, a professor of fire protection engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
''If we find a weakness in the building or a deficiency in the building that causes that collapse, we then want to find that weakness in other buildings and fix it.''
Sprayed on the steel, almost like imitation snow in holiday decorations, was a layer of fireproofing material, generally less than an inch thick.
Although the fireproofing was intended to withstand ordinary fires for at least two hours, experts said buildings the size of 7 World Trade Center that are treated with such coatings have never collapsed in a fire of any duration.
Most of three other buildings in the complex, 4, 5 and 6 World Trade, stood despite suffering damage of all kinds, including fire.
Still, experts concede, in a hellish day, 7 World Trade might have sustained structural injuries never envisioned in fire codes.
That day began with flaming pieces of steel and aluminum and, horribly, human bodies raining around the building.

With the collapse of both towers by 10:30 a.m., larger pieces of the twin towers had smashed parts of 7 World Trade and set whole clusters of floors ablaze.
It fell in the late afternoon, hampering rescue efforts and hurling its beams into the ground like red-hot spears.
But some experts said that like the jet fuel in the twin towers, the diesel fuel could have played a role in the collapse of 7 World Trade.

Dr. Barnett and Mr. Baker are part of an assessment team organized by the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to examine the performance of several buildings during the attacks.
If further studies of the debris confirm the findings of extremely high temperature, Dr. Barnett said, ''the smoking gun would be the fuel.''
Because of those doubts, engineers hold open the possibility that the collapse had other explanations, like damage caused by falling debris or another source of heat.

Francis E. McCarton, a spokesman for the emergency management office, confirmed that assessment.
''Yes, it was used for our generating system.''
''I'm sure that with enough heat it would have burned,'' Mr. Hauer said of the diesel.
''The question is whether the collapse caused the tank to rupture, or whether the material hitting the building caused the tank to rupture and enhance the fire.''
A combination of an uncontrolled fire and the structural damage might have been able to bring the building down, some engineers said.
But that would not explain steel members in the debris pile that appear to have been partly evaporated in extraordinarily high temperatures, Dr. Barnett said.
''Any structure anywhere in the world, if you put it in these conditions, it will not stand,'' Mr. Marcus said.
''The buildings are not designed to be a torch.''
But the Bank of Japan, whose short-term interest rates are already effectively at zero, decided to take no further action today to ease monetary policy.
As a result, production has been running below last year's levels since March.
Most analysts expect the recession, Japan's fourth in 10 years, to continue at least through the third quarter of 2002.
''The bottom is nowhere in sight,'' said Ryo Hino, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo.
Slashed output is translating into slashed jobs at manufacturers ranging from Isuzu Motors to Fujitsu to Kobe Steel.
Economists expect Friday's unemployment report to show a rate exceeding the postwar high of 5.4 percent posted in October.

Job losses and pay cuts are also expected to bite into consumer spending; the government is due to release October figures on Friday.

''What's weighing on Mr. Suzuki is that he might be the next one to go and, if he stays, he gets a pay cut,'' Mr. Hino said.
The public still has faith in the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who has promised to shore up government finances by slashing public spending.
The muddled message has led lawmakers to step up calls on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy further.
''I was fairly tolerant at first, but it's getting ridiculous,'' Mr. Kyl, Republican of Arizona, said.
''It'll now clearly be after the first of the year, and it's causing a significant disruption of our ability to function.
We were rolling with it just fine for a couple of weeks.
But then it drug into three and then four, and this is getting old.''

Tonight, workers under the direction of the Environmental Protection Agency are to begin fumigating Senator Tom Daschle's office, where a letter containing highly potent powdery anthrax was opened on Oct. 15.
Officials say they hope that the building can reopen in two to four weeks.
But no one knows for sure.
The E.P.A.
administrator, Christie Whitman, acknowledged in testimony to a skeptical Appropriations subcommittee this week that ''we are writing the book as we go along.''
The cleanup has been repeatedly delayed, not only by testing to determine the extent of contamination and by the painstaking requirements of the criminal investigation, but also by uncertainty over just how to eradicate potentially deadly anthrax spores.
When senators and their aides left the building at the close of business on Oct. 17, most must have thought that they would be back in a few days.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, has breached the barricades twice, first to leave food tablets for his three goldfish and one suckerfish that ''are now being fed by men in moon suits,'' he said, and then to retrieve one must-have item for each aide.
The senators have been without mail or parcel deliveries for weeks and are relying on e-mail and their own Web sites to retrieve files and past testimony on important issues.

Ms. Stabenow and a Democratic colleague, Barbara Boxer of California, sought solace in song, performing a parody, ''We gotta have Hart'' (to the tune of ''Heart'' from ''Damn Yankees'') at a Democratic caucus lunch on Tuesday.
This was one verse:
We're not being mean
Just can't wait for that chlorine
Just get back to work the president says
But face it, it's difficult to start
So we gotta have Hart.
''It came from a feeling, I guess, that we can't control the situation and that we should do our best to keep a positive outlook,'' Ms. Stabenow said.
In fact, the gravity of the anthrax threat and the complexities of the cleanup have worn the patience and frayed the tempers of worried senators and their staffs.
''There are no standards, senator,'' Dr. Koplan replied.
''It's hard to set them in the absence of scientific information.''
''Everybody's in charge of a bit of this.
We need to be safe rather than sorry, and we need to have very clear criteria for how clean is safe.''
Richard Rupert, the on-scene coordinator for the E.P.A.
at the Hart cleanup and a veteran of oil spills and transportation accidents, said: ''Our goal is to achieve perfection.
But as we all know, that doesn't happen too frequently.''
Before the fumigation of Mr. Daschle's suite, hundreds of test strips containing a nonlethal form of bacteria will be placed in nooks and crannies to determine how extensively the gas penetrates the area.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In the fumigation, two mobile E.P.A.
labs will circle the building, taking measurements to monitor for leaks.
After the chlorine is pumped into the office through sealed chemically resistant pipes, it will be replaced with sodium metabisulfite gas, which turns the chlorine into harmless table salt.
''The only thing we found it does is that on Naugahyde chairs it tends to degrade the surface a little bit,'' Mr. Rupert said.
Whenever the building does reopen, at least some junior senators say they hope that they may also get to keep the small offices in the Capitol itself that they have been assigned temporarily -- a privilege usually reserved for senior members.
''I've been trying to figure out how we do that,'' Ms. Stabenow conceded.
We should be wary, in fact, of ever attaching too much importance to any single event.
In his great novel, ''The Man Without Qualities,'' Robert Musil dismissed the idea that history moves in a straight line like a billiard ball, changing direction only when struck.
That quality is what makes it impossible to predict where exactly we will be 10 years from now.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Yet Musil's analogy of history and clouds illuminates something else.
Though the weather is hard to forecast, the range of possible weathers is not infinitely large.
It may not rain tomorrow, but we know that if it does, it will rain water, not boiling oil.
It may not be quite as warm as yesterday, but we know that it will not be minus 50 degrees.
In just the same way, the attacks on New York and Washington, however shocking, did not alter the direction of several underlying historical trends.
In many respects the world will not be so very different in 2011 from the world as it would have evolved under the influence of those trends, even had the attacks not happened.
The first deep trend is obvious enough: the spread of terrorism -- that is to say the use of violence by nonstate organizations in the pursuit of extreme political goals -- to the United States.
This kind of terrorism has been around for quite a while.
Hijacking planes is certainly not new: since the late 1960's, when the tactic first began to be used systematically by the Palestine Liberation Organization and its sympathizers, there have been some 500 hijackings.
As for the tactic of flying planes directly at populous targets, what else were the 3,913 Japanese pilots doing who killed themselves and many more American servicemen flying kamikaze missions in 1944 and 1945?
Between 1995 and 2000, according to State Department figures, there were more than 2,100 international terrorist attacks.
But just 15 of them occurred in North America, causing just seven casualties.
A novelty, yes, but hardly a surprise.
Terrorism had been a fact of life in major cities around the world -- including New York's elder sister London -- for decades.
Put it this way: if economics could be globalized, why not political violence?
The two are in fact connected.
Year after year it becomes easier for small bands of fanatics to perpetrate mass destruction because the means of destruction get cheaper and more readily available.
In the same way, the real cost of a nuclear warhead -- and certainly the real cost of a kiloton of nuclear yield -- is lower today than at any time since the Manhattan Project achieved its goal.
Converted into 2001 prices, that figure rises roughly tenfold, which is enough to buy more than 400 Trident II missiles.
(Let's face it: if nukes were expensive, Pakistan wouldn't have them.)
It seems reasonable to assume that the same process has reduced the cost of biological weapons like refined anthrax.
The bad news is that no amount of warfare against the states that harbor terrorists will rule out further attacks.
The Western European experience of combating leftist and nationalist terrorism shows that the real war against terrorism has to be fought on the home front by domestic intelligence agencies, police forces and humdrum security guards around all potential targets.
So, welcome to the world of the daily security check, the fortnightly bomb scare and the annual explosion.
Ten years from now, New York firefighters and Washington postal workers will feel the same weary resignation that Londoners developed during the I.R.A.
's bombing campaign.

The second trend that Sept. 11 did nothing to change is the economic downturn.
Yet so far, the deflation of the late 1990's asset price bubble has been a gentle affair compared with the cataclysmic meltdown that followed the bubble of the 1920's.
To give some orders of magnitude, a crash on the 1929-32 scale would take the Dow down from over 11,723 -- where it stood at its peak in January last year -- to about 1,266 by November next year.
In this light, the most striking thing about the economic consequences of Sept. 11 would seem to be their insignificance.
A 3 percent drop in the Dow is nothing.
Oil prices, too, have continued their yearlong decline.
And there has been virtually no movement in long-term interest rates, which might have been expected at a time of increased political risk.
Nevertheless, the world economy has two serious economic weaknesses -- also predating Sept. 11 -- that cannot be ignored.
The first is the nonglobal nature of globalization.
Far from being perfectly integrated, the world's markets for goods, capital and labor appear to have become remarkably segmented.
Thus, the overwhelming bulk of American, Canadian and Mexican trade now takes place within the North American Free Trade Area, just as most European trade takes place within Europe.
Labor mobility is also distorted, with the United States able to cherry-pick the best-qualified and most-talented workers from European and Asian economies under its various visa programs while letting in many more unskilled (and untaxed) Latino workers through the Mexican back door.
This is one key reason that the process we call globalization has tended to result in widening inequality between nations.
If there was a substantial measure of convergence of incomes during the first age of globalization, in this age there is a pronounced divergence.
And such inequality seems likely to increase the resentment felt in poorer countries toward the super-rich United States.
(That said, we should not make the mistake of assuming that this poverty is the principal cause of support for organizations like Al Qaeda, most of whose recruits come from relatively prosperous backgrounds.)
Even more worrying is the medium-term outlook for global energy supplies.
The rise of the S.U.V.
as a status symbol shows how complacent Americans are about their supply of oil and petroleum.
They should not be.
True, oil prices are low right now: a barrel of West Texas crude sells for about $20, less than half the price (in real terms) as at the peak of the oil crisis in 1982.
It's no great stretch to imagine something similar happening again.
The realities are stark.
The Middle East accounts for 31 percent of world oil production but just 6 percent of consumption.
North America accounts for about 18 percent of world oil production but consumes 30 percent.
Even more sobering, however, are the figures for world oil reserves: North America has just 6 percent of them; the Middle East 65 percent.
Feeling comfortable?
Total U.S. energy consumption -- of which petroleum accounts for about two-fifths -- has risen about 27 percent since 1972, while oil reserves have fallen by about 30 percent.
Right now, the United States depends on the Persian Gulf -- mainly Saudi Arabia -- for about 12 percent of its oil imports, but that figure is bound to rise as OPEC countries account for an ever-increasing share of the world's available oil.

The time frame may be much tighter than S.U.V.
manufacturers realize.
Kenneth S. Deffeyes of Princeton University predicts that global oil production will start to decline from 2004.
At a conference at the Royal United Services Institute in London in October, experts warned that from 2008 supplies of non-OPEC oil will fall steeply -- reaching close to zero in 2040 -- and that, barring some major technological breakthroughs, there will be an effective world shortage from 2010.

Yet even that estimate could prove to be overoptimistic if there is a regime change in Saudi Arabia.
Like ''the coming oil crisis,'' the fall of the Saudi monarchy has been prophesied so often that many people have stopped believing it could ever happen.
Don't be so sure.
The position of the ruling dynasty increasingly resembles that of the shah of Iran in the late 1970's.
Low oil prices may have been good for the West, but they have produced a significant fall in per capita income in Saudi Arabia, creating a reserve army of disenchanted young men who are the natural recruits of Al Qaeda.
Make no mistake: radical Islam -- especially the Wahhabist strain found in Saudi Arabia -- is a revolutionary movement that has set the Middle East ablaze before now (in the 1880's for example, when a Sudanese holy man calling himself the ''Mahdi,'' or ''expected guide,'' emerged as the Victorian Osama bin Laden).
A revolution in Saudi Arabia would be as traumatic a blow to the world economy as the Iranian revolution of 1979.
The days of the S.U.V.
-- perhaps even the days of the internal-combustion engine -- are therefore numbered.
American car manufacturers have less than a decade to come up with an alternative and affordable energy source to gasoline.
If they fail, the world economy could well find itself reliving the stagflation of the 1970's.
There is a third trend that has been at work for more than a decade: the transition of American global power from informal to formal imperialism.
Since 1945, the United States has largely been content to exercise influence around the world indirectly: exercising economic leverage through multinational corporations and international agencies like the International Monetary Fund and political power through ''friendly'' indigenous regimes.
As Britain discovered in the 19th century, however, there are limits to what can be achieved by informal imperialism.
Revolutions can overthrow the puppet rulers.
New regimes can default on their debts, disrupt trade, go to war with their neighbors -- even sponsor terrorism.
Slowly and rather unreflectively, the United States has been responding to crises of this sort by intervening directly in the internal affairs of faraway countries.
True, it has tended to do so behind a veil of multilateralism, acting in the name of the United Nations or NATO.
But the precedents set in Bosnia and Kosovo are crucial.
Since the United States and Britain went to war against Afghanistan -- with the avowed intention of replacing the Taliban regime -- I have found myself quoting Rudyard Kipling on ''the White Man's Burden,'' particularly those lines (written just over a century ago) that enjoined Americans to fight what he called ''the savage wars of peace'' while at the same time filling ''full the mouth of Famine.''
(Kipling would certainly have grasped the rationale of simultaneously dropping cluster bombs and food parcels.)
Of course, no one today would be so politically incorrect as to call governing Afghanistan ''the White Man's Burden.''
Even in his messianic speech at the Labor Party conference in October, British Prime Minister Tony Blair talked innocuously about ''partnership,'' ''the politics of globalization'' and ''reordering this world.''

There are good reasons to wonder how readily Americans will assume the Victorian burden, of course.
The strengths of the U.S. economy may not be the strengths of a natural imperial hegemon.
The British Empire relied on an enormous export of capital and people, but since 1972 the American economy has been a net importer of capital (to the tune of 15 percent of G.D.P.
last year), and the United States remains the favored destination of immigrants from around the world, not a producer of would-be colonial emigrants.
Moreover, Britain in its heyday was able to draw on a culture of unabashed imperialism dating back to the Elizabethan period.
The United States -- born in a war against the British Empire -- will always be a reluctant ruler of other peoples.
But reluctance isn't the same as renunciation.
And the obvious lesson the United States can draw from the British experience of formal empire is that the world's most successful economy can do a very great deal to impose its preferred values on less technologically advanced societies.
It is nothing short of astonishing that Great Britain was able to govern about a quarter of the world's population and land surface -- and to control nearly all of its sea lanes -- without running up an especially large defense bill (an average of just 3 percent of net national product between 1870 and 1913, lower for the rest of the 19th century).
And today the United States is vastly wealthier relative to the rest of the world than Britain ever was.
Nor should anybody pretend that, at least in fiscal terms, the cost of expanding the American empire -- even if it meant a great many little wars like the one in Afghanistan -- would be prohibitive.
I have not yet raised one trend, much commented on -- the supposedly inescapable ''clash'' between a democratic West and an intolerant Islam.
From this viewpoint, Sept. 11 was a moment of revelation rather than redirection, as America belatedly woke up to a struggle the Muslim world has been fighting for years.
I don't buy this.
Primarily that's because the most striking features of modern Islam are its amazing heterogeneity and geographical dispersion.
Violence between ethnic or religious groups is not dividing the world into great blocs.
As we have already seen in the Balkans (where we were inclined to side with the Muslims, don't forget), the tendency is for existing political units to fragment.
So any clash of civilizations will occur not on conventional battlefields but in the streets of multicultural states like Bosnia -- or even cities like Bradford in England, where gangs of Muslim youths rioted last summer.
Think of it as deglobalization: for one of the great paradoxes of our time is that the economic integration of the world has coincided with its political disintegration.
Excluding sub-Saharan Africa, there were 64 independent countries in the world in 1871.
But since World War II, there have been sustained increases.
In this context, the main significance of movements like Islamic fundamentalism may lie in their centrifugal as opposed to centripetal effects.
Rather than anticipating a clash between monolithic civilizations, we should expect a continued process of political disintegration as religious and ethnic conflicts challenge the integrity of existing multicultural nation-states.
Civil war has, after all, been the most frequent kind of war since 1945: something like two-thirds of all postwar conflicts have been within rather than between states.
From Yugoslavia to Iraq to Afghanistan, what the United States keeps having to confront is not a united Islam but a succession of fractured polities, racked by internecine war.
(The same could be said about Somalia, Sierra Leone and Rwanda.)
Why has economic globalization coincided with political fragmentation in this contradictory fashion?
One possible answer is that globalized market forces increase regional inequalities within traditional nation-states.
Another is that the superficial homogenization of popular culture -- through Hollywood, the pop-music industry and the Anglicization of technical communication -- promotes an accentuation of parochial identities as a kind of a reaction.
But the best answer may be that as more and more ethnically heterogeneous countries adopt (with American encouragement) the combination of economic openness and political democracy, their rationale simply falls away.
Central government loses its legitimacy as the planner of the economy, and ethnic minorities vote for separatist parties.
These, then, are the four deep trends shaping the early 21st century.
First, the globalization of terrorism.
Second, the approach of a second energy crisis.
Third, the formalization of American imperialism.
And finally, the fragmentation of the multicultural polity.

What are the implications for the world of Sept. 11, 2011?
With the caveat that this is only one of a number of possible futures, let me repeat my earlier predictions.
Terrorism will be a part of everyday life.
Meanwhile, American troops will be patrolling both Kabul and Kosovo.
And the divisions between ethnic and religious groups in the United States -- indeed throughout the world -- will be even more pronounced.
So much for the bad news.
The good news?
There will be fewer S.U.V.
's clogging up the streets.
Let me conclude with a fifth prediction.
Most people will regard all of these things as direct consequences of the terrorist attacks 10 years before.
Indeed, The New York Times Magazine will carry an article saying that Sept. 11, 2001, was one of the great turning points of modern history.
Wrong.
The unpalatable truth is that it would all have happened anyway.
President Fernando de la Rúa ordered that bank account withdrawals could not exceed $250 a week for the next 90 days.
For needs beyond that, payments can be made by check or credit card.

He also limited transfers abroad in a decree he signed without consulting Congress.
''Argentina has been subjected to speculative attacks by people who seek to benefit from a devaluation of our currency,'' said Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo.
''These measures will serve to preserve the savings of Argentines.''
Opposition politicians attacked the moves as an authoritarian act by a tottering government that may be planning to confiscate accounts to pay its bills.
Mr. De la Rúa's decree stopped short of ordering the conversion of peso accounts into dollars, reversing earlier statements by senior officials.
But economists noted that depositors now have every reason to trade their peso savings into dollars, in what is most likely the first step toward dropping the peso as the currency altogether in favor of the dollar.
Panama and Ecuador already use the dollar as their currencies, and El Salvador and Guatemala make it easy for people to spend dollars sent by relatives living in the United States.
But the adoption of the dollar by Argentina, with its 36 million people and sizable economy, would have widespread implications, perhaps even presaging the eventual acceptance of the dollar by the entire region as a common currency in the decades to come, much as Europe has accepted the euro.

As it appeared increasingly likely that the fund would withhold the money for at least a month, economists worried that the government would not be able to meet its foreign debt obligations.

In recent weeks, the government has been working to persuade lenders to swap upward of $95 billion in bonds for new ones that pay far lower interest rates.
Several credit agencies in the United States have assailed the plan, saying it is tantamount to the largest default of any country in history.
Compounding the government's problems was a stunning defeat on Thursday that appeared to signal that the opposition Justicialist Party was abandoning its policy of helping the government through the crisis.
The newly elected Senate appointed Senator Ramón Puerta, a Justicialist, as president of the chamber, in effect making him the country's vice president.
As the new second official in the line of succession, Mr. Puerta will be acting president and have the power of executive decree when Mr. De la Rúa is abroad.
The Justicialists appear divided about how hard they want to push the government.
But Mr. De la Rúa's critics say he has consistently shown an inability to lead, and his cabinet appears to be in a constant state of division and disarray, leading to concerns that the president will not be able to complete the final two years of his term.
Many political analysts believe that his resignation is likely if there is a cessation of debt payments, which would make Senator Puerta interim president until new elections are held.

In the short term, the limitation on bank withdrawals could slow spending at a time when the economy is already shrinking fast.
Now in its fourth year of recession, the economy has suffered sharp declines in industrial production, consumption and tax receipts in the last four months.
As a stimulus for consumption, Mr. De la Rúa's decree allows people to spend whatever they like using their credit and debit cards.
Consumers will pay much-reduced sales taxes when they use debit cards, an added incentive to purchase goods in a way that will create tax revenue for the government.
Argentines are accustomed to buying mostly in cash in large part to evade paying taxes.
Consumers will also will be able to write checks to purchase items, but whoever cashes that check will then be limited in withdrawing $250 a week from their account on that money.
''The probability that people will not see their deposits again is very high,'' said José Luis Espert, a noted economist.
''Without doubt, the economic implosion will now accelerate.''
''I'm looking for a reasonably robust recovery that will surprise people with its speed and magnitude,'' Mr. Shepherdson said.

Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis, said economic growth should resume in the first quarter of next year.
''Our forecast is for what would be called a V-shaped recovery,'' he said, referring to the prospect that the downturn that began in March will be followed by a strong upturn soon.
They suggested that the economy might end up being more sluggish than recent statistics suggest.
Before Sept. 11, many Fed officials were predicting that the economy was on the verge of stabilizing if not recovering.
On the plus side, the officials pointed to shrinking inventories, low energy prices, a rebound in the stock market, relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of the interest rate cuts and tax reductions already in the pipeline.
And there was fresh evidence today that the economy might be close to bottoming out.
But most Fed officials remain worried that any rebound will be weak, at least initially.
The main force inhibiting a strong comeback, Fed officials say, is the perception among businesses that the rates of return available to them from investing in new equipment remain too low given the uncertainty about demand for their products, the overall health of the economy and the risks associated with the campaign against terrorism.
In this view, the economy will not begin rolling again until capital investment rebounds.
But it fell off sharply starting last year, both a victim and a cause of a general reassessment of the potential for technology to improve business efficiency and profitability.

To the degree that businesses choose to trim capital spending in the face of economic risk and uncertainty, lower interest rates do not help much.
Instead, Fed officials said, the return to more normal levels of capital spending will come about steadily -- but slowly -- as demand picks up and terrorism-inspired fear and risk diminish.

''High-tech equipment investment at elevated rates of return will, most likely, resume once very high uncertainty premiums recede to more normal levels,'' Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress in October.
Investors are betting that the Fed will reduce its benchmark interest rate once more next week, to 1.75 percent from 2 percent.
But investors are also betting that the Fed will reverse course next year and push its federal funds target rate up starting in late winter as the economy gains strength.
But the question of how soon the Fed will start raising rates again turns on how soon the recovery starts and how strong any turnaround will be.
Fed officials are more cautious on that score than some other economists, including those inside the Bush administration.
As a general matter, Mr. Hubbard said, ''any capital overhang is likely to have been eliminated by the weak investment performance in 2001.''
-------------------- Remarks by Greenspan
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 (Reuters) -- Terrorism poses a challenge to the gains made by increasingly close global economic ties, Alan Greenspan reiterated today.
''If we allow terrorism to undermine our freedom of action, we could reverse at least part of the palpable gains achieved by postwar globalization,'' he said.
''It is incumbent upon us not to allow that to happen.''
The Housing Development Finance Corporation said it was discussing takeovers with several of its rivals as it tries to retain its position as the nation's leading home lender.
Household Development is reportedly in talks with Tata Homefinance Limited, part owned by Abbey National P.L.C.
of Britain, and several other companies to take over their business.
The home loans sector has bucked the slowdown in other sectors, helped by falling interest rates and tax breaks.

Turning to clothes, Mrs. Kojima used new Japanese slang words derived from English: bahgen, wintah saro, summah saro, recykuru shoppu, and frea marketo.

Big-ticket items like a new car are out of the question.
''I don't feel like buying a car,'' she said while riding in the family's five-year-old Nissan.
Americans, of course, have also been cutting back, and consumer confidence is anything but high.
In Japan, by contrast, where near zero interest rates are the norm, car sales fell by 20 percent, hitting a 25-year low for the month of October.
Awash with money, banks have seen their lending fall for 46 straight months.
As consumer demand languishes, Japan's low interest rates amount to pushing on a string.
Despite appearances of peace and tranquillity, exemplified by Mrs. Kojima's delicate flower arrangement in the front foyer, the rude winds of recession and economic insecurity are prompting the Kojimas, like so many other Japanese families, to batten down the hatches.
Consumer pessimism is one central reason the Japanese economy seems impervious to more than a decade of failed government remedies.
Conservatism partly stems from the fact that 65 percent of Japanese savings assets are held by people over 65 years of age.
For young people, spending is crimped by anxiety about the future, a syndrome economists call ''the fear factor.''
Anxiety reigns despite the fact that nearly 95 percent of Japanese who want to work have jobs.
Mrs. Kojima's husband, Shuichi, a 55-year-old electrical engineer, has seen lifetime employment guarantees fray after spending all his working life at one company.
''My husband's company has been forcefully restructuring over the last four years,'' she said.
It is getting extremely hard to get a job.''
With two sons in college, Mrs. Kojima took a part-time job last year, caring for severely disabled adults.

A family friend, Toshiko Suzuki, recounted her own daughter's job search last spring, when she was finishing college.
Looking back to the roaring growth years of the 70's and 80's, she said, ''We never expected that there would be restructuring everywhere, that the economy would get so bad.''
Japan's unemployment rate has hit 5.4 percent, a postwar high.
The labor market is particularly unforgiving with older jobless workers.

Over all in Japan there are about two job applicants for each job.
But, because of age segregation, about seven job seekers over 55 compete for each opening in that bracket.
With the International Monetary Fund predicting that Japan's economy will shrink by nearly 1 percent this year -- and by 1.3 percent next year -- union leaders are desperately trying to hold on to jobs.
To do so, they advocate job sharing and cuts in salaries, bonuses and work hours.
''I feel in my bones that the jobless rate and the ratio of job offers to job seekers will worsen in the next two or three months,'' Chikara Sakaguchi, Japan's labor minister, said.
Japanese people share this fear.
With Japan sliding into its fourth recession in a decade, 72 percent of almost 1,500 adults polled last month said they feared that they or family members would lose their jobs over the next year, according to the Nippon Research Institute, a government-backed group.
With 67 percent of respondents saying they expect the economy to deteriorate further in the next year, the institute said this consumer anxiety index was at its highest level since polling started in 1977.

In a separate survey, 40 percent of more than 3,000 respondents said they were cutting personal spending.
In addition, 80 percent felt job insecurity, according to the survey, conducted for the Bank of Japan.
Nervous about the present, Mrs. Kojima is also nervous about the day five years down the road when her husband is to retire.
They are not alone.
In 2020, one-quarter of Japan's population will be over 65.
Mrs. Suzuki, whose husband may retire soon, said: ''We worry about our old age.
If we live to be 90 years old, the national pension system will not take be able to support us.''
Indeed, a government policy paper has even suggested cutting social security benefits by 20 percent, starting in 2005.
Displaying a lack of confidence in Japan's fixed contribution pension system, Japanese in 1999 saved 11 percent of their incomes.
A question mark hangs over the pension system as the level of government indebtedness has risen to more than 130 percent of gross domestic product -- by far the highest ratio of any industrialized economy.
Given these uncertainties, the Kojimas, like most Japanese families, choose to save rather than invest, even though interest rates are so low the earnings over a year do not even cover bank machine charges if one withdrawal is made each month.
On a deposit of $8,130, Mrs. Kojima says she makes $4.06.
''That is peanuts,'' she said.
But other investments are too risky.
Since 1990, the yen has been one of the most volatile currencies in the industrialized world, wiping out gains in foreign investments.
Over the same time, a line graph of Tokyo's stock market looks like a bare-knuckle bobsled run down Mount Fuji.
Darkening the nation's outlook, the government also sharply shifted downward the second-quarter drop to 1.2 percent, from 0.7 percent, making for an annualized rate of 4.8.
With the figures released today, the world's two largest economies -- the United States and Japan -- are in recession.
And Germany, the third largest, is expected to follow.
The data follow a procession of statistics that point to a hard winter in Japan.
And the trade surplus is forecast to drop 40 percent this fiscal year, which ends in March.

''The current economic downturn could end up being Japan's worst ever,'' Mikihiro Matsuoka, an economist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo, warned recently.
That assessment was echoed in New York by the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a private research group that studies 26 economic indicators for Japan, many dating back to the 1950's.
''They are set up to have their worst recession on record,'' Laksman Achuthan, managing director of the institute, said in an interview on Thursday.
''This one will beat the mid-1970's recession, and that one was related to the oil shock.''
My fear is a constant economic corrosion.''

Economic shrinkage or stagnation will bedevil Japan through early 2004, according to a forecast released this week by Japan's Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, a government group headed by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
But in the last two weeks, the three major ratings agencies have downgraded Japan's government bonds to the lowest levels of the major industrialized countries.
Japan is largely immune to foreign investor nervousness about its bonds because it is a net creditor and because about 95 percent of the bonds are held by Japanese investors.
But the downgradings expose a serious weakness of the Japanese economy.
In the 1990's, Japan's national debt more than doubled, but lowered interest rates have allowed debt service payments to hover around 10.4 trillion yen (now $8.5 billion) for the last 15 years.
Today, however, tax receipts are shrinking, making borrowing increasingly costly.
Japanese government bond prices ''are a ticking time bomb,'' David Roche, a London-based investment adviser, wrote recently, predicting that interest rates will rise and bond prices will fall, further eroding the weak assets of Japan's troubled banks.
If poor credit ratings cause interest rates to rise from their rock-bottom levels, Japan could start feeling the cost of a decade of heavy borrowing.

''If ratings go on skidding, it might trigger plunges in government bond prices, thus inducing a state of the economy similar to a depression,'' Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations, said on Wednesday.
Since October of last year, the unemployment rate, which is adjusted to take account of normal seasonal variations, has risen from 3.9 percent, a 30-year low, to its highest point now in more than six years.

''Today's unemployment numbers are troubling, and they underscore that we must act to ensure America's economic security,'' President Bush said in a statement released by the White House.
Mr. Bush said the Senate should quickly pass a bill consisting mostly of tax cuts for businesses and well-off Americans, which Republicans say will increase investment and lift the economy.
Democrats want to increase benefits for jobless workers more than Republicans do, saying those people need help and they would quickly spend any money they received.
''People who have lost their jobs are starting to lose hope,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader.
Since January, the Fed has reduced its crucial short-term interest rate, which affects a wide variety of credit card, small-business and home equity loans, a total of 10 times, lowering it from 6.5 percent to 2 percent.
Although the cuts have helped prop up consumer spending, they have yet to revive the economy, as businesses continue to reduce their investment after having optimistically binged on new computers, machinery and factory equipment in the late 1990's.
Compared with the official 5.7 percent rate, a broader measure of joblessness, which includes people who are not actively looking for work, rose to 6.2 percent last month, up from 4.5 percent a year ago, the Labor Department said.
More than 1.1 million people reported being unemployed for at least 27 weeks in November, up from 890,000 in October.
Forecasters have long emphasized that job cuts are more a reflection of where an economy has been than of where it is going.
And yesterday -- when a separate survey by the University of Michigan showed a small rise in consumer confidence last month, adding to a spate of surprisingly good economic news in the last week -- bond yields moved up sharply, suggesting that many investors believe that a recovery will arrive early next year.

Reflecting the current level of uncertainty, stock prices fell yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 10,049.46, down 49.68 points.

Even if a recovery is near, however, job losses are likely to continue rising in the coming months, economists said.
Companies typically wait to begin adding to their payrolls until they are confident that their revenues will begin growing again.
Indeed, analysts expect the unemployment rate to continue to move higher and remain around 6 percent for much of next year.
''But I don't think we should necessarily expect to see an immediate increase in employment.
It takes time for the economy to gear up.''
For now, the economy is a long way from gearing up.
Over all, the economy lost 331,000 jobs in November, according to the seasonally adjusted data released by the Labor Department, which also pushed up its estimate of job losses in October to 468,000, making that the worst month since 1974.
Manufacturers have suffered the most in the current recession, largely because companies have drastically cut their capital spending.
Since the summer of 2000, manufacturers have eliminated 1.4 million jobs, or more than one of 20 in the sector.
Manufacturing lost 163,000 jobs in November, the most of any month during its 16-month decline.
''The recession isn't over,'' said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist for Prudential Securities.
''The hopes of the last few weeks have had a splash of cold water thrown on them.''
Still, Mr. Rippe, like most Wall Street forecasters, said he expected that low interest rates and falling energy prices, together with a stimulus bill that he continues to expect from Washington, will get the economy growing again early next year.

In recent months, and especially since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the economic pain has spread well beyond heavy industry.
Airlines and department stores both cut jobs last month.
Temporary-employment agencies continued their huge cutbacks, reducing employment by 87,000, to 2.9 million -- 17 percent below its level early last year.
The broad nature of the recession has also caused joblessness to rise among even highly educated, well-paid workers.
Last month, the jobless rate rose across the educational spectrum, although the 8.1 percent rate for people without high school diplomas remains well above the 3.1 percent rate for college graduates.
Among the few expanding industries, hospital, doctors' offices and health care companies added 32,000 jobs.
Despite the recession, the unemployment rate remains lower than it was for much of the 1980's and early 90's.
This relative tightness of the labor market allowed hourly wages for nonsupervisory workers to continue rising last month at an annual rate of more than 3 percent.
The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 further discouraged merchants, causing many department stores and large specialty retailers to cancel or return orders and toss out plans for reorders.

Now, some hit products are selling out.
Though the examples cited may be isolated ones, it is rare for merchandise other than toys and extremely high-end fashion goods to be unavailable at this point in the season, particularly from mail-order companies.
It suggests more, and more widespread, shortages over the next two weeks, and it presents a new obstacle for retailers in a year in which shoppers are already finicky.
Sales are weak, with consumer spending shifting away from flashy big-ticket merchandise like designer handbags and jewelry in favor of simpler, homier fare like Ping-Pong tables and fuzzy slippers.
Still, with corporate America cinching its purse strings, even with extremely low interest rates, the consumer's role in getting the economy back on its feet is bigger than ever.
A true merchant hates to lose a potential sale, which is what often happens when inventories are lean and most merchandise is ordered from factories in Asia and other far-flung points.
The idea of losing a sale because of not having ordered enough, in a season when any sale is hard to come by, is almost unbearable.
''You are at the beginning of what will be a frantic season, for retailers and for consumers,'' said Walter F. Loeb, head of Loeb Associates, a retail consulting firm.
''Retailers are just not prepared for any unusual spike in demand.
They've cut back on merchandise, they've cut back on people, they've cut back even on light bulbs.''
INVENTORIES, of course, are always a vital issue; every year, retailers must walk a fine line.
Wall Street applauds the companies that keep inventory tight -- on the theory that markdowns, which eat away at profits, will not be necessary.
But this year, many are cutting it close.
Most retailers would rather err on the side of falling short of a few popular products than having piles and piles of unsold goods to mark down.
''You're always going to have an item here or there that you can't replenish,'' he said.
''But we've all learned better merchandise planning and better replenishment.''
Manufacturers, though, say they are also keeping inventories lean this year.

Mr. Cove skirted the issue of whether products ordered today would be available for Christmas, although he did say that merchandise priced promotionally, like basic TV's and DVD players, might run short.
''Things are going to be tight at Christmastime,'' he said.
''There are going to be some spot shortages.''
No one is expecting consumers to storm the malls.
Retailers, especially the department and specialty stores that trade in more fashion-sensitive merchandise, may end up with too much of some products because business is so weak.
But they may also run short of goods that customers crave, which could alienate shoppers and leave stores with little to sell later.
''If the fears about running short come true, they will really get killed in January, which has been a very big month in the last few years,'' said Walter K. Levy, managing director for retail trends and positioning at Kurt Salmon Associates.
LANDS' END is one retailer that increased inventories for the holidays, buying more of its classic turtlenecks, dress shirts, coats and other popular items than last year -- although apparently not enough of popular new ones like the moccasins and reversible jackets.
''We've made a commitment to these items, and we're willing to take the risk that they don't sell in order to make sure we have what our customers are looking for,'' said Emily Leuthner, a Lands' End spokeswoman.
But Lands' End is in a small minority.
''I've increased my own inventories on the theory that other people are maintaining too little inventory and will disappoint their customers,'' he said.
''The big stores have cut back on inventory drastically.''
Depleted inventories not only reduce sales potential but also discourage traffic, which is one reason retailers are so reluctant to discuss the issue on the record.
Retailers, it seems, are damned if they do and damned if they don't.
Too much inventory means big discounts and investor accusations that they are failing to protect profit margins; too little means potential sales lost.

Generally, Wall Street prefers inventories that tend toward the lean side.
Richard N. Baum, senior retail analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, is actually pleased that retailers have ordered less this year.
''I think inventory is less of an issue than last year,'' he said.

Last year, retailers blinded by the fast-growth economy entered the holiday season with shelves and warehouses bursting at the seams, only to see sales evaporate after the first week.
Excluding Gap Inc., which had such a disastrous Christmas in 2000 that it skews comparisons, the net income of some 20 specialty apparel and jewelry companies fell 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year from the previous year, after being higher in every other quarter, according to Credit Suisse First Boston.
This year, Mr. Baum predicts that the same group's profits will decline by only 2 percent because most retailers, forewarned by economic stagnation in general and then by a sharp drop in sales after Sept. 11, kept their orders on the low side.
''They've definitely averted disaster pretty much across the board,'' he said.
Discounters are more insulated than the rest of the retail industry because their merchandise is largely basic, so that the khakis and coats that do not sell before Christmas have a good chance of selling later.
Sales at the three big discount chains, Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, were up 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and are expected to rise an additional 6.4 percent in the period this year, according to Credit Suisse First Boston.
Analysts predict that department stores, with their more seasonal, trend-sensitive merchandise, are most likely to be whipsawed this holiday season.
Last year, sales at seven big department store companies, including Dillard, May and Federated, fell 14.9 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, but Credit Suisse estimates that sales for the group will be down only 5.1 percent this year.
In addition, even with inventories tight, markdowns appear plentiful already, although merchants and analysts say the discounts are largely the normal enticements that stores make at this time of year to move fall merchandise.
Some are skeptical about that.
''Maybe retailers were planning these promotions all along, but they're extending the promotion period so things are on sale sooner and longer and the discounts are deeper,'' said Doug Bade, leader of the supply chain strategy and operations practice at Deloitte Consulting.
Federated, which operates Macy's and Lazarus, among other chains, ordered 3 percent less merchandise for this holiday quarter than for the same period last year.
But the company is expecting sales to fall even more sharply, by 7 to 10 percent.
Reorders of particularly strong merchandise are being considered case by case, said Carol Sanger, Federated's spokeswoman.
''The early bird will get the pick.''
Gap, which has been struggling for the last year, was also cautious.
For the current quarter, Gap expects that value to be down 10 to 12 percent from last year, when it was $59.

Gap, which is both a manufacturer and a retailer, also set aside a $52 million reserve for orders it canceled to reflect its business conditions.
''Where business has been more challenging, for example, on the West Coast, we have been working out inventory issues month by month on a case-by-case basis,'' he said in a written response to questions.
''Other retail businesses have outperformed their original expectations, resulting in requests for more product, and we have successfully chased fill-in product in many instances.''
But other manufacturers do not have the inventory to replenish retailers' stocks.
The toy industry is always the most extreme indicator of holiday sales patterns, and lean inventories are quite obvious there.
''But it has had a large impact, not because people aren't shopping but because retailers were so, so cautious.''
Getting the toys from Asia now, even by air, is next to impossible.
''I've had vice presidents at several retailers screaming at me on the phone for inventory,'' Mr. Rabie said, echoing the comments of other toy makers.
''Any product I've got coming in at all is being used to fill in all the rain checks retailers issued before the season began, not going on to store shelves.''
Spin Masters has cut back on its publicity efforts for the toy and is now talking up its radio-controlled airplane, the Intruder, which is also selling well.

''But let me tell you,'' said Harold Chizick, Spin Master's publicity chief, ''we have three other items we could fill a landfill with.''
''Many of them are just taking a picture and showing it on the camera,'' said Joseph Welch, a director of marketing at Fuji's Photo Film USA commercial imaging division.
''It's the wow factor, the desire to impress with the technology, not the print.''

Part of the problem is cost.
The inks are expensive, and high-quality coated paper sells for about $1 a sheet.
But the biggest barrier remains the ''chain of pain'' -- the many complicated steps involved in printing photographs at home.
''Uploading photos to online services or printing them at home is still a pain in the neck,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
As digital cameras become commonplace, printing lags further behind.
As a group, those who make prints make an average of 34 pictures a month.
But that number is skewed by a few hobbyists who print hundreds of shots; the median number of prints is just 10 a month.
Analysts figure it would take twice that for, say, Eastman Kodak to make up for lost film revenue.
''Mothers with kids traditionally make the most prints, but the early adopters of digital camera technology are primarily young and male,'' said Gibboney Huske, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
The disappointment has not been as intense for printer companies, which never derived any profits from conventional film anyway.
In fact, some say they are perfectly happy with what they see as steady, albeit slow, growth in home photo printing.
Ned Bunnell, a director of product management for Canon USA, said 48 percent of people who own Canon inkjet printers are printing some photographs at home.

One reason, said Lisa Dowling, Hewlett's North America photo printer product manager, is that photo printers cost around $400 a year ago but are now less than $200.

Still, it is easy to cite huge increases when the starting point is low.
Lexmark's Mr. Craig notes that only 2 million of the 68 million inkjet printers sold worldwide last year were specifically for photos.
''The truth is, it's still easier to drop off a single-use camera and pick up prints a few hours later,'' he said.
Printer and film companies are scrambling.
In April, Canon began bundling with its printers a piece of software, PhotoRecord, that reduces the steps in print-making.
Canon is also holding demonstrations at retailers like Staples to demystify the printing process further.
Kodak recently introduced Easy Share, a combination camera, dock and software package that makes it easier to upload pictures to a PC.
Kodak also bundles the software with some cameras and with its inkjet paper and has posted free versions on its Web page.
''One of our goals is to reduce the steps in making prints and to make those that remain as simple as possible,'' said Philip Gerskovich, chief operating officer for Kodak's digital and applied imaging division.
Several companies have devised ways to cut computers out of the printing equation.
Some involve plugging the camera's memory card into a printer slot; others eliminate even that step and let the consumer dock the camera in a printer bay.
But so far, sales of those printers have disappointed.
''People want to e-mail photos, so they have to transfer images to the PC anyway,'' Mr. Gerskovich said.
Kodak and Fuji are hedging their bets: they are selling digital development equipment -- and, of course, paper -- to retailers, on the theory that consumers fed up with the travails of home printing will simply drop their memory cards off.

The Photo Marketing Association says that only 3 percent of consumers use retailers to process prints, but the film companies are trying hard to change that.
Fuji, for one, is dedicating a lot of its marketing budget to Frontier, a minilab that retailers can use to make prints from digital cameras.
Kodak, too, offers a digital development lab to retailers.
It is also installing digital printing capability at many of the self-service printmaking kiosks it has at retail outlets and is testing digital-only kiosks at camera stores.
If they prove popular, Kodak hopes to put them in hotel lobbies, rental car offices and other places frequented by picture-happy travelers.
No one has given up on the concept of printing photos at home, of course.
But so far, most executives are still perplexed over how to make it easy enough.
''There's still a robust opportunity for printing pictures at home, but no one's cracked the code yet,'' said Mr. Craig of Lexmark.
Eventually, analysts say, someone will.
''People do prefer to print at home,'' said Mr. Rosenzweig of Salomon Smith Barney.
''The opportunity's there in the long haul; it is just a question of when.''
Low-income homeowners can be easy targets for unscrupulous lenders.
They are frequently forced to refinance their mortgages in the so-called subprime market, where interest rates are higher.
Too often, such loans are also loaded with conditions -- including excessive fees and balloon payments -- that are potentially ruinous to the borrower.
The victims, disproportionately, are the elderly, African-Americans and immigrants.
Subprime lenders minimize their risk and maximize their returns by selling loans in bundles to large financial companies -- known as the secondary market -- which in turn sell them as investments.
According to a study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, securities backed by subprime mortgages increased from $11 billion in 1994 to $83 billion in 1998.
It's big business.
Unscrupulous lenders often work with mortgage brokers and home-improvement contractors to lure customers.
In a typical scheme, a contractor approaches the homeowner, suggesting expensive repairs and offering the name of a broker who can arrange an equity loan.
In New York City, where the problem is especially acute, the City Council is expected to vote today on a bill that would prohibit the city from doing business with any financial institution that engages, directly or indirectly, in predatory lending.
The measure does not aim to kill the subprime financing business -- which, when legitimate, is an essential tool for community development.
But it would extract the bad apples.
It would require companies in the secondary market to review a sampling of loans given at an interest rate of six or more points above the prime, focusing on ZIP codes where predatory lenders do business.
Where abusive lending has occurred, financial companies will have an opportunity to fix their practices before they are cut off from doing city business.
The City Council bill would require more work from banks, which are lobbying against the proposal, even threatening to pull out of the subprime market, and they're getting a sympathetic hearing in City Hall.
But clearly any system that allows the poor and unsuspecting to be bilked needs fixing.
The City Council has offered a creative and laudable solution.
The banks, as good corporate citizens, should work with the legislators to make it work.
Korean households are in debt for $325 billion, 8 percent more than at the end of the first quarter, the Bank of Korea said.

The Dow is down 3.6 percent for the week, and if it closes at the same level on Monday, it would be off 11.1 percent for the month and 16.7 percent for the quarter.
That would be the worst September since 1937 and the worst quarter since the 1987 market crash.
That is a decline of 2.1 percent for the week, 9.7 percent for the month so far and 16.4 percent for the quarter, also its worst quarterly performance since 1987.
For the week the Nasdaq was down 1.8 percent and would be off 8.8 percent for the month and 18 percent for the quarter.

Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said in a report yesterday that ''repeated shocks to the U.S. economy are delaying the onset of a full-fledged recovery.''
Also weighing on investors is the continued debate over a possible war in Iraq, which drove the price of crude oil over $30 a barrel this week.
''I had been thinking that the war is not really having that much impact,'' Mr. Paulsen of Wells Capital said.
''But maybe that thing hanging out there is enough to keep the bearishness alive.''
A further rise in the price of oil, economists agree, would put additional drag on the economic recovery, which is already producing very little job growth.
Without job growth, it will be harder for consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic growth, to keep the economy expanding.

Delta, the nation's third-largest airline, also announced that it would eliminate 1,500 flight attendant jobs, or about 9 percent of those jobs.
In the bond market, interest rates slipped lower, as they usually have done when stocks are falling.
It is just above the 3.65 percent it hit Tuesday, the lowest yield on a government security with a 10-year maturity in more than 40 years, according to the Federal Reserve.
The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 31/32 , to 105 28/32 .
The decline in longer-term rates has finally pushed 30-year mortgage rates, already at 40-year lows, below 6 percent.
That should keep the rush to refinance mortgages and to buy new homes going.
But analysts have said that this activity, though welcome, will not be enough to produce a robust recovery.
Some of the stories in ''Things You Should Know'' -- an archly didactic title considering the things in it that you've no real need to know -- display the grotesque very much for its own sake.
The extremity is disproportionate to any human message; the transgressiveness a sort of artistic complacency.
''Rockets Round the Moon'' is an example.
Here, as in some of her other fiction, Homes writes not only of the sterility but of the dark nightmare corners of suburban life.
The narrator, a boy whose divorced parents are chilly and dietarily correct (large salad meals), spends his time in a neighboring household, marked by warmth, noise and baloney sandwiches.
It is a refuge until the father, speeding, runs over a child.
That life offers no safety, even, or especially, in the suburbs, would be a reasonable point.
Homes gothicizes it by having the repentant father try to incinerate himself in his barbecue pit; and his son, the narrator's pal, attempts an equivalent suicide by standing up suddenly during an amusement park ride.
He manages only to throw up, befouling the narrator, while the author as arbitrary deity seems, as it were, to hold herself coolly apart.

In ''Georgica,'' a young woman haunts the beach at night to spy on young men with their girlfriends, and, fed up with men and wanting a child ''born of the sea,'' recovers their used condoms to inseminate herself.

By far the finest balance between oddness and the heart is in ''The Chinese Lesson.''
The story opens with Geordie Harris, the narrator, walking the streets of his suburb holding a global positioning device.
He is looking for his Chinese mother-in-law, who tends to wander off, and has had an electronic chip implanted to help him find her.
Satire, of course, but telling.
Our virtual means turn real ends into virtual ones: old Mrs. Ha has been to this degree de-natured.

The satire segues into a story of marriage and distances.
Geordie cossets his mother-in-law, helps her shop for chicken feet for soup.
His wife, Chinese-American, can't stand her mother and the old ways she represents; the chicken feet, she is sure, are a poisonous conspiracy.
He tries to reason with her chilly hostility; after all Kate, their daughter, is half-Chinese.
''I don't like that half of Kate,'' she replies.
The story is surreal, it is emblematic and it has a beating heart.
At the end there is a moment of cinematic beauty.
Geordie thinks quixotically of taking their whole family to China, imagining they will all reconnect there.
He recalls the story of a man who has a bicycle accident in the Chinese countryside and breaks his hip.
There is no help; he fashions his broken bicycle into a crutch and makes his way to the city.

Here Homes approaches the art of the great absurdists.
Strangeness becomes a revealing back entrance into the human condition of our day.
''The quality of the insurers' capital and their heavy dependence on the banks has become a serious concern,'' said Runa Ichihari, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's in Tokyo.

That most life insurers are not listed also means the dangers they face from a declining stock market receive less investor scrutiny compared with the banks.
Yet with the stock market at current levels, almost every key life insurer will have to record paper losses on their portfolios when the fiscal year closes on Monday, Ms. Ichihari said.
Sagging stock prices have also exposed the widening gap between strong and weak life insurers.
The healthier companies like Nippon Life Insurance and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance have more profitable stock and bond portfolios and belong to sturdier banking groups.
The weaker players including Mitsui Mutual Life Insurance and Asahi Mutual Life Insurance were among the five life insurers Standard & Poor's downgraded this month.

All life insurers, though, face the same difficulty paying the returns they guaranteed to policyholders.
The faltering stock market and record low interest rates have created ''negative spreads'' between these rates and the actual returns the insurers can produce.
In a sign of desperation, the insurers have lobbied the government during the last year to let them break these contracts and unilaterally lower the guaranteed rates.
Regulators have refused arguing that such a change will erode investor confidence and encourage cancellations.
Lawmakers will resume debate on the issue when the Parliament reconvenes in October.
Regardless of what lawmakers do, the insurers still face a bleak economy.
The value of new policies issued has fallen in seven out of the last eight years, as the birthrate slows and Japanese households tighten their purse strings.
The rate of policy cancellations has grown four straight years.

But analysts say the effects of these moves will not really be felt for years, and so they will not offset the more immediate blow from the stock market's decline or the other problems that plague the life insurers.
Still, financial regulators, stretched thin from trying to cope with the bank debacle, insist that the insurers are on firm footing.
Yet the government is unprepared to deal with angry policyholders if a large insurer fails.
The Life Insurance Policyholders' Protection Corporation of Japan has nearly exhausted its financing after compensating policyholders after several insurers folded in the last three years.
The government is considering replenishing its share of the safety net when it comes up for renewal in April.
But lawmakers also want the insurers to contribute more to their fund.
The industry, however, has rebuffed those requests.
The weakest insurers, analysts say, do not have enough capital on hand.
But it's starting to look as if the interest rate cuts weren't enough.
I don't need to tell you about the stock market.
Economic indicators strongly suggest that the economy is either sliding into a double-dip, ''W-shaped'' recession -- bet you thought I was talking about the guy in the White House -- or close enough as makes no difference.

It's easy to make fun of the country's enormous spending on public works -- all those bridges to nowhere in particular, highways with no traffic, and so on.
Without question enormous sums have been wasted.
But it's also clear that all that spending pumped money into the economy, preventing what might otherwise have been a full-fledged depression.

So what will be the U.S. equivalent?
Right now we are in effect following the reverse policy: slashing domestic spending in the face of an economic slump.
Some of this is taking place at the federal level; the Bush administration is nickel-and-diming public spending wherever it can, shaving a billion here, a billion there off everything from veterans' benefits and homeland security to Medicare payments.
More important, the federal government is doing nothing to help as state and local governments, their revenues savaged by recession, make deep cuts in spending on everything that isn't urgently necessary, and many things that are.
It's true that we haven't yet confronted head on the possibility that Uncle Alan may not be able to save us single-handedly.
But last fall's debate over economic stimulus suggested that our political leadership cannot make a rational response to economic problems.
Remember the proposal to give retroactive tax breaks to ChevronTexaco and Enron?
In the end, the need for stimulus was less urgent than it seemed at the time, but there is no reason to think that we'll do better if, as now seems all too likely, the recovery stumbles.
Of course, the worst thing of all would be if our leadership decides that economics is not its thing, if it simply tries to distract the public from rising unemployment and plunging stocks by going off and invading someone.
But we don't have to worry about that, do we?

The yield on the Treasury's two-year note, which is sensitive to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, climbed to 1.79 percent from 1.69 percent.
But even at 1.79 percent, the low level of the two-year note indicates that many investors are betting that Fed policy makers will cut the benchmark interest rate to 1.50 percent, from 1.75 percent, when they next meet in November.

If yields do not move much lower, there is little price appreciation, or capital gain, in the offing.
That leaves historically low yields as the generator of an investor's returns.

It is this prospect of low returns that is making stocks look appetizing again.
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, argues that it is not hard for stocks to beat Treasury securities from here and once many investors figure that out, the selling to get out of bonds should push Treasury yields higher, and prices lower.
He makes this comparison of the Treasury's 10-year note and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The current yield on the 10-year note is 3.68 percent.
If interest rates remain unchanged during the next year, the total return would be the same.
The dividend yield on the stocks in the S.& P. 500 is 1.92 percent.
This means that the index needs to increase only 1.76 percent over the next year to match the return from Treasuries.
Every point above 1.76 percent is gravy.
The composite yield on the Merrill Lynch index of Treasury notes and bonds at the end of the third quarter was 3.04 percent, which means the S.& P. index would have to climb 1.12 percent to match the index.
The dividend yield on the Dow Jones industrial average is 2.45 percent, meaning it would have to climb 1.23 percent over the next year to match the return on the 10-year note and 0.59 percent to equal the return on the Merrill Lynch note and bond index.

Another argument for getting out of Treasuries is that any rally in the stock market is likely to send bond and note yields higher and prices lower, creating capital losses that will eat into the already meager total return.
The opposite should be true with a stock rally.

If the economy were to slow further; fall into a second, double-dip recession or appear headed toward a long period of stagnation, Treasury securities would still look good.

''We are at a fork in the road, staring at two possible futures,'' said Jay Mueller, an economist and money market portfolio manager at Strong Capital Management.
One road is the stagnation experienced in Japan and the other is slow, but steady, economic recovery.
Mr. Mueller is betting on a steady recovery.
''The Federal Reserve will be willing to do what is necessary,'' he said, adding that if the Japan situation is avoided ''it is hard to see interest rates going lower from here'' because investors in the Treasury market have already assumed the worst.
''There is some disaster built into Treasuries now,'' he said.
''There is the war premium; there is fear of deflation and there are investors fleeing from the stock market.''
''So,'' he added, ''if we get a period of modest economic growth, avoid a double-dip recession and Japanese-style stagnation that will be an unpleasant surprise for bonds and a pleasant surprise for equities.''

But what may worry investors more is that the company's chief executive said that business confidence was being battered, a fact that makes the outlook for the economy and corporate earnings for the rest of this year and early next year less positive.

Another earnings disappointment came from Boeing, which said that it would reduce its third-quarter earnings by $158 million to offset the declining value of the aircraft it leases to airlines.
Wall Street analysts had been expecting Boeing to earn 66 cents a share in the quarter, according to a survey by the research firm Thomson First Call.
While earnings expectations are declining and are likely to continue to be a drag on stocks, the job outlook may be even more crucial for investors because it has been consumer spending -- not capital investment by businesses -- that has been keeping the economic recovery going.

''From our standpoint, labor market conditions continue to be key to the near-term course of the economy,'' Mr. Greenlaw of Morgan Stanley said.

For all of the itching realism of ''Boogie Nights,'' the panoramic history of the Valley's vast pornography industry that put Mr. Anderson on the map in 1997, the film retained a buoyant, lyrical side, conveyed through graceful long takes and gliding Steadicam shots.

His 1999 film, ''Magnolia,'' a sweeping vision of a dozen lives linked by chance and compassion, took its title from one of the Valley's principal thoroughfares, Magnolia Boulevard, along which much of the movie is set.
Mr. Anderson places some of the most penetrating, naturalistic dialogue this side of David Mamet in the context of what might be described as a Cubist narrative, offering a multitude of perspectives through characters whose situations eerily reflect one another's.
Now there is ''Punch-Drunk Love,'' a romantic comedy opening Friday about a businessman, Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), who wholesales novelty toilet plungers out of a Valley warehouse.
Barry's life looks more than routine: he's become obsessed with clipping coupons for frequent flier miles from pudding containers.
But one morning his world is transformed by three inexplicable events: A car overturns, causing a sickening accident on the street in front of Barry's building.
A taxi pulls up to the curb, and a slightly battered harmonium is gently unloaded on the sidewalk.
And a lovely, sweet-tempered Englishwoman, Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), appears out of nowhere and falls in love with him.
With its small cast, limited locations and a running time of only 89 minutes (as opposed to the 188 minutes of ''Magnolia''), ''Punch-Drunk Love'' is clearly a reaction against the sweep and scale of Mr. Anderson's last two films.
The new picture feels like a rest stop, a time to recharge the batteries, but is no less dazzling and original for it.

''I just remember thinking that I would like to do something simple, to try to do a romance movie and to work with Adam and to work with Emily,'' Mr. Anderson said of the film's origins.
''I think you usually just start off where you left off.
Your first instinct is you just want to go the other way.''

One inspiration was Jacques Tati, the French comic and filmmaker whose acutely observed comedies include ''Mr.
Hulot's Holiday'' (1953) and ''Playtime'' (1967).

Not everyone, of course, would cast the aggressively outgoing Mr. Sandler as a modern-day version of Tati's Hulot, a shy and gentle eccentric with a tendency to disappear within his own movies.
''At the end of the day, it's really just how funny he is to me,'' Mr. Anderson said of Mr. Sandler.
''Everything he does is very funny and very human.
And I like what a mystery he is, really, how we don't know much about his personal life, which was really nice.
And I just love it when he gets angry.''
Always a significant element of his screen personality, Mr. Sandler's temper plays an especially large part in ''Punch-Drunk Love.''
In his own movies, he has often portrayed the put-upon loser who finally gets fed up and explodes, exacting a hideous vengeance on his tormentors.
Mr. Sandler's outbursts have a frighteningly realistic edge in ''Punch-Drunk Love'' that lifts them out of their usual farcical context.
In the film, his eruptions of rage, which include the trashing of a restaurant washroom and a confrontation with a phone-sex pimp (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, so far the only actor to appear in all of Mr. Anderson's films), take on an Old Testament fury.
They are both mad and majestic, a crippling limitation and a strange, powerful gift.

As Lena, Ms. Watson plays one of the many guardian angel figures who populate Mr. Anderson's films: those caregivers who seem to appear out of nowhere and offer protection and redemption.
One is the veteran gambler (Philip Baker Hall) who adopts the down-and-out character played by John C. Reilly in ''Hard Eight'' (1996).
Another is Burt Reynolds as the paternalistic pornographer who takes the stunningly endowed actor played by Mark Wahlberg under his wing in ''Boogie Nights.''
And there is Mr. Reilly again, as a selfless Los Angeles patrolman who comes to the rescue of a deeply troubled young woman (Melora Walters) in ''Magnolia.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Analyzing his work makes Mr. Anderson uncomfortable.
All he will say about these recurring figures is: ''Well, it's always nice to have someone smack you on the head and tell you to shape up a little bit.
You count on that.''
Of Mr. Reilly's character in ''Magnolia,'' all he will say is, ''That's really what Reilly is like, more than anything.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In the director's commentary recorded for the DVD release of ''Hard Eight'' (a film Mr. Anderson prefers to call by its original title, ''Sydney''), he links Sydney, Mr. Hall's wise older man, to his own father, Ernie Anderson, a professional voice-over artist and onetime host of a Friday night horror movie showcase in Cleveland.
(Mr. Anderson's production company, Ghoulardi, is named after his father's character.)
If Mr. Anderson's work abounds with positive parent-child relationships, both literal and metaphorical, there are also many poisonous ones.
In the elaborate game of mirrors that is ''Magnolia,'' Mr. Hall returns as a father, a celebrated game show host, who has destroyed his daughter's life; and Jason Robards (in what was to be his final film role) is a dying television producer who is unexpectedly reunited with the son he had abandoned as a child (Tom Cruise as a woman-hating self-help guru).
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The parent-child relationship -- as played out as well by Mr. Sandler and Ms. Watson in ''Punch-Drunk'' -- is a paradigm of responsibility, perhaps the most important moral quality in Mr. Anderson's work.
Given the absurdity of a universe ruled by chance, in which harmoniums suddenly appear on sidewalks and frogs rain from the sky (as happens at a key moment in ''Magnolia'') responsibility may be a tenuous concept, but it is what holds Mr. Anderson's couples and communities together.
His work occupies a tumultuous space somewhere between chaos and control, between an abandonment to chance and a determination to put things right.
''Hard Eight'' is the only one of Mr. Anderson's films to have a conventional, three-act narrative structure, following the evolution of the father-son relationship between a raw young gambler (Mr. Reilly) and a shrewd veteran (Mr. Hall).
(Set in Nevada, it's also his only film not rooted in the San Fernando Valley.)
Since then, he has experimented with a variety of forms.
''Boogie Nights'' is constructed like a Zola novel, built around group scenes that offer panoramic portraits of specific social and professional classes.
The effect is enhanced by the use of long, uninterrupted Steadicam takes that suggest the interconnectedness of the characters.

''Magnolia'' is a magic carpet ride through the Valley, gracefully gliding among a number of different stories, all involving lonely, isolated people and building to a mystical climax that unites the characters in a shared, preposterous experience.
''Punch-Drunk Love'' is Mr. Anderson's most radical experiment to date.
Its staccato rhythms and jagged editing seem a direct reaction to the softness and smoothness of ''Magnolia.''
This is a film of lulling interludes punctuated by sudden loud noises, explosions of anger or acts of physical destruction.
(Huge trucks keep appearing out of nowhere.)
Between the film's agitated first and last movements, there is a lovely entr'acte in which the action is suddenly propelled to Hawaii, and the jangling soundtrack is replaced by the impossibly sweet sound of Shelley Duvall singing Harry Nilsson's wistful ballad ''He Needs Me,'' from the movie ''Popeye.''

With his precise control of rhythm and tone -- he speaks often of the momentum of his films -- Mr. Anderson has a very musical sense of the cinema.
He has had no musical training, he said (although his companion is the singer Fiona Apple), but he does call in his regular composer, Jon Brion, during the planning stages.
''You try to attack it early on, just so you know a little bit of what might be happening when you shoot,'' Mr. Anderson said.
''When you're in a jam on the set and trying to remember what is going on, just keep your mind on the music that will be there.
It always helps guide you back toward shore.''
There's another, subtler musical element in ''Punch-Drunk Love.''
Throughout the film, Mr. Sandler's Barry Egan wears a suit made of the most amazing deep blue material.
''And if you watch 'Singin' in the Rain,' too, it's sort of indicative of these movies that there's a fantastic rich blue suit in just about every one of them.
Look next time and you ll see them.

''So it's a little bit like a musical thing,'' Mr. Anderson said.

As Congress prepares to resume debate on a resolution supporting the use of force in Iraq, Americans said they thought members of both parties were trying to manipulate the issue for their political advantage.
''Bush is spending way too much time focusing on Iraq instead of the economy, and he's doing it as a political move,'' said Gladys Steele, 42, a homemaker from Seattle who is a political independent, in a follow-up interview yesterday.
''He thinks keeping us fearful about going to war will distract us from how bad the economy is.''
The poll was conducted a month before what Democrats and Republicans view as an extraordinarily competitive round of midterm Congressional elections.

In recent days many Democrats have grown glum about the upcoming election, arguing that Mr. Bush and the White House have successfully drowned out domestic issues that the Democrats had hoped to capitalize on with his talk of war.
Many Democrats had even feared that the debate over war had undermined their chances of winning the House and holding on to their one-seat margin in the Senate.

Mr. Bush is to deliver a national address on the subject tonight.
But the Times/CBS News poll suggests that no matter what is happening in Washington, voters are more concerned with the economy and domestic issues than with what is happening with Saddam Hussein, presenting the Democrats a glimmer of hope as Congress prepares to vote on the Iraq resolution and adjourn to campaign.

Whether any of this makes a difference in an election that will most likely be decided in a handful of Senate and House races is an entirely different matter.
A nationwide poll, while revealing of broad sentiments in the American electorate, cannot be used to predict results accurately in the relatively small number of Congressional races that are considered competitive.
It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
By every indication, the subject of Iraq should dominate the news out of Washington for at least the next week.
There is Mr. Bush's speech tonight, and then the debate in Congress is expected to last at least through Friday.

Two-thirds of Americans say they approve of the United States using military power to oust Mr. Hussein.
A majority of Americans say that Mr. Bush has a clear plan to deal with Iraq; by contrast, a majority say the White House does not have a clear plan to deal with terrorism at home.
But there are signs of ambivalence.

Similarly, most Americans said Mr. Bush should not act until he wins approval from Congress -- and they applauded Congress's pushing the administration for details on its Iraqi plans.
More than half said that Mr. Bush was more interested in removing Mr. Hussein than in removing potentially lethal weapons.

Democrats have hoped that concern about the economy would allow them to turn this election into a referendum on Republican fiscal policies, in a way that would sweep out of office a large number of Republicans -- what politicians refer to as a nationalization of the election.

There were other findings that could prove important over the final weeks of the campaign.
Over the summer, Democrats had hoped that the turmoil on Wall Street and reports of corporate malfeasance would give them an issue to use against Republicans.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Thursday through Saturday with 668 adults throughout the United States.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.
Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.
The cheerful statistics, and expectations of a big budget surplus to go with them, amount to a windfall for the governing Liberal Party at a time when infighting and cabinet scandals have forced Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to drop thoughts of running for a fourth term.
He is due to step down as party leader in early 2004, but his general economic policy line has support from several of his potential Liberal successors.

With 400,000 new jobs created over the last year, and unemployment declining, the Liberals expect to remain strong with their working-class voter base.
They also expect to reverse the cutbacks of the 1990's and expand services.
Just last week Mr. Chrétien announced that next year's budget would include new spending on urban low-income housing, health care and transportation, national parks, education and programs to aid the impoverished Indian population.
The spending should ease the way for the next Liberal leader to defeat a badly divided opposition.
Canada's good economic fortunes may also prove helpful to the slowing United States economy, given that Canada buys 25 percent of all American exports.
Finance Minister John Manley, one of the potential candidates to succeed Mr. Chrétien, recently described Canada as ''the new Northern Tiger.''
He noted that his country was ''advancing against the tide of a global downturn and overcoming years of weak fiscal management to become the fastest-growing economy in the G-7 and likely the only one to remain in surplus this year.''

Mr. Manley's boosterism was intended in part to renew investors' appetite for the Canadian dollar and stock market, both of which have been slipping in recent months in large part because of investors' worries about trends in the United States.

Economists note that when Canada did not follow the United States into a recession after the Sept. 11 attacks, it was the first time in 25 years that the country had been able to avert being tugged into an American tailspin.
Low interest rates, the construction boom, surges in car and truck production and higher prices for the oil and gas that Canada produces have enabled the country to go on thriving, at least so far.

Canadians, economists note, did not invest as heavily in high-technology companies in the 1990's, so the collapse of that sector has not hit the Canadian economy as hard.
The Canadian economy was helped by American growth in the 1990's, but it remains a step or two behind the American business cycle.
While the American home-building boom is five years old, for example, Canada's is only a little more than a year old, and probably could run for several more years before saturating the demand.
Still, economists warn that Canada would have a hard time remaining aloof from a long American downturn, because 86 percent of Canadian exports go south of the border.

Since many sugar workers have only a ninth-grade education, officials said the government is building new schools to allow them to receive a salary while studying for their high-school diplomas.

Partly because the peso has been relatively stable against the dollar lately, and partly because of a worrying rise in home burglaries, some 4.1 billion pesos ($1.1 billion) in fresh money has actually flowed into the banks since late July, according to the Central Bank.

''The market has been transformed completely,'' Mr. Sanchez said.
''It will be years before the mortgage market comes back or for investment banking to recover, but there is a real demand for transactions -- financial services that use money in checking accounts efficiently.''

Comafi has its eye on the subsidiaries of Crédit Agricole of France, which also closed earlier this year, and Mr. Sanchez predicted that other foreign banks could follow.
Complicating the picture is a flurry of proposed legislation that the industry says would place heavy new burdens on the weakened banks.
One proposal would reinstate a tax meant to replenish a bankrupt union-run health plan for workers; another would make foreign parent banks legally responsible for any new deposits taken by their Argentine subsidiaries.
The Argentine Banking Association is dead set against both plans, according to an internal memorandum.

Another friction point is a judicial investigation set off by a news report that top executives of foreign banks' local subsidiaries had been solicited for bribes in exchange for halting the legislation.
The investigation has turned into something of a soap opera, with raids of bank offices by special police squads, leaks of testimony to news outlets and, last week, incendiary nationalist speeches in the Senate demanding that three leading bankers -- Emilio Cárdenas of HSBC, Carlos Giovanelli of Citibank and Manuel Sacerdote of Bank Boston -- be prosecuted for treason.
After it was pointed out that the treason laws apply only during wartime, the senators switched to accusing the bankers of ''sponsoring economic sanctions against Argentina,'' a violation of a 1951 law.

None of the accused bankers has commented publicly on the matter.
The timing of the uproar could hardly be worse, coming as Argentina hopes to strike a deal with the International Monetary Fund for emergency aid to help it make debt payments.
''Passions are running high, and this corruption issue is a very hot potato,'' said Ben Laidler, regional analyst at UBS Warburg in Santiago, Chile.

Under pressure from its members, the European Commission has already relaxed part of the pact, pushing back the deadline for balanced budgets to 2006 from 2004.

''As a Kuwaiti, I am happy with America's presence here,'' he said, ''but as a Muslim, I don't like it.''
That ambivalence is being fed by the growing fundamentalist movement, which bridles at the American presence here, and by anger over the treatment of Palestinians by Israel, which many Muslims consider an American puppet.
Kuwaiti government officials say the assault was carried out with the help of other militants who were also planning a larger attack.
Several of those people are now in custody; it is not yet clear whether they have direct links to Al Qaeda, the terrorist network of Osama bin Laden.

Mr. Mulaifi and others here believe that the attacks will not stop with this one.
Many Kuwaitis have hailed the two assailants as martyrs.
According to several who attended the men's funeral, the bodies were not washed before burial -- the custom in Islam when the dead are martyrs.

Jaber al-Jalahma, a prominent fundamentalist cleric who spoke at the funeral, told mourners that the attack ''was a message to all of us.''

''They were better than us,'' he said of the assailants, according to witnesses, ''because they stood up against infidels bent on usurping our rights.''
Despite lingering gratitude toward the United States for having driven Iraqi troops from Kuwait, many Kuwaitis now want the American military to leave the region.
Some blame the United States for not having ousted Mr. Hussein in 1991, arguing that he was left in power so Washington could strengthen its military presence here.
Few Kuwaitis support an American invasion now, though the United States would most likely use Kuwait as a base during any war.

''America kept playing this game, insisting that Saddam posed a great threat to Kuwait to justify their long-term presence in the gulf,'' Nasser al-Khonais, a 31-year-old librarian at Kuwait's Ministry of Education, said.

Passions would most likely be inflamed if the Bush administration acted on its proposals to set up an occupation government in Iraq after ousting Mr. Hussein.
Such a move would confirm the theory that America's policy toward Iraq has been an elaborate plot to dominate the region.
Many people here stress that views like this are held by only a small minority of Kuwaitis.
''You do here, as anywhere in the world, have some Islamist elements who think bin Laden is great,'' a Western diplomat said.

But even among more moderate Muslims, there is a growing ambivalence toward America.
Islamist politicians have become a major political force in the country since the end of the Persian Gulf war and now account for a third of the Kuwaiti Parliament.
The Muslim Brotherhood, which has spawned several militant groups, and the Salafi movement, promoting Islamic fundamentalism, are both active here.
The attack this week in a country that is often referred to as America's staunchest ally in the Persian Gulf gives some measure of the depth and breadth of the anti-American feeling growing among young Arabs across the region.

''If pampered, wealthy Kuwaitis raised in pro-American afterglow of the gulf war could do this, imagine what a poor Yemeni warrior will do,'' Mr. Mulaifi said.
He himself is a study in the radical change in attitudes toward the United States since the gulf war.
At home this week, he stood leafing proudly through his private archives of Qaeda material, housed in a small, locked room with an electric sliding door.

To the Editor:
''Falling Shares as a Symptom of Something Bleaker'' (Economic View, Oct. 6) reminded us of the opportunity for consumers despite the self-reinforcing cycle of slow economic growth and falling stock prices.
Einstein had three rules: From clutter, create simplicity.
From discord, create harmony.
From difficulty, find opportunity.
The odd incentive for consumers to continue spending in a bear market is real.
The diminished fears of missing out on a stock market rally free up capital for other purposes.
Although saving is an important feature of sound financial planning, the chance to finance purchases at the lowest interest rates in 40 years should not be missed.
Carpe diem.
ELISABETH DeMARSE
Manhattan, Oct. 6
The writer is the president and chief executive of Bankrate Inc.
If passed by the council on a second reading, scheduled for Oct. 22, the measures would forbid sitting or sleeping in doorways in the downtown business district at night and restrict groups that feed the homeless.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Many homeless people and their advocates say the measures are tantamount to ejecting the homeless from Santa Monica, where the population of 85,000 swells to as many as half a million on summer weekends.
''This is a tourist town -- rich people live here,'' said Viper Meade, 31, holding herself up with a walker because of a spine injury sustained in a car accident six years ago.
''They want to push the homeless out of here.
They blame us for everything.''
While over the years a state trespassing law and several previous ordinances here -- including nighttime park closures, passed in 1995 -- have been used to rein in the homeless, the new, more stringent measures are part of an effort by downtown business owners to stop what they see as a blight that affects commerce.

''We need to take a tough-love stance,'' said Wally Marks, a landlord on the Third Street Promenade, a bustling pedestrian thoroughfare, and former chairman of the Bayside District Corporation, which runs the downtown business area.
''There's always a bad apple.
That's trouble when you're trying to keep the place clean.''

Mr. Marks said that cleaning up after homeless people who use doorways as toilets is not in the job description of the clerks who open businesses in the morning.

''These people take up every bench on the promenade, with all their stuff, and shoppers can't sit down.
It looks bad to see these people sleeping all over when we've got visitors from all over the world.''

The rule against sleeping in storefront doorways would be enforced between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.
The other ordinance would require charities to obtain county health department permits in order to conduct feedings, which would then be regulated by the city as distinct events.
Charities fear that in the competition for space with other organizations planning events in the parks, they would be edged out.
To officials here, no other city in the area is doing enough for Los Angeles County's 84,000 homeless people, leaving the burden to Santa Monica.
''But it's hard for me to accept the argument that because we do more than our share, we should force people out who have nowhere to go,'' said Mayor Michael Feinstein, 43, who voted for the measure regarding sleeping in doorways but against the restrictions on feeding.
He called it ''a way to starve people out of the city.''

With the economy faltering, and charitable contributions down, ''this isn't the moment for a compassionate city to draw the line and say, 'No more,' '' Mr. Feinstein said as he visited the City Hall lawn today on in-line skates.

To some of the homeless waiting to eat here today, that line was drawn long ago.
''I hate this place,'' said a 44-year-old musician who calls himself Melodious Mike, a regular here who lives under a bridge in Culver City, a couple of miles inland.
''I don't like the vibe.
I don't like the cops.''
''All Santa Monica is trying to do is clean up the act,'' Mr. Chauff, the former merchant mariner, said as he waited for the church group to arrive with the food -- canned tuna, crackers, mayonnaise, relish, granola bars, bagels, fruit juice and coffee.
''The city is trying to cut down on excessive panhandling and excessive behavior,'' he said, ''and you can't blame them for that.''

Some food providers said they would try to go along.
''If we can, we'll comply with the letter of the law,'' said Fernando Moreno, director of campus ministry at Loyola Marymount University, which has run a feeding program for five years.
''There's always a way to help the poor -- that's a gospel mandate.
It's really not an option that we have.''

Mr. Schwartsman and other analysts criticized the rate increase, saying it came at a time when concern was growing over the effect of higher rates.
The government has kept rates high in a bid to stabilize markets, part of a policy supported by the International Monetary Fund, which recently offered to lend Brazil $30 billion.
But the higher interest rates combined with the currency's slide have led to ballooning debt costs.
Differing from some of their counterparts in the United States, few investors in Brazil are worried about a default of domestic debt as long as the central bank is able to roll over bonds in the overnight market or redeem debt by printing money, measures that would inevitably fuel inflation.
Still, analysts are worried about the costs of additional rate increases.
Yesterday's increase, Mr. Schwartsman said, could cost the government in interest payments the equivalent of 1.8 percent of gross domestic product, limiting its ability to alleviate social tensions with public spending.

Analysts said yesterday that if the strategy of Arminio Fraga, the president of Brazil's central bank, is to work, rates should not remain high for long.
Seeking to prevent wide swings in the currency, Mr. Fraga has become more assertive in recent days.

Last Friday, for example, the central bank made it more costly to bet against the real by increasing the amount of reais that banks must keep as reserves.

''At least Fraga is sending a clear message that he has tools available with which to fight,'' said Ignacio Sosa, principal manager of OneWorld Investments, a hedge fund based in Boston.
The real, which briefly fell to a low of 4 to the dollar last week, has declined 40 percent this year.
A weaker real has raised the cost of imported goods and contributed to a small increase in inflation.
But the concerns over price increases are not responsible for most of the market's volatility.
Instead, investors are nervously awaiting the outcome of the presidential runoff election.

José Serra, the candidate favored by supporters of Brazil's centrist government, continued to trail Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the left-leaning Workers Party, in polls released over the weekend.

Mr. da Silva has provided few details of his plans for crucial positions at the central bank and finance ministry aside from insisting that Mr. Fraga, a former associate of the financier George Soros, must go.
Still, Mr. da Silva is thought to have warmed to the idea of granting greater independence to the central bank, according to a report over the weekend by a prominent columnist, Elio Gaspari.
The move could bring calm to the markets if the appointee is agreeable to investors.
Several people have been mentioned, including Henri Philippe Reichstul, whose experience in the 1970's with a revolutionary group brings him respect with some factions of the Workers Party.
Mr. Reichstul, an Oxford-educated economist, has since become one of Brazil's most respected business executives.

''A more independent central bank with the right person at its helm would be a striking example of the new government's wish for stability,'' said Murillo de Aragão, Brasília-based political consultant with LatinSource, a consulting firm in New York.
The sale in Rosslyn, involving a 343,000 square foot building that is 92 percent leased to a dozen primary tenants, is ''indicative of the transaction velocity and their market share,'' said Warren Dahlstrom, a broker in the Washington office of the commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield who worked on the sale.

''What these funds are doing is packaging them and selling them through some of the largest banks,'' Mr. Dahlstrom said.
The money enters United States real estate markets from Germany in two forms, closed-end funds and open-end funds.
Closed-end funds own one to three assets, and shares are sold to high-income investors for tens of thousands of dollars.
The investors must pay United States taxes, so their income of a few thousand dollars a year is taxed at a low rate, according Mr. Eckhardt of Ernst & Young.
These funds are largely unaffected by the regulatory changes.
For open-end funds, which have been amassing capital as investors anticipate improved returns from new flexibility allowed by the regulatory changes, the tax advantages alone are meager, and they have not changed in more than a decade.
The lack of tax advantages available to open-end funds indicates that their investors expect high returns for other reasons, including the new strategies available after the regulatory changes, tax experts said.

''The mutual funds do not go to the U.S. because of the tax treatment, they go because of the performance,'' said Thomas A. Eckhardt, a partner with the accounting firm Ernst & Young Germany who works in New York.

And they are finding more investors for their United States ventures.
There are about 20 registered open-end mutual funds in Germany that are required to maintain significant levels of liquidity because their shares are publicly traded and immediately redeemable.
By July 31, the funds had assets of 66.67 billion euros, or $65.7 billion, compared with assets of 50.81 billion euros, or $50.1 billion in the middle of 2001, according to Hans-Dieter Schulz-Gebeltzig, a partner who works in Frankfurt in the real estate practice of Linklaters, an international law firm based in London.

The open-end funds, most of which are managed by big German banks and insurance companies, are the primary beneficiaries of the changes, which became effective July 1.
They were previously limited to investing no more than 20 percent of their assets in real estate outside the European Economic Area.
The new law eliminates that limit, substituting a provision that the funds' exposure to currency fluctuations may not exceed 30 percent.
It also allows them to acquire minority interests in joint ventures and to invest up to 49 percent of their assets in majority share investments instead of only 20 percent.
Because of these German regulatory changes, in the United States, ''one, they will spend more money, and two, they will have more flexibility in the deals they do,'' said Jon Caplan, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield in the United States who has traveled to Germany to study the funds' strategies.
In the United States, the closed-end funds are primarily represented by three companies, all affiliates of German financial companies that make their United States headquarters in Atlanta.
One is Jamestown, which secures average investments of $50,000 from German investors to buy properties in the United States.
The TMW Real Estate Group, the seller in the Rosslyn deal, is affiliated with TMW Immobilien of Germany, and it manages closed-end funds as well as commingled funds for institutional investors.

For the last few decades, KanAm's activities in the United States have been mostly limited to providing capital to the Mills Corporation, the developer of suburban shopping malls.
KanAm manages closed-end funds, and last year it became the first private company to secure a license to manage an open-end fund.

These companies have been placing German investment capital in real estate in the United States for about 20 years, but the flow of capital slowed for the better part of the 1990's, first as investors turned to real estate opportunities in the former East Germany after reunification and then as they turned to the stocks of technology companies.
It has resumed as the currencies stabilized concurrent with a decrease in interest rates and stock markets in the United States and Europe.
''The strategy is to bring the money over and get an income return that can be 400 basis points higher than savings rates in Germany,'' said Mr. Barag of Lend Lease, using a term that means four percentage points.

As the capital amasses in these funds, some brokerage firms in the United States expect to see fund managers take an interest in a more diverse range of properties, partly because diversification is a tenet of the regulatory changes.
David C. Pahl, a senior vice president of TMW, said that open-end funds would have difficulty marketing assets in second-tier markets to their investors in Germany.
''They want to be able to identify with the tenants, they want to be able to identify with the city,'' Mr. Pahl said.

''The legislative change has been maybe overhyped,'' Mr. Zoukis said.
Even so, the closed-end fund managers are anticipating escalating prices for assets that German investors find favorable.
''There will be more capital coming into the U.S.,'' said Mr. Pahl of TMW.
''That just means more competition for everybody.''
Mr. Takenaka has been building a coalition that supports forcing the most-indebted lenders to accept public money.
The Bank of Japan, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and Japan's largest business lobby have all backed his efforts.

But the bankers' stiffening opposition makes it likely that Mr. Takenaka's advisory task force on the bad-loan problem will delay releasing its report, due this week, until next week to allow for more consultations.
In the meantime, the Koizumi government is expected to announce ''anti-deflationary'' measures on Friday intended to reassure the public that it is acting to offset the economic pain that would come with faster bad-debt write-offs.
Some tax breaks, loan guarantees and increases in unemployment benefits are possibilities, but their scope will be limited by Prime Minister Koizumi's promise to keep a lid on Japan's chronic budget deficit.
But their calculations are based on the current definitions of nonperformance and bank capital adequacy, and they oppose plans to tighten the definitions.

The bankers and their political backers are also pushing to expand the role of the Resolution and Collection Corporation, a government-sponsored agency that uses public money to buy some bad loans from the banks.
But the law that created the agency forbids it from taking losses on its operations, so it offers the banks very low prices for the loans and has not been able to dispose of many.

Bankers and many top lawmakers want the law changed to allow the agency to pay the banks more and then absorb the losses.
Experts say the Bank of Japan would be asked to finance the operations.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That approach would shift the cost of cleaning up the mess to taxpayers without reducing the banks' independence.
But it would also perpetuate the ''moral hazard'' that critics say kept earlier bank bailouts, in 1998 and 1999, from making any lasting dent in the bad-loan problem: the belief that the government will always help the banks in a crisis deters bankers from taking painful steps to head off or solve crises on their own.

''We're probably in the same scenario as in 1998, where the goal is financial sector stability, no matter how you get there,'' said Kathy Matsui, an equity strategist at Goldman, Sachs in Tokyo.
''The government will do just enough to get through this, and Takenaka's team will have to pray that it's enough.''
A compromise with the banks, Ms. Matsui said, might prop up stocks in the short term but would antagonize investors who had taken the government at its word and sold Japanese assets in anticipation of tough action.
Ms. Matsui and other analysts say the government must instead come up with a comprehensive solution that includes not only dealing with the bad loans but also steps to strengthen the social safety net, stop deflation and improve corporate profitability.
In the past, Japanese executives have been deeply reluctant to take such steps, but that stance is changing.
This year, the largest manufacturers have announced plans to close dozens of factories and lay off tens of thousands of workers.
Many construction, retail and real estate companies have also reached agreements with their bank lenders to exchange equity for their debts.

For all the progress, though, Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange owed 216 trillion yen ($1.7 trillion) in interest-bearing debts at the end of the fiscal year on March 31, equal to about 85 percent of the exchange's total market capitalization.
Though short-term interest rates have fallen close to zero, companies have managed to reduce their indebtedness over the last five years by just 8 percent.

The battle lines in this country culture clash, between those who call Jewett home and those who cherish it as a home away from home, emerged as early as January, at a town meeting prompted by letters from Mr. Middleton and his lawyer, Christopher Modelewski of Huntington, N.Y.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
At that meeting, the town lawyer, Tal Rappleyea, acknowledged that Ms. Beecher should have gone through a more extensive approval process for the kiln, and advised that she do so.
''Maybe it's my mountaintop upbringing,'' he said, according to minutes posted on the town's Web site, ''but I didn't want somebody from downstate telling me what we could and couldn't do.''
He commissioned a telephone survey asking residents their opinion on the matter.
And he mailed Jewett's second-home owners, who account for about two-thirds of the town's 1,100 homes, fliers announcing the formation of the Jewett Civic Association.

''Want this in front of your home???''
the flier asks, in a caption accompanying a photograph of the kiln.

The flier reads, ''By working together we can stop it, and then change a Town government, which treats 'nonresidents' as second class citizens.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The flier struck a chord.
Mr. Middleton said he has received dozens of telephone calls, e-mail messages and letters from second-home owners who are curious, concerned or irate.
''What I'm expressing is a concern that because of the popularity all of the sudden of the Catskills, that we don't have a situation where people will come and put a trailer right next to you, which I abhor, absolutely abhor,'' said Mrs. Douris, who lives in Manhattan.
''It's so quiet.
You can sleep.
You hear the birds.
It's just marvelous.
And as this area gets more and more populated, there's going to be problems.''

Janice T. Stubben, who owns land in Jewett, had similar concerns.
''You have visions of going away for the weekend, and you have this beautiful little hacienda, and then all of a sudden this monster is right next to you,'' Mrs. Stubben said, suggesting that Jewett take a page from her own village, Garden City, N.Y., where officials only recently backed down from an attempt to crack down on tall flagpoles.

Ms. Beecher only lives in Jewett four days a week, nine months a year; the rest of the time she and her husband, Mosa Havivi, live in Manhattan or Florida, where she teaches pottery classes.
And the Middletons' Catskills roots reach to 1847, when Mr. Middleton's great-grandfather arrived there from Ireland to work on quarries in Saugerties; one of Mr. Middleton's nephews sits on the town board.
There are certainly second-home owners who support the kiln, and a handful of full-time residents who oppose it.

Mr. Middleton, 62, the deputy director for the Department of Planning and Environment for Huntington, also claimed the kiln is a fire hazard.
He said outlawing the kiln would be best, not just for his family but also for the town itself.
''It's going to whet the appetite of people who will think that they can get away with things there that they couldn't get away with elsewhere,'' he said.
''Why build a home on a piece of property when uncontrolled development can occur on residentially zoned property adjacent to yours?''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Ms. Beecher is still prohibited from firing up the kiln.
The decision was made with the understanding that Ms. Beecher would enclose the kiln in a barnlike structure and plant more trees to obscure the view from the road.
Mr. Modelewski is appealing that decision, and Ms. Beecher still needs approval from the town planning board.
For her part, Ms. Beecher, 57, said she would like to come to a peaceful resolution.
She only planned to fire up the kiln -- which holds about 400 pieces, depending on the size -- five or six times a year in the first place, and would agree to choose ''mutually acceptable'' dates for the firing, which takes about 20 hours.

The kiln, built from 7,000 bricks and fed only clean scrap wood, is not antithetical to rural bliss, she said, but rather is the height of it.
''What is nature?''
''It's earth, fire and water, and that's what that is.''

Among Ms. Beecher's supporters are members of the Greene County arts community, who point to the Catskills' artistic tradition dating to the 1800's and the Hudson River School of painters.
She is also getting support from other potters, in the Catskills and elsewhere, some of whom have written the town letters testifying to the safety and significance of the kiln, a modernized version of an ancient Japanese design.

She has received support from many neighbors, who see it as a welcome addition to a town with one blinking traffic light and one store.
''She's an entrepreneur, it's America, and I think her pottery is very nice,'' said Linda Varelas, 58, a teacher who grew up in Jewett and still lives here, two doors down from her parents.
Her view is seconded by Harvey Edson, 61, the third-generation owner of Edson's General Store, which sells newspapers, groceries and used novels, and functions as a local gathering spot.

''She's a well-known artist,'' he said.
''Let her do her thing.''
Of the second-home owners, he added: ''They come up here and they want the country, but they want the city, too.
The country's nice and quiet, crime's down.
But then they want to change it.''

The tacit vote of confidence in Japan's strongest companies, however, was enough to help the yen rise to 124.90 against the dollar from 125.50.
Governments often have the highest debt ratings in their countries because they can print money and they do control the currencies that domestic residents hold.
In allowing companies to be rated higher than the government, Moody's is saying that the government is unlikely to restrict the flow of foreign currency during a financial crisis.

The steps come as Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, tries to put limits on a national debt that is expected to hit 133 percent of gross domestic product by March 2003.
In recent days, Mr. Koizumi has started to soften his pledge to cap new bond issuance at 30 trillion yen ($240 billion) a year.
But with the recovery losing steam and the banks groaning under the weight of $420 billion in nonperforming loans, the prime minister walks a fine line.
He is under pressure to force Japan's banks to write off their debts more quickly to improve the country's long-term prospects.
To ease the burden that such a write-off will probably cause, though, the government will try to enact a package of tax cuts and other antideflationary measures later this week.
If Mr. Koizumi breaks his self-imposed spending cap yet fails to make progress on reform, conditions could deteriorate further.

''It is inevitable that Koizumi will abandon his spending cap,'' said Graeme Knowd, director of credit research at UBS Warburg in Tokyo.
''But if he relaxes spending and does nothing with the banks, the country will get downgraded.''
Some companies, however, continue to grow despite the government's problems.

Record-low interest rates and generous government-sponsored bailouts have allowed Japanese companies to pay down their debts and stockpile cash even as the domestic economy weakens.
Even though banks have cut lending for 57 consecutive months, Japanese companies are generating about 22 trillion yen ($176 billion) in free cash each year, according to Credit Suisse First Boston calculations.
Now, anyone buying a car or truck should learn about incentives, just as they have learned about warranties.

Cash Back or Low Financing?
These days, the talk is about the ''zero-zero,'' or loans that are 0.0 percent.
''They are providing 'zero-zero,' but if you don't want to, you don't have to make your first payment for 90 days.
It is still a 36-month or 48-month or 60-month loan, but you make three fewer payments at a slightly higher amount.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
On most models with incentives, though, you can choose whether to take the low financing or a cash give-back.
The online automotive information service Edmunds.com has a calculator on its Web site that lets consumers determine the difference between the two.
Go to www.edmunds.com, click on ''financing'' and click again on ''low APR vs. cash back'' under ''financial calculators.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But be forewarned that not all ''zero-zeros'' are alike.
Sometimes, the zero percent financing is available only on 36-month loans, while the standard car loan nowadays is 48 or 60 months.
Therefore, your monthly payment may be substantially the same either way if you get a fairly low rate on the longer-term financing.
Further, according to figures gathered by Edmunds, only 35 percent of customers meet the financial requirements to qualify for the zero percent deals, especially for the longer-term ones.

''Cash just winds up being better for most people,'' said Philip Reed, the consumer advice editor at Edmunds.
''If you are playing with $3,000, it's hard to go wrong.''
Leasing
Generally, fewer incentives are being offered for leasing than for buying cars.
In fact, auto leasing has dropped considerably in recent years; five years ago, 35 percent of new cars were leased, compared with 23 percent this year so far.
''Zero financing enticed people to buy, even people who were not really thinking about buying a car this year,'' said Jesse Toprak, manager of pricing and market analysis at Edmunds.
According to Mr. Honiotes of Autobytel, Toyota had its best month in sales this August in the 45 years it has been selling cars in the United States.

''But there still are very few incentives for leases,'' he said.
''Having said that, because a lease is still tied to an interest rate and interest rates are down on everything, for a customer who understands leasing, this is a great time.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Actually, this may be a better time for a customer coming off a lease who wants to buy the car, he said, because manufacturers have recently overestimated the residual value of many leased vehicles.
The residual value is the best guess as to what the car will be worth at the end of the lease, based on data from past models and other factors, and it is negotiated at the outset of the lease.
But the estimate may be off in a softer used-car market.
''If you are coming off-lease,'' Mr. Honiotes said, try to renegotiate a lower residual value.
''It will be a car you know, and I'm betting that a lot of dealers will go for it.
They don't want that car on the lot.''
What You Won't Get
Don't expect to find incentives on hot-selling vehicles.
The Honda Odyssey minivan, with a suggested ''starting'' price of $24,400 at the Honda Web site (www .hondacars.com), has no rebate offers.
In addition, Honda has shied away from cash-back offers because the company thinks they tarnish the brand's image, according to Mr. Libby of J. D. Power.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
''Specialty vehicles, like Ford Thunderbirds, won't have them,'' Mr. Honiotes said.
''Nissan has some exciting products, like the new 350Z, so you won't find that with incentives.
High-end sports cars don't do much.
Our recommendation is to wait a few months.
See how something is selling.
If there aren't any rebates, well, you haven't lost anything.
And you may find yourself with some incentives.''
It is always a good idea to check Web sites before you go into a dealer.
Edmunds has a list of general rebates -- Porsche, for example, extends a $500 rebate to members of its car club.
Edmunds also has a geographical index.
You plug in your ZIP code and find a list of cars that are being sold with incentives at dealers nearby.

''It is important to point out that the incentive business is determined by geography,'' said Mr. Reed of Edmunds.
''I would never make a blanket statement about a rebate and have someone barge in and ask for something that a dealer may not provide.''
While luxury cars are not likely to carry incentives, sometimes there are special situations.
''E-Classes are around invoice or below these days because of it,'' Mr. Toprak said.

Prices Versus Incentives
A skeptical consumer might ask, ''If they raise prices on cars, what good is an incentive?''
But there is little evidence that new car prices have risen considerably lately or that they will rise significantly soon.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
''We don't see much chance we will raise prices until, at least, the economy improves,'' said Paul Ballew, the chief industry sales analyst at the General Motors Corporation.
''We've had great competition and, in some cases, overcapacity at factories.
And no one is getting rid of incentives.
Sure, we'd prefer to not use incentives, but such is life.''
Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said that European cars might increase in price, but only because of dollar fluctuations.
''Especially cars coming out of Germany, which have high costs of production there, may go up in price,'' he said.
Most Honda sedans and Toyotas sold here are made in North America, so the yen-dollar relationship may have minimum effect on pricing.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
''Actually, the transaction prices have been deflationary over the last few years,'' Mr. Jackson of AutoNation said.
''There is intense competition among domestic manufacturers for market share, which they believe is important in the long run.
That is why they will give an incentive, even if it cuts into profits.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
''Now the customer has had 15 years of incentives, so I think they are here for good.
Whoever takes it away will feel the disinterest of the consumer rather directly.
It's a great time to be a buyer.''
Do Some Homework, Then Go and Dicker
INCENTIVES to buy cars are wonderful, but consumers should remember to do some research beforehand.
The following are tips from the experts:
Negotiate the price first, then bring up the incentive.
''Incentives are a tool to adjust prices,'' said Tom Libby of J. D. Power & Associates, the car industry research firm.
He said that because most people buy a car with financing, the most important thing may not be the price but the monthly payment juxtaposed against the buyer's income.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Do not walk in with overly optimistic projections.
''The average customer expects a 10 percent discount on a vehicle,'' said Paul Ballew of the General Motors Corporation.
''I think that is rational.
Seventy percent of buyers now have accessed the Internet for information.
They are more informed, which means they get better deals.
But it also means they know what dealers can't give them.''
Watch out for dealer add-ons.
''A lot of people haggle for a day or two for $100 and then buy an extended warranty for $500,'' said Jesse Toprak of Edmunds.com ''I'm not saying an extended warranty is never worthwhile, but it isn't if you don't want it.
And it certainly may negate whatever incentive you get.''
If there is a listing for an alarm installed by a dealer that you do not want or a bogus-looking fee on the warranty, Mr. Toprak said, don't buy that car; chances are there is a car free of such extras at the lot.
Think seriously about how long you want to keep the car.
The strange statistic in car-buying these days is that, according to Edmunds, the average person keeps a vehicle for 39 months, but arranges a loan of 54 to 55 months.
If you do not think you will be keeping the car for the longer term, Mr. Toprak advises taking a cash rebate and buying a newer model -- a 2003 if you are buying now.
If you are planning to keep the car for years, resale value is not as important.
Buy a 2002 model, then, with a lower price and take out a long, zero-percent loan.

But researchers say that the Rutgers study is one of the most ambitious attempts in the nation to pull all those strings together into one regional model.
Half of the project looks back at how population growth and the sprawl of development over the last century have made for a different weather pattern.
The project's other half looks forward, at how the state's communities and residents could be affected by long-term climate change as a result of local land-use decisions in years to come.

The idea is not that New Jersey is an island, the researchers say, making its own little weather in splendid isolation, or that the global atmospheric system doesn't matter, but rather that in the end, weather and climate is like politics: it's all local.
People and climate connect not in equations or theories, but on the ground.
''Say you build a new 100-acre development and then you get 10 inches less precipitation than normal -- what will be the effect of that?''
said Ying Fan Reinfelder, an assistant professor of geology who is working on the water-flow portion of the climate model.
''What's the effect on ground water, and on stream flow?
One side of this is climate; the other are man-made changes.
We want to link them.''
The Rutgers project, which is partly financed by the state's Department of Environmental Protection, has huge potential implications for the debate about open space and suburban sprawl, state officials and environmentalists say.
If a housing development or a new shopping center can be scientifically linked to regionwide effects on water supply or weather, for example, then the battles over development and zoning that now seem purely local will be transformed.
Regulators and courts will have a powerful new scientific tool, they say, as global warming becomes an aspect of urban planning becomes an aspect of politics.

''We've long known that better land-use practices reduce the costs of cleaning up our water and cleaning up our air,'' said Bradley M. Campbell, New Jersey's commissioner of environmental protection.
''This work makes clear that good land-use policy is essential to stabilizing our long-term climate, as well.''

Environmentalists say that the interconnections are the key, because the model is expected to show how residents many miles from a proposed development project can be affected by something they had perhaps never even heard of.

''A study like this can really change the way we think about land use in New Jersey,'' said Barbara L. Lawrence, executive director of New Jersey Future, a research and planning organization that focuses on development issues.
''To the extent that science can document changes that go way beyond the border of a municipality, you can build a case for more regional planning.''

Scientists who are leading the project say that their ultimate goal is to produce a kind of scientific tool kit that planners could use to envision, through the grinding out of a few hundred million equations, multiple versions of the state's future based on land-use and climate trends.
''Once we get our tools working, we can say, 'What if the future of New Jersey 100 years from now is this, or what if it's this other plan -- how will that affect the climate?'
''We'll be able to do those experiments in the next couple years and maybe that can give information to policy makers that will actually help them decide what the future development will be like.''

But there are historical puzzles to be pondered, as well, and that's where the old map and the graduate student figure in.
The Cook map -- really multiple maps created over nine years -- is 17 feet long when fully assembled and only a bit less accurate than a photograph taken from space.
Paul Stuart Wichansky's Ph.D. dissertation is aimed at figuring out how the changes since Professor Cook's time have altered the state's climate.

The computer, stocked with all that science knows about how land conditions can alter wind and water evaporation and runoff and albedo (how different surfaces reflect or retain heat), will replay history.
Mr. Wichansky spent a year in the Rutgers Library creating a digital version of the Cook map that could be fed into the school's climate modeling program.
He has just started his computer runs.

''I feel like Prof. George H. Cook is speaking to me through his maps,'' Mr. Wichansky said.
At the backdrop of the climate work here is the unavoidable reality that a record-breaking warm trend -- short-term or long-term, no one can say -- is under way.
''The land cover change project may enable us to quantify how much of this warming may actually be due to changes in the land surface itself as a result of human modifications,'' he said.
Some New Jersey environmental officials say they think that the results of the Rutgers project will be illuminating about how land and climate fit together, but that information, in the end, might still be problematic.

''It's one thing for the state to say you have to control this amount of polluted runoff,'' one senior state official said.
''It's another to say you have to maintain this forest cover or this result will occur far away.
That's not the traditional bailiwick of environmental regulation.
We'll have to evolve ourselves to get to that point.''
Early in the movie, young Frida (Salma Hayek) shows up for her sister's wedding portrait dressed in a man's gray flannel suit, sending up propriety to the delight of her father (Roger Rees) and the chagrin of her mother (Patricia Reyes Spindola).
Too often, ''Frida'' squeezes its carnal spirit into respectable clothes, enacting the artistic compromise that is one of its themes.
It's a staid film biography that wants most desperately to be a musical -- to bracket its subject's name between gratuitous exclamation points.
(The most moving, most memorable scenes are in essence musical numbers, including a torrid tango danced by Ms. Hayek and Ashley Judd that is reason enough to see the movie.)

Ms. Taymor, the theater and puppet artist who brought ''The Lion King'' to Broadway and, in her filmmaking debut, turned Shakespeare's ''Titus Andronicus'' into a piece of grisly, glorious performance art, has a brilliant sense of spectacle.
''Frida,'' which opens today in New York and Los Angeles, begins with a tour of the artist's courtyard garden, where monkeys and peacocks wander among the flowering cactuses.
Suddenly, a narrow canopy bed seems to float into the frame, carried like a coffin out into the street -- an image worthy of Gabriel García Márquez.
And ''Frida'' is at its best when it forsakes earnest psychological exposition for magic realism, when, instead of trying to explain Kahlo's life, it conjures the moods and sensations that fed her art.
After the deathbed prologue, we encounter Frida as an ardent, headstrong teenager, intoxicated by art, sex and left-wing politics -- spying on the great muralist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) as he seduces a model, stealing off for a broom-closet tryst with her boyfriend (Diego Luna) and arguing Marxist dialectics on a crowded city bus.
That bus is also the scene of her first great catastrophe, an accident (filmed with surreal, hallucinatory intensity) in which her back and pelvis are horribly injured.
The second catastrophe, as she puts it later in a moment of disillusionment, was her entanglement with Rivera, an established artist 21 years her senior (and judging from Ms. Hayek and Mr. Molina, at least twice her size), whom she married in 1929.

As the movie presents it, their relationship -- formed from an alloy of political fervor, professional respect and sexual hunger -- was certainly volatile.
Shortly after their wedding, Frida discovers that one of Diego's previous wives is living upstairs, cooking the chicken mole that helps stoke his creative fires.
And his appetite for sex exceeds his appetite for food: he promises Frida loyalty but not fidelity.
What is mole for the gander, however, is mole for the goose and Frida takes on an impressive array of lovers, both men and women, including Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush), Josephine Baker and a willowy New Yorker (Saffron Burrows) who had also been one of Diego's conquests.
Ms. Hayek and Mr. Molina are both wonderfully charismatic, but their scenes of recrimination and reconciliation have a dull, actorly flavor that makes the characters seem smaller than life.
Although Frida and Diego's bumpy marriage is the narrative heart of the movie, its emotional core resides elsewhere, in Ms. Taymor's captivating disregard of the boundary between fantasy and reality.
The bus accident is followed by an eerie animated sequence whose iconography of skeletons and broken body parts comes from Kahlo's painting and from the Mexican folk art that fascinated her.
Later, Ms. Taymor renders New York in the 30's as a Dadaist collage complete with paper-doll Fridas and Diegos, and inserts them into scenes from the old ''King Kong.''
Much of Kahlo's later work consisted of self-portraits, and Ms. Taymor ingeniously incorporates these vivid, frightening pictures into the film.

The further it strays from sober naturalism, the better ''Frida'' is.
The parade of historical celebrities -- Trotksy, André Breton (the balding fellow with the pipe), Nelson Rockefeller (Edward Norton) -- is matched by a steady stream of movie stars enjoying florid cameos and trying out silly accents.
Ms. Judd, playing the photographer Tina Modotti, bends her usual Kentucky accent around phrases like ''Basta!''
and ''Viva la Revolución!
''; Mr.
Rush speaks Russian like the Australian he is.
So much the better.
Frida Kahlo was no realist, and neither, despite her occasional dutiful, desultory efforts, is Ms. Taymor.

Perhaps to signal that he does not have as much influence over North Korea as the White House hopes, he told reporters that he had been ''completely in the dark'' about North Korea's secret nuclear project.

''We are at the beginning of a campaign to mobilize the world against this program, and I think we are making good progress,'' the official said, adding later that he expects a ''strong statement'' from the United States, South Korea and Japan on Saturday after Mr. Bush, on the edges of the Asian economic summit conference in Mexico, meets the leaders of both countries for the first time since the North Korean disclosure.
The administration was happy to hear Mr. Jiang declare, in very blunt terms today, that ''China has always held the position that the Korean peninsula ought to be nuclear weapons-free.''
One official described the emerging American strategy this way: "We play the bad cop, the Chinese play the good cop, and the Japanese potentially play the sugar daddy whose investment in North Korea is at stake.''

Today a sturgeon in the Caspian sea -- home to the highest concentration of the fish in the world -- would have to run a veritable obstacle course to lay its eggs.
It would have to escape the fishermen trolling the Caspian's waters, find its way into the delta, evade the nets and hooks of the many poachers who lurk there, and then swim upriver hundreds of miles, if, that is, it manages to survive the ravages of pollution and doesn't find its path blocked by a dam.

Similarly zealous overfishing effectively wiped out American sturgeon in the Delaware River at the turn of the 20th century (between 1890 and 1897 alone, the catch in that river dropped by half, so decimated were the sturgeon populations), and European sturgeon in the Elbe.

''If the hatcheries remain dormant and the poaching keeps up at the same pace,'' Ms. Saffron writes, ''the Caspian sturgeon could soon go the way of the sturgeon of North America and Europe.''
In recent years it has been democratized, turned into what Ms. Saffron calls ''a mass-marketed delicacy for the middle class'' sold in yuppie grocery stores and over the Internet.

Although much of the information in this book about the threatened extinction of the sturgeon is familiar from newspaper and magazine articles, Ms. Saffron has done a nimble job of dramatizing it in the most vivid of terms, leaving the reader with a understanding of how the fate of a fish has been determined by the vicissitudes of politics and business, by technological advances and shifting cultural appetites.

According to Bridgewater Associates, an investment manager, interest rates now imply that traders are giving the Federal Reserve a 90 percent chance of lowering the federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 1.5 percent from 1.75 percent next week.

Despite that, David Malpass, chief economist of Bear, Stearns, cautioned against reading too much into yesterday's report.
''This report probably is a neutral for the Fed,'' he said, adding that today's report on employment from the Labor Department should have a stronger influence on the board.

Other economists predicted that the Fed would wait before lowering rates again.
''My guess is that they'll probably stick to their guns, unless they know something we don't know,'' said Mark Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University.
''They have to be vigilant, but the situation doesn't seem desperate.''
Indeed, the rate of economic growth in the third quarter fell to a range that would have been considered quite healthy before the Internet boom of the late 1990's.
But despite strong improvements in crucial economic matters like productivity and corporate profits, worries about accounting scandals and a possible war with Iraq have eclipsed economic fundamentals in the minds of some consumers, Mr. Harris said.
''This is nervousness well beyond what the official data on the economy suggests they should have,'' he said.

Mr. Harris added that the allure of interest-free financing for cars and other big-ticket items was beginning to fade.
Now, Mr. Harris said, ''they can't even get sales up to normal levels.''

Many forecasters expected the economy to expand by 3.5 percent or 4 percent in the third quarter, far outpacing the second quarter's meager rate of 1.3 percent, before weakening in the fourth quarter.
That said, the summer's lower-than-expected growth could suggest a slight lift for the future.
''The lowness of inventories coming out of the third quarter ends up being a timing shift,'' he said.
''You subtract some from third quarter, and you add it to the fourth quarter.''

It may take more than a small boost to loosen corporate purse strings, Mr. Harris said.
''Every component of business behavior is slowing instead of accelerating.
They're just saying: 'We don't want to buy.
We don't want to get out there and hire.'
''
Although overall business investment is no longer declining, investment in commercial buildings like factories, offices and warehouses fell 16 percent during the summer, the fourth consecutive double-digit quarterly decline.
Companies may be content to sit on their current assets, Professor Gertler suggested, so the lag before the recovery appears robust may be longer than those after previous recessions.
In any case, he said, ''it's way too early to panic.''
Last year, the Fed reduced the rate -- currently at 1.75 percent -- 11 times to lower the cost of borrowing and encourage new spending by businesses and consumers.
The Fed has kept the rate steady this year in the hope, now fading, that the economy was solidly recovering from last year's recession.

Hoping to make the kind of gains opposition parties often do during economic slowdowns, Democrats used yesterday's report to criticize President Bush's economic leadership.
Republicans responded that they could best improve job growth by capturing control of the Senate as well as the House, enabling them to pass a new round of tax cuts.
With terrorism and a possible war in Iraq occupying much of the political debate, however, the economy might not prove to be as important an issue as it has in the past, members of both parties said.
''It hasn't gotten to that kind of red-hot issue yet, but the mood is one of foreboding,'' said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island.

R. Glenn Hubbard, a top economic adviser to Mr. Bush, commented: ''Things aren't getting worse, but they aren't getting noticeably better.''

Last month, manufacturers eliminated 49,000 jobs, the 27th straight monthly cut by the sector, which now employs fewer workers than it has at any point since 1961.
Reinforcing a sense that the industrial sector is suffering more than it was during the summer, a survey of supply-chain managers released yesterday indicated that manufacturing activity fell in October for the second month in a row.
''The economy has lost considerable momentum,'' said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis.
''It's clearly taking longer for it to rebound than a lot of people had thought initially.''
Government agencies helped, too, adding 24,000 employees.

Stocks rose yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 120 points, or 1.44 percent, to close at 8,517.64.
Some analysts argue that the Fed should act more aggressively and cut rates by a half-point next week, rather than taking small steps that might fail to jump-start the economy.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and many of his colleagues have been reluctant to act again, believing that last year's cuts will continue to help growth in coming months.

Since the beginning of last year, the economy has lost 1.7 million jobs, or about 1 percent of the nation's total, according to the Labor Department.
Those three elections happened in the middle of a Republican president's term, as is the case this year, and Democrats gained even more seats in those elections than is typical for the opposition party in a midterm election.

Yesterday's jobs report offered them one more opportunity to fault Mr. Bush for this job downturn.
''The administration tends to ignore these economic issues,'' said Mr. Reed, the senior Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee.
''The same effort and imagination he applies to other areas should be applied to the economy.''
Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina, said the party would extend unemployment insurance and consider cutting taxes and increasing public works spending if it gained control of the House and kept control of the Senate.
Most Republicans oppose new spending, including the extension of jobless benefits.
A Republican-controlled Congress could create jobs by passing more tax cuts and a terrorism-insurance bill, he said.

Either way, however, ''we are in for a bumpy next few months,'' Mr. Hubbard said.
The average weekly earnings of hourly workers, who make up about 80 percent of the work force, fell 46 cents, to $507.75, according to the Labor Department, which adjusts the numbers to account for normal seasonal variations.
Before companies begin hiring large numbers of permanent workers, they often add to their temporary work force.

''There's no indication the economy is getting liftoff speed,'' said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
While these partnerships give consumers more opportunities to add points or miles to their reward programs, they may not be the best way to shop for mortgages, experts say.
And some states restrict the use of mileage for certain transactions.
Most of the lenders involved in such partnerships are among the largest in the country, and ''they're not noted for their particularly aggressive pricing,'' said Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm in Butler, N.J.

Despite the added perks, the mileage deals have yet to take hold in a big way.
Randy Petersen, the publisher of InsideFlyer, a magazine specializing in travel loyalty programs, estimates that only 51,000 frequent fliers, out of a total of 20 million active program members, have participated in mortgage deals.

''People's habit typically is to read their local newspaper about refinancing, and to refinance with someone they know locally,'' he said.
''And the programs haven't been around in a refinancing boom like this; this is something relatively new.''

Mr. Petersen said that the vast majority of the mortgage program participants struck their deals in the last 18 months, a time of generally declining interest rates.
Many airlines and travel companies have included some information about the programs in mailings to members.
But that may not be enough.
''I'm in the dark about the programs,'' said Hugh F. Kelly, a real estate consultant from Brooklyn who is a member of the loyalty programs at Delta, American and Hilton.
''Once you know about them, you have to go through multiple levels of clicking on their Web sites to get to them, and you also have to know exactly what you're looking for.
The programs are hobbled by their presentation.''
''Even though these offers are very attractive, most frequent-flier program statements are loaded with offers, and they're lost in the blur.''

For example, the frequent-flier program of American Airlines alone has partnerships with more than 125 companies in a wide range of industries, in addition to its arrangements with Countrywide Home Loans and Cendant Mobility Real Estate Services.
ONE of the largest programs is run by Lending Tree, which acts as an exchange for 189 lenders and 650 real estate brokerage companies.
The company and its five airline partners offer miles for both loans (mortgages, refinancing and home equity) and real estate transactions -- the actual buying and selling of the home.
Frequent fliers get 1,250 miles for every $10,000 of a loan; in addition, if they buy or sell through Lending Tree, they get 3,000 miles for every $10,000 of its price.

Lending Tree also has different bonus programs for participants in the Six Continents travel loyalty program, which is for guests of Holiday Inn, InterContinental and Crowne Plaza hotels, and for participants in American Express Membership Rewards, who receive points only for buying and selling homes.
Mortgage partners with programs similar to Lending Tree's include E-Loan, Bank of America, Countrywide, GMAC Mortgage and U.S. Bank Home Mortgage.
In addition to its program for real estate transactions, American Express has arrangements through Membership Rewards and its banking unit with PHH Mortgage Services.
Diners Club works with CitiMortgage, allowing members to redeem points to cover the closing costs of a mortgage and receive other mortgage-related discounts.

Real estate companies with travel deals include GMAC Real Estate, Cendant, PMP Relocation Services and Delta Corporate Services.

TO find out if their travel loyalty programs participate in such deals, consumers can check their Web sites; they usually list all the participating partners, including real estate and mortgage companies.
The deals can be arranged online or offline, depending on the company.
But there are some caveats.
First, the offers are sometimes limited.
GMAC Real Estate, for example, caps its bonuses at 125,000 miles, while home-equity offers through GMAC Mortgage are not available in certain states.
Members of the American Airlines frequent-flier program who decide to buy a home through Cendant are restricted to brokers in its real estate network, most of whom are affiliated with Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and ERA, all Cendant brands.
In addition, the laws of some states -- including New Jersey, Kansas, Kentucky, Nevada and Oregon -- prohibit deals that feature miles for the actual purchase or sale of homes, though they are allowed for mortgage deals.

Then there's the matter of redeeming mileage awards for free airline tickets or other rewards.
Airlines sometimes impose blackout dates and other restrictions, particularly to popular destinations like Florida.

Greg Cassity, 37, an information technology consultant and member of Delta's frequent-flier program, says that is one of his concerns.
He recently received nearly 250,000 bonus miles for selling one house and buying another in suburban Atlanta through Lending Tree.
Mr. Cassity said he wants to redeem the miles for two Delta tickets to Ireland for himself and his wife, Sheryl, 41, a finance manager at Coca-Cola.
He also hopes to get free airline tickets for other family members.
But he said he has had problems in the past with blackout dates and seat availability when he has tried to redeem miles on short notice.
''My only reservation going forward is on the Delta side -- how much trouble I will have booking flights using SkyMiles,'' he said.

Mr. Petersen of InsideFlyer said mileage redemption has not been a problem for most travelers this year.
''Airlines have not cut back the number of free awards,'' he said.
''More frequent fliers are using awards in a fragile economy.''

Ultimately, said Douglas G. Duncan, the chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, people considering a loan through a travel loyalty program should thoroughly research and shop for the best rates -- and analyze their personal needs.
''If the consumer is the kind of person who never travels anywhere, this is not the right product,'' he said.
But for those who like to travel, ''it might well make sense.''

''If all is equal, and one lender as a last effort throws in the frequent-flier miles,'' he said, ''that may well tip the balance to that lender offering the best deal.''

The house-price boom -- concentrated in the Northeast and California -- is also creating significant new social divisions in the metropolitan areas affected, separating younger families from older ones and making some towns less diverse.
In Milton, Mass., for example, a grade-school teacher recently wrote to the town planning board asking it to create affordable housing, so she could move from her home 40 minutes away and more often attend Little League games and concerts where she teaches.
''People who haven't been in on the game find that the opportunity to own is a moving target that's moving further away from them,'' said Karl E. Case, an economist at Wellesley College and a co-founder of a real-estate research company that is now called Fiserv CSW.
''It's creating inequality.
It's creating more stratified communities.''
Around Boston, where house prices have doubled in the last five years, a family making the local median income of $61,000 can afford the monthly payments on a house worth only half the median price of $395,000.
This is true even though the annual interest rate on a typical mortgage fell to a four-decade low last month, before inching back above 6 percent.
In the mid-1990's, a median income allowed the purchase of nearly a median-priced house, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.

For families who own homes, of course, the surge in house prices and fall in mortgage rates have often brought a windfall, in the form of refinanced loans and lower monthly payments.
Many consumers have spent the extra money on new cars and other products, preventing last year's recession from being worse than it was, economists say.

But homeowners will ultimately be affected as well by the growing number of people priced out of hot housing areas.
With fewer potential buyers entering the market at the bottom, the sharp run-up in home values may be nearing an end, not only here in Boston but also in New York, Denver, Minneapolis, nearly every large city in California, and other places where prices have greatly outstripped incomes.

Already, the national home ownership rate, after rising steadily since 1994, has leveled off and fallen slightly over the last year when it reached a record high 68.1 percent.
Here in the Boston region, only about 59 percent of families own their homes, and the proportion has dropped a little during the last five years of rapid price gains.
To be sure, prices of the most expensive homes in and around Boston, New York and a few other big cities have lately begun to slip, brokers say.
But they add that most house prices continue to rise in spite of the lingering economic slowdown.
Even if the home market softens soon, most renters here will not be able to afford houses that they could have bought five years ago with less savings than they have today.

''I wish I had bought long, long, long ago,'' said Kelly P. Diamond, an administrator at a Boston-area university who rents a one-bedroom apartment in the city's North End, a neighborhood she said she would have to leave when she does buy an apartment.
''I try not to dwell on it, but when I think about it, it's definitely upsetting.''

The rapid price increases have been caused by the low mortgage rates, immigration, the aging of the population, and a widespread feeling that real estate is the new can't-miss investment, among other factors.
The boom has been strongest in California and the Northeast, where land is often scarce and cities are seen to be much healthier than they were in previous decades.
Throughout much of the rest of the country, particularly in the South and Midwest, the decline in mortgage rates has kept first homes as affordable as they were in past years.
In Chicago, Las Vegas and Richmond, Va., for example, prices have increased only moderately faster than incomes since the mid-1990's, according to Economy.com.
In the Dallas region, home prices and incomes have grown at roughly the same rate, making the typical home effectively less expensive today than it was seven or eight years ago, once mortgage rates are taken into account.
In a few places, including Rochester and Pittsburgh, incomes have actually increased more rapidly than house prices.

But in California, the Northeast and other hot housing cities like Denver, renters say they feel some of the same pangs of regret that were common among investors who missed out on the run-up in stock prices during the late 1990's.
Moreover, the consequences of missing the real-estate boom seem harsher, since some people have moved out of neighborhoods they like and instead begun commuting from faraway suburbs, like New Hampshire towns that are an hour's drive from Boston.

People who already own homes, by contrast, are able to use their earlier investment to maintain their standard of living if they move.
Once on the home ownership ladder, many people use their homes to improve their position.
Some of Ms. Diamond's friends who did buy apartments years ago have taken profits from selling them to buy much bigger units or to move into townhouses.
To save for a down payment, Ms. Diamond, who is in her mid-30's, has been cutting back on her travel and has decided not to buy a new car.
Still, she expects to be forced to move away from downtown, where she likes walking.
In the 12 months ended Sept. 1, only 28 two-bedroom apartments sold for less than $300,000 in the main residential neighborhoods near Boston's center, while 85 sold for more than $1 million, according to Link, a company that tracks listings.
Three years earlier, 265 apartments sold for less than $300,000 and 14 sold for more than $1 million.

The biggest price increases have probably ended around Boston, brokers say.

Indeed, many renters remain eager to become buyers, convinced of the long-term financial and personal benefits of owning a home.
Classes for aspiring homeowners offered by the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance are more popular than ever, said Thomas Callahan, the group's executive director, but fewer of the course's graduates are buying homes afterward.

''I feel ready to lunge at any home in my price range, if I can find one in my price range,'' said Acia Heath, a graduate of a home-buying class who lives in Dorchester, a Boston neighborhood.
Together, she and her husband make about $70,000, and they are looking for a two-family house that costs no more than $280,000.
The most frustrating part of the search, many young renters say, is their feeling that the purchase of a home around many major cities has become more difficult despite the decline in interest rates.
''When you look at how incomes have changed and how home prices have changed, it doesn't line up.
It's very disheartening.''
Fed policy makers are not expected to disappoint such expectations.
But if policy makers reduce their benchmark rate just a quarter point, many investors who hoped for more could be disappointed, and the market could fall.
It is 26.41 points, or 1.9 percent, from the recent high of 1,422.95 on Aug. 22.
The Dow is still 482.04 points below its Aug. 22 close of 9,053.64, and the S.& P. index is still 54.35 points away from its recent peak of 962.70.
Until those levels are surpassed, investors and analysts will not be able to feel that the market has a stronger foundation than it had before the summer rally collapsed.

Investors still face doubts about the strength of the economy, even if the Fed reduces interest rates, because many economists expect growth in the fourth quarter to be close to a 1 percent annual rate after topping 3 percent in the third quarter.
In addition, there are still worries about terrorism and a potential war with Iraq.
And while the fear of corporate accounting and fraud scandals may have diminished, the problems surrounding the setting up of the new account oversight board may be worrying investors.
But one sign that the foundation may be a little more secure is the rebound in technology, which has been leading the comeback.

Five of them were among the top 10 worst-performing sectors through Oct. 9, but have rebounded.
Wireless services are up 110 percent; office electronics equipment are up 67 percent; computer storage and peripherals, up 48 percent; semiconductors, up 44 percent; and information technology consulting and services, up 42 percent.
''In order to get a sustainable rally going one of the thinks you need is the broad participation of technology,'' said William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston.

Economists had expected the action at the bank's monthly meeting because the domestic economy is strong but the global economy is unsteady.
The country's growth rate of 3 percent is the strongest among developed countries and its currency is at a three-year high against the United States dollar.
John Shaw (NYT)
Economists said the bank's nine-member monetary policy committee seemed more concerned that a reduction would raise inflation at a time when the British pound is at a four-year low, making imported goods more expensive.
Inflation has been above the bank's target of 2.5 percent for several months.
The current interest rate is the lowest in almost 48 years.

With 2 minutes 59 seconds left and the Celtics hopelessly out of it, Walker, sitting on the Boston bench, confronted the fan, who had been heckling him all night -- in fact he had been heckling Walker all season.

''This fan has been on me since I've been here, seven years,'' Walker said.
My family's in the stands, my family's watching.
They don't need to hear that.
You can talk to me, you can boo me all day; that's part of the game.
But don't say personal things, that's not right.''
Of course, there's more to Scott's comments about Boston fans than bluster.
There is deep history.
Scott sees Boston through a prism of the West Coast and his years with the Los Angeles Lakers.
In 1984, the Lakers lost to Boston, 4-3; in 1985, they beat the Celtics, 4-2.
In 1987, they beat Boston, 4-2.
Riley wrote, ''The Boston Mystique encourages the lowest common denominator of fan behavior.''
This is the mentality Scott experienced while with the Lakers, and he hasn't forgotten it as a head coach.
Everything that happens between the Celtics and the Nets triggers a flashback and a reaction.

Tonight, the Celtics' fans, who never had the chance to get in the game, began yelling ''Wife beater!''
Fans poured on the verbal abuse, not only to her but also to other Lakers' wives.

''I like the rivalry; I like this type of basketball, I really do,'' he said.
You get used to having that edge.
I remember Kareem punching a few fans my first year, '83.
Scott may have to retire, or win a title, before he forgets and forgives Boston fans for the taunts and barbs.
Scott is learning to be a head coach; he has done pretty well very fast.
There's a thin line between lighting a fire and being consumed by the flame.
He'll eventually tone down the rhetoric, and the Nets will carry themselves with the self-assurance of champions.

First they have to climb that mountain, and I say do it with flair.
Corruption, bungling, greed and changing financial standards have depleted it; now, there is no endowment left.
''Art Held Hostage'' -- a morality play masquerading as a legal thriller -- tells us what went wrong.
But the total depletion of the museum's coffers owes much to the interplay of racial, local and personal politics.

Telling the story presents an acutely uncomfortable predicament: because much of the trouble came from African-Americans associated with Lincoln, the narrative tends to sound racist.
Anderson, a contributing editor for The American Lawyer, makes an unrepentant case against those who ran Lincoln University and the Barnes Foundation, whom he depicts as generally disagreeable, grandiose and incompetent.
His arguments are persuasive, though he sometimes veers rather far; the evidence he mounts is not always horrifying enough to back up his tone of voice; and some of this reads as overprotested character assassination.
The two primary figures here are Niara Sudarkasa, president of Lincoln University from 1986 to 1998 and for a time a Barnes board member, and Richard Glanton, a member of the Lincoln board and president of the Barnes board from 1990 to 1998.
Sudarkasa is presented by Anderson as weak, acquisitive and commanding, and Glanton as blunt, dissimulating, profligate and charismatic.
Sudarkasa was constantly in trouble, fighting accusations of misappropriating Lincoln funds to completely renovate the university president's house and buy herself a fancy car, and of allowing her husband, the university's plant manager, to award work contracts virtually unsupervised.
But Glanton, a lawyer in a prestigious Philadelphia firm, is the villain of the piece.
In Anderson's account, Glanton swept onto the Barnes board like Genghis Khan, throwing out the established procedures of the institution and setting up a new order that served his interests entirely.
He fired the long-term security provider for the Barnes and hired another, without telling his board, allowing his enemies to accuse him of doing it to strengthen his hand in local politics.
He chose a lawyer for one of the Barnes's legal actions (to the tune of $448,127.01) who would later become one of his major supporters at his law firm.

When he had transferred bank funds without board approval and was challenged in writing by a board member, he wrote back, ''This acknowledges your memorandum objecting to the Foundation's funds being deposited in the United Bank, the only African-American bank in Philadelphia.''
When opposition to the diversion of money from the Barnes to Lincoln University mounted, Glanton replied, ''They are saying black institutions shouldn't be allowed to benefit from relationships which exist.''

He pushed the tactic to its limit in a fight over a parking lot for the Barnes Collection.
Neighbors in the residential suburb where the Barnes is located did not relish having their roads crowded, and invoked a zoning ordinance to block the construction of the parking lot.

The enormously expensive legal actions Glanton initiated are dizzying.
Although Rome lost its case, little Glanton did seems to have been free of ugly wrangling.

Much of the story hinges on Glanton's relationship with Sudarkasa.
With her support, Glanton could just about keep running the show; there were five Barnes trustees, and one other vote could carry the day.
''Art Held Hostage'' leaves them roiling in their final obscurity, while the new leaders of the Barnes, Anderson writes, turn to white-dominated foundations to save them.
Sadly, this whole story, though enticingly intricate, is ultimately rather boring.
The idea of human pettiness may be shattering, but the details of pettiness are dull at best.
The book presents a litany of he-said-she-said arguments and catalogs of depositions and board minutes.
Though he is an adequate writer, Anderson seems to have bogged himself down in the mundane and melodramatic, and doesn't have the perspective to treat his tale as poignant allegory.
''Richard,'' Sudarkasa says, ''wanted to walk with the big boys.''
Another trustee explains: ''The bottom line was all ego.
To act in this desperate way out of a lust for power over paintings, even some great paintings, seems ludicrous and sad.
This is a bonfire of second-rate vanities, which reads best as a portrait of a man pathetic not only for his aspirations, but also because he is clearly smart enough to have done something better.
(Several articles since 1991 have also variously misstated those figures as well as the number of works by Matisse.)

There are 59 Matisses, not 60.
As he campaigns, Mr. Kirchner notes with pride that his province, Santa Cruz, has the lowest unemployment and infant mortality rates in Argentina.
True to the Peronist tradition of focusing social programs on the poor, he has also set up an extensive public housing program, which allows families earning as little as $200 a month to buy their own homes with payments of less than $30 a month.

With revenues from oil and gas, Mr. Kirchner has also invested heavily in infrastructure.
His government has built a network of modern hospitals with free consultations and medicine for the poor, a deep-water port to attract the fishing industry, airports to encourage tourism and a network of highways, all without plunging Santa Cruz into debt.
His detractors argue that the remarkably healthy financial situation of the remote province is unique, not only because of the oil and gas boom but also because its population is sparse -- fewer than 200,000 people in an area half the size of France.

Some of the money, however, has also gone into swelling the state bureaucracy: more than one-quarter of the provincial government's budget goes to salaries for civil servants.
More than 40 percent of job holders in the province are government employees.
They earn the highest average salary among provincial employees in the country according to a recent study, $521 a month.

''Kirchner's whole government plan is to hand out jobs and other favors so that he will have a subservient, captive vote,'' said Omar Muñiz, a provincial legislator who belongs to a different faction of the Peronist movement.
''In the small towns, people have become afraid to run on our ticket because they fear they will lose their jobs or suffer other reprisals.''

The strongest criticism has come over the way Mr. Kirchner has managed the revenues flowing from both petroleum production and privatization of the state oil company.
That money, more than $500 million, was deposited not in Argentine banks but abroad, first in the United States and then in Luxembourg and Switzerland, raising questions of accountability.

''By law, he has to account for that money, but there has been an absolute lack of transparency,'' said Roberto Giubetich, an opposition member of the province's legislative assembly.
''He has never declared to the appropriate organs of state, for instance, how much money is deposited abroad, in what banks, what interest rates it is earning, or what bonds he has bought or investments have been made.''
Mr. Kirchner has spent much of this week out of the country, meeting with the presidents of Brazil and Chile.
But Héctor Icazuriaga, the speaker of the provincial legislative and acting governor, defended his ally's 12-year rule as exemplary in its efficiency and openness.
''Néstor Kirchner is a born administrator who has the character and probity to be president,'' he said in an interview here.
''There is not a single accusation of corruption against him in the courts, unlike Menem, who installed and institutionalized corruption as a policy of state in Argentina.''

But Mr. Kirchner's opponents here also maintain that he has demonstrated authoritarian leanings in what they describe as his unwillingness to tolerate lawful dissent.
Over the past year, they charge, he has urged his followers to use violence to break up peaceful protests, one against a proposed reduction of provincial retirement benefits and others outside the offices and private residences of government officials demanding that they resign.

''Everyone thinks he is the messiah, but it's a clan, a gang, that is in power here,'' said Manuel León, a retired police officer who is a member of a group protesting the pension reform that was recently dislodged from demonstrating in front of provincial government buildings.
''Kirchner has his group of enforcers, and they don't hesitate to beat up even women and children when he incites them to it.''
The lawyer, Dino Zaffrani, accused the company managing the mine of pocketing government subsidies while failing to live up to the terms of its contract and says he has evidence of kickbacks paid to Peronist party fixers loyal to Mr. Kirchner.

''The provincial government has to control these things, and it hasn't,'' said Mr. Zaffrani, who represents the mineworkers and is also a vice president of the provincial bar association.
''Citizens have the right to an opinion and to criticize public servants, but Kirchner is trying to intimidate me so that no one else will dare to criticize him.''
Mr. Zaffrani and other critics also complain that courts and prosecutors routinely refuse to act on complaints of corruption and arbitrary government acts.
Mr. Kirchner has successfully amended the Constitution here to allow himself to pack the provincial Supreme Court with supporters, to run for governor as many times as he wishes and to revise the electoral code to favor his slate of candidates, but his supporters deny any sinister intent.
Mr. Icazuriaga, the Parliament speaker, argues otherwise.
''This is not a fiefdom,'' he said.
''What you see here in Santa Cruz is not authoritarianism, but the effective exercise of power, and that is a very different thing.''

C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, agreed: ''The normal negatives -- rising inflation and rising interest rates -- are nowhere to be seen.
This is the optimum time.
Let it rip.''
There is a downside, however, and that is for Americans traveling abroad, especially in Europe, where the decline in the dollar has made business and vacation trips much more expensive.
Still, those trips are only more expensive than they were four years ago.
Trips to Europe are still cheaper than they were for much of the early and mid-1990's.

The heavier weights on the dollar include the United States' $500 billion current account deficit with the rest of the world, interest rates here that are lower than in many other countries, lingering doubts about the revival of the American economy and worries about low inflation turning into deflation.

In addition, foreign central banks and finance ministers, who know stronger local currencies could impede their own economic recoveries, have yet to protest against the negative effect of a falling dollar.
''It is my belief that the United States government will continue to suggest that a strong dollar is in the country's best interest,'' Mr. Puth said.

''On the other hand,'' he said, ''when we have seen a lack of resistance from the Treasury and other central bank officials to the decline, there is a suggestion that they accept the trend as a reflection of the economic realities of the day.''
The administration's main concern is that the decline does not turn into a free fall that becomes a crisis by sending both inflation and interest rates up quickly.
A free fall can be avoided, said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn., ''as long as foreign investors don't think the administration is going to allow the dollar to collapse.''

How much further will the dollar go?
Most forecasts for the year have already been surpassed, which means a euro at $1.20, or a dollar decline of almost 13 percent in 2003, is not out of the question.
What could stop the decline?
He noted that despite the strong rally in stocks since the end of the main fighting in Iraq -- something that should attract foreign investors -- the dollar's decline has accelerated.
What is needed to stop or slow the decline soon, he said, is protests from Europe about how the rising value of the euro is strangling an economic recovery there.
And, he said, if that protest is backed up with cuts in interest rates by the European Central Bank, the dollar could find a bottom.
Mexico's foreign-currency reserves, an important bulwark against financial crises, now stand at a healthy $53.7 billion.
But the reserves are a mixed blessing for the Bank of Mexico, which is obliged to ''sterilize'' them by selling peso bonds in offsetting amounts.
Because it must pay more interest on the peso bonds than it can earn on its holdings of dollars, kept chiefly in United States Treasury securities, maintaining the reserves costs the bank money.
For the three months ending July 31, the bank is selling $32 million a day for pesos.
''I suspect that there is a lot of commotion at the Bank of Mexico and Hacienda,'' said Yianos Kontopoulos, global currency strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York, referring to the central bank and the country's finance ministry.

''Latin currencies are having a rally that appears excessive to me,'' Mr. Amador said.
There is also an element of speculative fervor in the shift, according to Gray Newman, Latin America economist for Morgan Stanley in New York, who said that the traders who bet on the momentum of changes in the currency had magnified the peso's moves in both directions over the last year.

The central bank, worried that the peso's weakness would translate into inflation as Mexicans would have to pay higher prices in pesos for imports, had tightened monetary policy five times since last September.

The bank does not rely on a benchmark overnight interest rate as many other central banks do; rather, it increases or decreases the amount of cash it makes available to the banking system.
But the money markets have gone the other way as inflation fears have abated.
The yield on 28-day bills, the most widely watched Mexican treasury security, has fallen to 4.9 percent from 9.7 percent on March 13.
Major exporters say that they can weather the loss of competitiveness from the peso's rise so far.
''It would be very negative to leave a market just because the peso is 10 percent more expensive,'' said Enrique Flores, a spokesman for Alfa, a Monterrey-based conglomerate with interests in petrochemicals, steel, food and auto parts.

But other parts of the economy may be more vulnerable, analysts and executives who are critical of the government said.

''All this stupidity of selling oil dollars on the open market is not needed,'' said Eugenio Clariond, chairman and chief executive of Grupo Imsa, another company based in Monterrey, which exports steel and auto batteries.
''Mexico needs to have strong reserves, and the revaluation of the peso particularly does not help the productivity of the most badly affected sector, the agricultural sector.''
Farmers in Mexico complain that they cannot compete against subsidized American farmers, whose corn and beef have been made cheaper in Mexico by the strong peso.
The question now is how long the peso will go on rising.
A midterm election in July could return a divided Congress and continue political gridlock, dashing investors' hopes of significant reforms.

''My view for the end of the year is that we are still likely to see the peso close to 11'' to the dollar, said Mr. Newman of Morgan Stanley.

Well-Cooked Vines
Q.
Are there heat-tolerant vines that can grow in pots?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
A.
No matter which vines you plant, survival starts with large containers.
It is tempting to use small ones to save space, but where the plants will be heat-stressed, thinking big works best.
For annuals, use planters at least 10 inches wide and 18 inches deep.
For perennials, double that.
If there is enough soil to keep the roots cool and allow them room, annual choices include morning glories, in blue, pink, white or bright red, to brighten early hours; moonflowers, for evening perfume; and purple-flowered lablab, or hyacinth bean, which can climb 15 feet in a season.
Scarlet runner beans will also make good screens.
Perennial possibilities include fragrant Dutch honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum); silver lace vine (Polygonum aubertii); and fast-growing clematis species like sweet autumn (Clematis terniflora) and golden (C. tangutica)

Red Menace
Q. I've got red sorrel, a pernicious perennial weed, in my lawn.
Hand digging has not eradicated it.
Is there a nontoxic removal method or must I use an herbicide?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
A.
Red, or sheep, sorrel, Rumex acetosella, is a seriously stubborn weed, even if you do use herbicide.
But although it can grow anywhere, it is so strongly associated with acid soil that it is used as an indicator of overacid conditions.
You will need a soil test to confirm the diagnosis, but if it is correct, adding lime or wood ashes to make the soil more alkaline will probably fix your problem or at least reduce it to a tolerable level.
Fertilizer may help as well.
Sheep sorrel is often a sign of nitrogen deficiency.

Many legal experts defend the industry.
They say these lenders level the playing field between individual plaintiffs and corporate defendants, allowing plaintiffs to outlast their adversaries' delaying tactics and obtain bigger settlements or jury awards.

Susan Lorde Martin, who teaches business law at Hofstra University, said many objections to such loans were unfounded.
Borrowers are seldom exploited, Ms. Martin said, because they are typically represented by lawyers as a consequence of their injury suits.

The loans are for living and medical expenses, which lawyers are generally prohibited from advancing to their clients.
They must be repaid only if the borrower wins or settles the lawsuit, and only if money remains after legal fees and expenses.
Most plaintiffs do not need such loans to finance their lawsuits, because lawyers are allowed to charge contingency fees, being paid only if the case is won.
As an economic matter, such a fee structure is similar to the loans made to Ms. Rancman.

The right-handed Biddle has relieved in 23 games, and the Expos have won 19 of them.
He has saves in five of the team's last six victories, including the first two victories of a three-game sweep of the Giants last week.

Biddle's earned run average, 4.07, isn't impressive.
But if the five earned runs the Braves scored against him in an inning and a third a month ago are discounted, his E.R.A.
would be 2.35.
Biddle has strengthened a pitching staff that is the primary reason the Expos are contending for a postseason spot.
Their 3.47 E.R.A.
is third lowest in the league.

Their payroll, according to the commissioner's office, is either the second lowest, if luxury-tax figures are used, or the fourth lowest, if only this year's salaries are used.
In either case, the Mets' payroll is nearly three times the Expos', clearly demonstrating that the Expos have spent their money far more sagaciously than the Mets have.

The Expos, with Minaya at the helm the past two seasons, have made better trades.
Biddle, for example, has done more for the Expos in seven weeks than Mo Vaughn has done for the Mets in a season and seven weeks.
The Expos are eight games ahead of the Mets in the N.L.
East.
Aside from their ownership and place of doing business, the Expos have a brighter future than the Mets.
While Minaya's future appears bright, the same cannot be said for Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager.

Biddle isn't the only productive relief pitcher Minaya came up with last winter.
He plucked Luis Ayala, a 25-year-old right-hander, from the Arizona organization in the minor league draft, and Ayala has a 4-1 record and a 3.48 E.R.A.
The Expos served notice in their first three games of the season that they would be a threat.

Robinson has done an impressive managing job.
But the 67-year-old Robinson, whose last managerial position was with Baltimore in 1991, learned from his experience and this season has shown more of a willingness to adapt to younger players.
Robinson also knows the players better and has a better feel for what they can do.
The biggest problem the Expos may face is their upcoming monstrosity of a road trip.
Beginning next Monday, they will spend 25 days away from Montreal, flying from Montreal to Florida to Philadelphia to Puerto Rico (their home away from home) to Seattle to Oakland to Pittsburgh.
In that 22-game stretch, the Expos will play, among others, Seattle, Oakland, Anaheim and Philadelphia.
If they survive the trip, they can survive the wild-card race.

Re ''France Says It Was Victim of Lies Fed by White House'' (news article, May 16):
We decry the hatred for America taught in some Saudi schools and the suppression of opinion in the Iraq of Saddam Hussein, yet here at home, we find Bush officials cultivating intolerance for the French and threatening punishment for any country that speaks out against United States policy.
Is this the America that our troops are fighting for?

Today, the ranch was deserted, and the holding pen empty, after 150 head of cattle were removed for quarantine, testing and slaughter on Thursday in southern Alberta.
All have been located and are under quarantine, he added.
Normally, however, the disease takes 5 to 10 years to develop, so the calves would be unlikely to show any signs of infection and would be safe to eat.
The remaining animals in the herd are scheduled to be killed in the next few days, Dr. Lavigne said, so their brain stems can be removed and tested for mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or B.S.E.
Results are expected early next week.

''It's scary because this is heavy cattle country, said Shirley Wells, 56, an owner of a bulk fuel supplier to local farmers.
''It's totally paralyzed our cattle economy.

A farmer who was loading cows in a truck to put them out to pasture, said: ''I think you'll find one cow and that's it.
But it already has hurt us, being blown out of proportion.''
Another farmer, who also asked that his name not be used, said, ''It's one of those isolated things -- it don't mean a thing.''
For now, the source of the infection is a mystery.
Most infections are caused when a healthy animal is fed meat and bone meal, derived from animals that carry the disease.

It is widely accepted that the infection spread in Britain, and to a lesser extent in other European countries, when contaminated meat and bone meal was fed to millions of animals in the late 1980's and 1990's.
Infected cattle are still being identified, though at a much lower rate.

Canada has strict controls to prevent the introduction of B.S.E.
No live animals have been imported from Britain or other affected countries since 1990.

In 1997, ranchers were prohibited from feeding cattle any meat and bone meal made from other cattle.
In any case, Dr. James said, Canada does not have endemic B.S.E., so all of the meat and bone meal produced locally should be free of the disease.
Under a tracking system established in Canada three years ago in response to global concerns about mad cow disease, cattle wear numbered ear tags and have computer files that follow them from birth to the supermarket or rendering plant.
The files include information on what they are fed.

The cow in question, however, was born in 1995, before ear tags and before the ban on feeding meat and bone meal to cattle.
Officials are now working with owners of all three ranches where the cow is known to have lived, to determine what she ate.
Most beef cattle feed on grass and hay rather than meat and bone meal.

It is possible that the animal ate illegally imported meat and bone meal several years ago, but Dr. Lavigne said that import controls were very tight.
''Inspectors would have caught any illegal feed,'' he said.
Calves are sometimes fed supplements that contain blood products from adult cattle.
But infection through that route is unlikely unless other Canadian cattle are infected.

Confusion broke out at the United States border today when American customs officials at Fort Huron, Mich., blocked trucks carrying garbage from Toronto to a Michigan landfill because of concerns about mad cow disease.
In Washington, the Department of Agriculture posted on its Web site a list of 22 products banned from importation from Canada, including live cattle, pet foods containing animal protein, animal vaccines and fats and oils produced from ruminant animals like cattle.
It is Port Huron, not Fort Huron.

The squalid mid-19th-century city portrayed in Martin Scorsese's ''Gangs of New York'' is historically accurate.
More than half a century would pass before New York adopted zoning codes.
Visiting slums was indeed a popular form of entertainment for the rich.
It is difficult, now, to recall that New York was once celebrated as a pioneer in social reform.
Our era has witnessed and even shown pride in the rollback of egalitarian programs.
But the civic tradition embodied by Central Park is only partly reflected in its design.
It is also found in the ideology that created the park, along with public schools, libraries, museums and other social and cultural improvements.
Then, as now, New Yorkers feared that parks would become breeding grounds for indecency and crime.
Forget about Eden.

Reformists took the opposite position.

Central Park is a metaphor for social reform as well as an instrument of it.
In July of that year, the State Legislature approved the project, setting aside more than 750 acres as the site.

For a full account of the park's social and architectural history, I strongly recommend a new illustrated book by Sara Cedar Miller, the park's official historian and photographer.
Entitled ''Central Park, an American Masterpiece'' (Harry N. Abrams), the book offers a sharp summary of the ideas that fed into the park's design.
Healing the Soul
Ms. Miller tells a story of transformation and recreation: the metamorphosis of rocky swampland into a three-dimensional Hudson River School painting and the quasi-mystical thinking behind it.
It is above all a story of the 19th century's preoccupation with health: physical, mental and spiritual.
It's a story of water and its association with purity, cleanliness, the dissolution of cares, the melting away of ego and its attendant fears.
And it's a story of loss, always a great 19th-century theme, the motif of a time when disease constantly threatened to bear loved ones away.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Perhaps the book's most moving chapter recounts the story of Emma Stebbins, sculptor of the ''Angel of the Waters'' fountain at Bethesda Terrace, described by Ms. Miller as Central Park's symbolic heart.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Unveiled three years earlier, the fountain was named after a figure cited in the Gospel according to St. John: a Hebrew angel who endows with healing properties the waters of an ancient Jerusalem well.
Ms. Miller suggests that Stebbins's theme was rooted in the water cures Cushman took as a cancer patient.
She also speculates that Stebbins modeled her angel after her companion's physique.
Ms. Miller proposes that the vision was fulfilled.
I suspect that one day it will be possible to describe with greater precision the sense in which the park promotes feelings of oneness with nature.
My guess is that it involves the operation of a faculty that is not popularly understood to be a sense, like sight or smell.
I mean kinesthesia: the ability to sense the movement of one's limbs and other operable parts of the body.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Architecture is like sports.
Our experience of space may be more closely tied to kinesthetics than it is to vision.
If you want to test this premise, try walking the length of the Mall that stretches south from 72nd Street.
Take it at a city clip.
You can always saunter back.
But if you walk at normal Manhattan street speed, you can better appreciate a heightened sensitivity to your movement.
The relationship of the feet to the buttocks, the spine and the shoulder carriage feels different.
The sensation is not the radical difference you experience when working out at the gym.
But it can feel as dramatic, precisely because the body is not subjected to unusual stress.
There is a correlation between memory and movement.
Certain memories are acquired in movement -- Proust talks about this in the concluding scene of ''In Search of Lost Time'' -- and are aroused again by the kinesthetic sense.
We may feel less threatened by painful memories when out walking, perhaps because the body associates regular steps with the power to move on, to escape the clutches of anger, fear or remorse.

Faces and seasons change.
So do feelings.
Flux and abundance are Central Park's most conspicuous constants.
As the Greeks understood, this is a good formula for dispelling the anxieties provoked by change, the fear of death not least among them.
The celestial blue of the sky and the rays streaming down around the edges of the puffy white and silver aerial upholstery created a hilariously Baroque impression.
We could almost hear the sound of a church organ playing show tunes.
Well, hello, Dolly!
Lilac, yellow, pink and turquoise.

I'm lucky to have that memory of the park's coincidental staging of our pending separation.
In such a setting, there was no fear in acknowledging that our lives were heading along different paths.
Parting seemed as natural as saying goodbye to childhood.
Looking back now, I like to think that my friend and I had briefly shared a single state of grace.
We were just receptive to it, that's all.
Jean Gardner, the environmentalist and Olmsted scholar, observes that Olmsted wanted to create a place where selves could feel safe enough to open up to all of life.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The concept was partly rooted in transcendental ideas, Ms. Gardner says, but with a critical difference.
He wished, rather, that people would become more deeply attuned to the experience of this place, wherever that might be for each visitor.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
For that reason, Olmsted eventually came to oppose the placement of explicitly defined memorials in parks.
The memory should not be coaxed in the direction of specific people and events.
People should freely choose what and how to remember.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Today, we can appreciate the essential modernity of Olmsted's view.
In concept, if not in form, it anticipated Mies van der Rohe's belief that ''less is more.''
The delimitation of memory allowed a greater abundance of memories to flow in.
With the passage of time, of course, memorials become less obtrusive.
Instead, they often become totems of forgetfulness.
Pigeons have inherited objects that were solemnly produced for the sake of posterity.
The anonymity of the formerly famous is wonderfully democratic.

Nicholas D. Kristof (column, May 23) writes that he met Aberash Andreos, 6, at a Catholic-run clinic in Ethiopia.
She was one of many children awaiting milk to rescue them from the famine that threatens millions of people in East Africa.
Those who lead these East African countries are, of course, directly responsible for the disaster.
These wars depleted resources that could have fed the hungry.
Yes, the West does provide some help, but very little reaches children like Aberash.
We hear only of generous missionary-run clinics that operate with limited resources and toil under difficult government pressure.
Americans are generous, but most are misinformed about the bankruptcy of the governments in power.
They also lack reliable avenues to direct their aid to the innocent children who are near death in remote areas in Africa.
GIRMA ABEBE
New York, May 23, 2003
But even if tax cuts and carefully chosen words represent a sensible form of insurance, they seem unlikely to accomplish what everybody agrees is the ultimate goal: the creation of a truly healthy economy, one in which stocks, wages and company payrolls are rising, without an enormous financial bubble as a main cause.

On balance, in fact, the steps being taken to pull the economy back from the precipice may delay the arrival of one able to stand on its own.
''What we're doing now is trying to create a cyclical pop with a massive policy response,'' said James W. Paulsen, one of the few forecasters to predict the 2001 downturn and the chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
''That may well succeed -- I think it will.
But very little of it will solve the problems that got us into this situation.''
Instead, those problems -- consumers who remain financially stretched, a corporate sector that has not yet won back the trust of many investors and a government living well beyond its means -- will weigh on the underlying strengths of the American economy.
Those strengths are not small, as continuing increases in productivity and the even slower growth of Europe and Japan have made clear.

''We have in place probably the best economic infrastructure'' in the world, said Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, the director of the Congressional Budget Office.
''We actually get rid of nonperforming assets.''

None of that is new, however, and the economy's problems have existed long enough to raise the questions of whether slow growth is the new reality, and whether good times like the boom of the late 1990's can exist without the help of a bubble.

In Washington, the problems start with a budget deficit that is expanding more quickly than it was even a week ago.
Then there are ticking fiscal time bombs like the retirement of baby boomers (which will lower the government's income tax revenues, while threatening to bankrupt Social Security) and the alternative minimum tax, a once-obscure provision that is raising the taxes of a new set of households each year.
In future years, the upshot of these trends is likely to be a politically painful choice between higher taxes and lower government benefits.
To hold down the cost of the plan, Congress created tax cuts and tax credits -- for married couples, parents and stockholders -- that expire after a few years, leaving tomorrow's lawmakers to increase the deficit further or to anger voters by allowing the benefits to lapse.

Economists overwhelmingly agree on the wisdom of running deficits during downturns, particularly one that has raised fears of deflation.
''The deflation scenario is so dangerous,'' said J. Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, ''we want to take every step we can to avoid it.''

What makes the slump of the last three years unusual is that spending by consumers stayed strong, which means they will be less likely to supplant the government as the main engine of growth once taxes increase or federal spending falls in future years.
Consumers have typically emerged from past recessions with a pent-up desire for houses, cars and other big-ticket items they avoided buying during tough times.
This time, an aggressive series of interest rate reductions by the Fed has helped make many of those items affordable even as wage gains have all but stopped, after inflation is taken into account.

In trumpeting the Fed's vigilance against deflation in recent weeks, Mr. Greenspan has ensured continued low interest rates.
Bond traders now believe that short-term rates, which the Fed controls, will remain low for months, and they have reacted by lowering long-term rates.
Thus, last week, mortgage rates plunged to record lows, making it more likely that the refinancing boom will continue.
''This is obviously not going to go on forever,'' said Jan Hatzius, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs.
The recent growth of consumer spending, he added, ''is sustainable as long as households are able to take more and more equity from their homes.''

THE one recent attempt at resuscitation that economists say is likely to bring future benefits is the dollar's decline, which has accelerated since Mr.
By contrast, the Clinton administration occasionally bought dollars in the currency market to bolster their value, hold down the price of imports and keep inflation low when the economy was growing rapidly.
Now, however, a little inflation does not look so bad.
Even before the dollar's recent fall, the corporate sector was the only big part of the economy that has used the slowdown to bring its debts better into line with its assets.
Pointing to benefits from the dollar's fall, many economists say they expect corporate executives will soon end their cost-cutting ways of the last three years and decide that they can profitably use new factories and new technology.

That is a reason to think the economy will improve before the year ends, as almost every forecaster is predicting.
By itself, however, it might not be enough to restore the economy to full health.
But in the culture of the times, trying to Americanize foreigners was considered beneficial to recipients and society.''

In an interview conducted by e-mail, Dr. David Rosner, director of the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia, added that ''among health and social welfare professionals no one really argued until the 1930's that removing kids was horrifying.''
Legislative battles in the states have also become intense as doctors protest what they call the effects of costly malpractice insurance and lawsuits.
Hospitals in some states have closed their obstetrics departments because the risk of lawsuits and the price of liability insurance are both too high, an issue that resonates with the public.
Measures drafted to reduce doctors' liability often contain language that will also limit other kinds of liability.

''This is a year where we had seen considerable opportunity at the state level, and the major reason is the health care issue has been driving the agenda,'' said Sherman Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform Association.
Just last week, doctors held a poorly attended rally in Manhattan in favor of changing state laws on tort litigation -- civil lawsuits arising from claims of injury, including injury as a result of malpractice.
Doctors and insurers blame jury verdicts for the high premiums.
''That's where you see these losses,'' said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute in New York.
The average medical malpractice award rose to $3.9 million in 2001, from $3.41 million in 2000 and $3.29 million in 1999, according to the institute.

''The stock market is low and interest rates are low, and insurance companies have to make their profits,'' said Mark Phenicie, legislative counsel for the Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association.

Trial lawyers in several states have organized fierce counterattacks against coalitions of insurance companies, doctors and other businesses in a test of lobbying and marketing power.
In New York, the lawyers have begun an advertising campaign depicting the victims of medical malpractice and citing cases where lawsuits resulted in safer products.
In Pennsylvania, trial lawyers have paid for radio ads and are sending letters to lawmakers.
In Florida they are combining both strategies with other efforts to reach voters and lawmakers.
The push for legislation in the states does not mean that Washington has been abandoned.
The House of Representatives approved a bill in March that would cap an award for pain and suffering at $250,000.
However, Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of Southern California who has followed the battles over tort litigation, said that most tort law is state law.
''There are no federal laws with regard to when you can hold manufacturers or doctors or lawyers or anyone liable,'' Mr. Chemerinsky said.
''All of that is covered by state law, and every state can have its own rules.
So product liability law, for example, is the product of 50 different states' product liability laws.''

Fear of lawsuits -- let alone actual suits -- takes time and money away from running the business, he added.
Large companies also want changes to tort laws, said Michael Baroody, executive vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
''It's as nearly a universal a proposition as there is in the business community that the current tort system is massively dysfunctional.''

''We have had individual case studies with pictures and a story about Pennsylvania victims mailed to every legislator,'' he said.
According to the American Tort Reform Association, which is tracking bills across the country, legislation that would limit defendants' liability in some way is under consideration in several states, including Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Texas.
Some states, like Iowa, may take up legislation again in special sessions, and in other states plans are under way to reintroduce such measures in the fall.

Because state laws differ, proposed changes are not the same in every state.
In California, for example, defense lawyers for years have attacked a law that allows individuals to file suits on behalf of the public; not many states have such a broad provision.

But there are common elements in the legislative proposals.
The first target is often joint and several liability, which may result in one defendant who is only partly responsible for an injury bearing the full burden of a judgment.
The principle was intended to ensure that victims were fully compensated, but defendants argue it is unfair.
Ohio and Oklahoma have already modified their joint and several liability rules.
Another target is the size of jury awards.
Lawmakers in Texas, for example, will consider a bill limiting noneconomic damages -- for pain and suffering, for example -- in medical malpractice suits to a total of $750,000, said Ralph Wayne, president of the Texas Civil Justice League.

''We're on the cusp of passing this,'' Mr. Wayne said.
Sizable verdicts are also a target because to appeal a decision, companies facing multimillion-dollar penalties often must post a bond equal to the full penalty.
In some cases, lawyers have argued, putting up the full amount of the damage award would exceed the value of a company.
In New York, doctors are seeking most of these restrictions and some other specialized measures.
They want to receive more information about expert witnesses used by plaintiffs, as well as a cap on damages for pain and suffering, said Elizabeth Dears Kent, counsel to the division of governmental affairs of the Medical Society of New York.
Neither advocates of change nor the trial lawyers would discuss how much money they are spending this year.
Both sides -- on the one hand, corporations and doctors, and on the other, plaintiffs' lawyers who have won large settlements from the tobacco industry and elsewhere -- have access to deep pockets.

Politicians Propose Limits On Rising Credit Card Rates
A provision now built into most credit card agreements allows issuers to reset a cardholder's interest rate based on the size and status of the person's other debts.
And issuers check their customers' data regularly, not only when they review applications or notice missed payments.
Concerned that consumers have not been sufficiently informed about the practice and that the sharp jumps in rates may be an overreaction, some state and federal legislators are proposing limits.

Bush Signs Tax Cut Bill Into Law
President Bush signed the third tax cut in three years into law, dismissing criticism of the cost, fairness and effectiveness and casting the measure as ''essential action to strengthen the American economy.''

There is more risk there, you could argue.
And dividends can be cut.
But prices and dividends can also rise.
A stock buyer can expect to beat Treasuries over the next five years if shares only stay level.

''The willingness to buy Treasuries when stocks yield a comparable after-tax return speaks to serious fears that the U.S. faces a Japan-like future,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig.
He views those worries as overdone.
Bidding the yield on Treasuries so low also reflects the fact that many investors -- who only three years ago loved stocks at prices far higher than current ones -- now seek safety.
Factor in a little inflation, or even a half-decent economy, and current rates could rise enough to produce losses for any Treasury investor not prepared to wait for maturity.
The ''risk-free return'' could turn out to be a ''return-free risk,'' as James Grant put it in the current edition of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.

Back in the 1940's and early 1950's, it was accepted wisdom that the dividend yield on stocks should be higher than the interest yield on bonds -- even without any tax breaks -- to compensate investors for the risks of capital losses.
If you think that the United States economy is in terminal decline, then stocks are clearly overpriced and perhaps Treasuries look good even at these low yields.

But the more likely alternative is that economic growth will gradually pick up.
The latest batch of economic statistics have been mildly positive.
And it does seem odd to worry about deflation even as the Bush administration heads for huge budget deficits.
Technology stocks, many of which have rebounded sharply since the market bottom in October, probably are in for more disappointments as many businesses face oversupply problems that will hold down margins for years.
But an investor has to be pretty pessimistic to think the overall market won't beat the after-tax return of 1.47 percent for five years that is now being so ungenerously offered by the Treasury.
For the moment, however, an increase in long-term rates seems far away.
As a result, consumers may be able to pay less interest on mortgages and credit cards, and businesses may find it cheaper to invest in new construction or equipment.
A further decrease in long-term rates, which the Fed could achieve by buying Treasury bonds with longer maturities, could give a bigger jolt to the economy and put an end to worries about deflation.

Anticipating such a move by the Fed, some investors have been buying long-term bonds, said Robert E. Mellman, a senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan Chase.
They may be playing a precarious game of chicken, however.
If the Fed's policy succeeds in generating growth and inflation, it will render the returns on the bonds less valuable.
''If the Fed's really trying to push inflation up, maybe you don't want to bet against them,'' Mr. Mellman said.
''But that's not the way the market's taking it.''
The window of opportunity for investors may be brief, but that has not stopped them from pouring money into longer-term securities.
For some, that decision may have been overdue.

In the last several months, many institutional investors have been hoarding cash thanks to uncertainty about the economy and the Fed's plan of action, said Joseph W. Jasper, the director of fixed-income strategy at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
But now, with the Fed's apparent commitment to keeping short-term rates low, long-term bonds may be too tempting to pass up.

''They just can't stay short anymore,'' Mr. Jasper said.

In addition, investors tastes' may still be shifting from stocks to bonds.
''People have, first of all, kind of recalibrated their expectation about risk,'' said John A. Penicook Jr., managing director and global head of fixed income for UBS Global Asset Management.
''As they've moved away from equities, all these other things by definition have become relatively more attractive.''
As well as providing a haven relative to stocks, Treasury bonds may be acting as a safety net relative to the rest of the world.

''The problem is if you're an investor, you just don't know where to put your money other than the U.S.,'' said Mr. Mellman at J. P. Morgan.
''No one can find good places to invest.''
Another possible explanation for falling long-term rates is an increase in the amount of money available for investment -- in other words, an increase in saving.
Indeed, Mr. Penicook noted, recent statistics have shown an upturn in saving by American households.
But it seems more likely that the two shifts -- from short- to long-term securities and from stocks to bonds -- are having more effect on the markets.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
For one thing, Mr. Mellman said, an incremental change in saving by Americans could mean relatively little in the fast-moving global capital market.
Moreover, their frugality may just be canceling the federal government's exploding deficits.
''If you looked at saving rates for the overall U.S.,'' he said, ''I don't think there can be an argument that they're going up.''

Mr. Jasper at U.S. Bancorp suggested that a snowballing effect might also be helping to drive down interest rates on medium- to long-term bonds.
As yields on Treasury securities fall, he said, mortgage rates tend to fall as well.
Lower rates lead to refinancing, which often involves replacing partly paid 30-year loans with 15-year loans.
When refinancing becomes more popular, Mr. Jasper said, money managers who hold bundles of mortgages can see the maturities of their portfolios becoming shorter.
Many 30-year mortgages are paid off within 10 years or less, and mortgages with 15-year terms typically last even less time before repayment.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The managers often want to offset this change with longer-duration securities, Mr. Jasper explained.
So they buy 10-year Treasury notes, which the government is unlikely to pay off before a decade is up, driving down yields on those notes even further.
''Whenever you get a rally in the 10-year, mortgage hedging activity will exaggerate that,'' Mr. Jasper concluded.
Setting off another refinancing boom, which could result in tens of billions of dollars in economic activity, may have been an explicit goal of the Fed.
In the past, Mr. Greenspan has often cited the housing market as a main source of strength in the economy.
He has also dismissed the notion of a bubble in the housing market, saying that such phenomena are more likely to occur in isolated localities rather than on a national level.

If the economy manages to avoid more shocks, like the war in Iraq and the torrent of corporate scandals, the underlying strength that Mr. Greenspan cites like a mantra might finally show through.
Then those low long-term rates might disappear.
''The most likely strategy of the Fed is to commit to a policy of low short-term rates until there are signs of the economy strengthening and inflation picking up,'' Professor Gertler said.
''Once there's evidence that's the economy's going to pick up, you'll likely see that long-term rates are going to rise.''
''Ultimately, the recovery and the effect of the debt will put upward pressure on long-term rates.''

The low rates might stick around longer, though, if prices rise slowly even after the economy improves its performance.
''It's a perception that inflation's going to stay very low for a long time, and that's going to keep the Fed on hold for a long time,'' Mr. Mellman said.
''It's sort of like faster growth with pretty low inflation.''
''I see two tendencies on the Web,'' said Stephanie Coontz, co-chairwoman of the Council on Contemporary Families in Manhattan, which represents more than 100 researchers and other professionals who work with families.
''One tendency is to offer comforting solutions to issues that are too complex to be easily packaged, like how to have a good child-parent relationship.
But the other tendency is to pathologize normal behaviors so that parents will worry, like assuming that a teenager who smokes marijuana is an addict.''

Still, a vast majority of parents continue to use the Internet, in part because of its convenience, some experts say.
A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, released last fall, found that 70 percent of parents with children at home go online for information, compared with 53 percent of adults who do not have a minor child living at home.
''There is a lot of junk out there for parents on the Internet, and even when it isn't junk, it's often either not trustworthy or it's inconsistent with current child development findings,'' he said.

By pushing for incremental progress, the petitioners exemplify the ''change from within'' approach that many young intellectuals see as China's most promising, and perhaps only, path to political change.

China has no firm procedure for deciding whether government rules or actions are constitutional.

When animals eat the remains of their own species or other species, infectious prions sometimes pass among them.

Prions can incubate for very long periods of time before they result in full-blown disease, with each animal or person experiencing the effects differently.
But questions about which animal can infect which other animal in the animal world, including humans, continue to perplex researchers worldwide.

Answers matter because regulations in United States intended to keep mad cow disease out of the country and to control related prion disorders like chronic wasting disease in deer and elk are based on fully understanding the biology of species barriers.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Ranchers, for example, are not allowed to feed their cows the rendered remains of other cows and closely related species.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But such remains can be fed to more distant species like pigs, chicken and fish.
Wastes from those animals, once rendered, can be fed back to cows.
In the wake of mad cow disease, this practice of cross-species feeding is banned in Britain and many European countries.
But because mad cow disease had not shown up in North America until last week, when a cow in Alberta, Canada, was found to have been infected, regulators here say that cross contamination is an unlikely threat.

For the same reason, relatively few American cattle, compared with those in Europe, are tested for the disease; if it is rare or nonexistent, it will not have opportunities to cross species barriers.

Research on species barriers and prion diseases is fraught with enigmas, dead-ends, contradictions and confusion.
Species barriers are very hard to predict, said Dr. Patrick Bosque, a neurologist at Denver Health Hospital and the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center who studies the problem.
Often there is no plausible explanation for why an infectious agent does or doesn't move from one species to another.

''We don't understand what's happening,'' said Dr. Stanley Prusiner, a neurology professor at the University of California at San Francisco who won a Nobel Prize for elucidating prions' disease-causing powers.
''Anyone who believes we understand what's happening is mistaken.''
This much is known.
Cells have a huge machinery for folding up proteins, molecules that carry out most of the body's work.
Each protein can follow many possible folding pathways to assume its final shape and function.
Mistakes are common, but normally misfolded proteins are routinely chopped up and recycled or dumped.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
When the normal prion protein misfolds, it resists recycling and forms a hardy gunk.
Some aspect of this process produces lethal spongelike holes in brain cells.
When an animal is exposed to infected brain tissue, its own prions can be hijacked and forced to produce more of this infectious gunk.
Misfolded prions occur in strains.
Each has slightly different biological properties, including shape, incubation time, infectious dose, target tissue and clinical signs of disease.
Strains appear to evolve as species trade prions.

But after six years the cows show no signs of illness, Dr. Williams said, and another group of cows that were fed rations infected with bits of brain tissue from infected deer also remain healthy.
The experiment is to last 10 years.
To speed things up, a second approach involves injecting tainted brain material directly into the brains of various species.

Sheep injected with mad cow disease develop brain lesions that look just like scrapie.
The cow disease can also be passed into pigs and cats, and to ungulates via injection.
Cows receiving infected deer tissue develop abnormal prions but their brains look healthy.
Sheep that get deer tissue get a disease that looks again like scrapie.

Raccoons develop prion disease when exposed to mink or sheep prions but not deer prions.
And when elk are injected with sheep scrapie, they develop a disease that looks identical to chronic wasting disease in elk.
Because this kind of injection process would not occur in the wild, it is not clear what its relevance might be.
Experts say that resistance to injected prions may be related to the fact that some animals rapidly clear misfolded prions, dumping them before they become toxic.

Because it may take many years for prion diseases to develop, some species may not live long enough to develop clinical symptoms.

A third approach, which is especially good for studying strain evolution, involves transgenic mice.
Rodents that carry human, cow, sheep or deer prions instead of the mouse variety are injected with alien prions to see what happens.
Their brains are injected back into other animals to see what happens.
The results are often confusing, Dr. Bosque said.
Mice with human prion genes get chronic wasting disease but not mad cow disease, while humans get mad cow disease but not chronic wasting disease, so far.

Some humanized mice infected with bovine disease go on to develop new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease while others get a type that looks like sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the disease of older people that is not related to cows.

Bryan was right -- adopting a more flexible monetary policy would have solved the debtor problem, though it may also have had other, pernicious effects.
Indexing the loans to the price level would have been another way to address this issue.

Compare this supply-side deflation with the demand-side deflation of the 1930's.
How do these two periods of deflation compare with today's ''deflationary threat''?
Neither offers an exact analogy.
Today we have some of the excess supply pressures of the 1890's along with the weak demand pressures of the 1930's, albeit in a far milder form.

The big difference today is that the Fed is pursuing active monetary growth and has made it clear that it will be aggressive in dealing with any further economic deterioration.

The excess supply we see today comes from two related forces: the investment binge of the late 1990's and the strong productivity growth in recent years.

Because of these two factors, businesses have had little inclination to make new investments, leading to slack demand and downward pressure on prices.
The Fed has responded appropriately by loosening monetary policy to stimulate aggregate demand.
Consumers have responded to low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages and continuing to buy, keeping aggregate demand stronger than it would have been under a tighter monetary policy.
Prices aren't increasing, but they aren't falling, either.

The worry is that the loose monetary policy won't be effective indefinitely.
If economic activity stays slow, and unemployment rises, consumers will become more cautious, making them more reluctant to spend.
As John Maynard Keynes put it, ''You can't push on a string,'' meaning you can give people more dollars, but you can't make them spend them.
To pursue the medical analogy introduced earlier: the symptom is deflation (or, at least, soft prices), the diagnosis is weak aggregate investment demand, and the recommended treatment is money supply growth.
But the critical question is, as always, will the patient recover?

I'm cautiously optimistic.
There are signs that business spending is coming back to life, and the recent drop in the dollar will make America's exports much cheaper abroad, thereby increasing employment and investment in export-sensitive industries.
But relying on a weak dollar to solve our economic problems is tricky.
First, it takes a long time to show results, and second, our trading partners don't like it.
Trade relations between the United States and Europe are at the worst point in years, and we could easily see some sort of retaliation.

If monetary policy and exchange-rate jawboning don't do the trick, the next medication to try is fiscal policy.
Given the weak investment demand and the increasing unemployment, the most effective policies would be temporary investment credits coupled with tax cuts for low-income workers and direct aid to state governments.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The first policy directly stimulates aggregate demand, which is the real source of the problem; the second helps counterbalance the potential drop in spending because of unemployment; and the third helps mitigate likely tax increases at the state level.
Unfortunately, that's not what Congress did.
Instead we have a cut in taxes for high-income households, some rather modest investment incentives and aid to the states, and the truly bizarre temporary cut in the dividend tax rate.
This is like going to the doctor to complain about a headache and being told to soak your feet in hot water.
Soaking your feet might not hurt you -- but it sure won't do anything for your headache.
DOLLAR FALLS.
The dollar fell as a surge in jobless claims heightened speculation that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates.
''There must be a route map so that it's perfectly feasible to have a referendum before the election,'' said Graham Bishop, a pro-euro economic consultant, reflecting a sense in the pro-euro camp that some kind of compromise will be found to keep alive the campaign for the euro.

''The big concern is giving up control of interest rates,'' said James Frayne, an anti-euro campaigner.
Britons traditionally try to buy their houses, and interest rates on mortgages are important to voters.
A central argument invoked against the euro is that Britain would no longer be able to control the levers of its economy if interest rates were decreed by the European Central Bank.

''The pound is in danger of going into free fall,'' he said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In the past, for instance, British exports suffered because the pound was too strong against the euro, making British goods expensive for Continental Europeans to buy.
Now that the pound has fallen, exporters are happier.
But British vacationers are not, because their trips to Continental Europe are more expensive.
Apart from Britain, the only European Union members outside the euro zone are Denmark and Sweden.
The pound's future is intimately entwined with an emotional nationalistic debate over sovereignty and suspicion of Europe that suffuses the anti-euro campaign.
But there are clear economic differences as well.
While Britain's economy is still believed likely to grow, the German economy at the heart of the euro zone is stagnating.
British unemployment is at record lows while it is high in many of the leading euro-zone economies.

A further issue to be assessed by Mr. Brown on Monday is whether foreign investment in Britain by big international companies seeking a European base, like the automakers Nissan and Toyota, will be withdrawn if Britain gives no indication that it plans to join the euro.

The times, they are a-changing.
Last week, Queen Elizabeth II, the duke's favorite niece, made news by dining in the company of Camilla Parker Bowles, her son Prince Charles's companion, at Clarence House, his newly decorated London residence.
Mrs. Parker Bowles was just one of several guests at that gathering of senior members of the royal family, in honor of the queen's 50th year as monarch, but her presence has touched off animated speculation that the heir to the throne may well walk down the aisle with his longtime mistress without having to relinquish his crown.

Especially astonishing to read are frantic avowals of undying love, rendered in a creepy combination of saccharine baby talk and pathological desperation.
''I love you love you so so madly & desparately.
I worship & adore you my sweetheart & cant bear being away from you,'' the 26-year-old prince frantically scribbled one morning from St. James's Palace.
He calls Dudley Ward three, four, five times a night and is bereft when the line is busy or she has gone to the theater with a friend.
She is Toi, he is Moi.
She is ''Sweetheart & Tormentor'' or ''my little Fredie,'' while he signs himself her ''little slave'' and her ''little parpee'' (puppy).
And in a startling foreshadowing of his great-nephew Prince Charles's much-publicized wish to live inside Mrs. Parker Bowles's trousers, the future Edward VIII reports that he loves it when his mistress wears his jodhpurs.

For the family of Freda Dudley Ward, an Anglo-American textile heiress who was married to a Liberal politician, William Dudley Ward, and the mother of two daughters, the prince's tone and words are a bit much to stomach.
''Everybody who might have been offended or upset by them, namely my mother and my aunt,'' is dead, Mrs. Davis said.
''The relationship between my grandmother and the Prince of Wales is part of history.
Why not sell them?''

So what about the other side of the story, Freda Dudley Ward's letters to the prince?
Mrs. Davis suspects that they remain with the British royal family, though she admits they may not have survived the ascent of Wallis Simpson.
But judging by the future king's occasionally chastened, apologetic responses, Dudley Ward's letters seem likely to have been filled with sensible admonitions to do his duty, to stop complaining, and to recognize all he might accomplish as a forward-thinking monarch.
And unlike the prince's other important mistresses, Gloria Vanderbilt's aunt Thelma Furness and the brusque Simpson, Dudley Ward seems to have been genuinely well liked, even admired, by other members of his family.
''I don't think she went on loving him for all that long, not as a lover.

Freddie Mac has also repeatedly said that its business is strong and that its internal investigation is examining whether it recognized profits in the right time period, not whether it inflated profits.

So far, investors seem to agree.
While Freddie Mac's stock is down more than 16 percent since Friday, its bonds have lost only a faction of their value.
But the new investigations add to the pressure on Freddie Mac to disclose more information quickly about its accounting issues and the notes that Mr. Glenn is said to have altered.
Freddie Mac and its larger cousin, Fannie Mae, are pivotal players in both the housing and bond markets.
Freddie Mac alone holds $600 billion in mortgages.
So serious problems at Freddie Mac could reverberate throughout the economy, analysts say.

Switzerland's economy, now in recession, will not improve until investor confidence returns, the chairman of the Swiss central bank, Jean-Pierre Roth, said today.
Mr. Roth abandoned his March forecast that the economy could grow this year, joining private economists in predicting that the Swiss economy will stagnate as unemployment, currently at 3.9 percent, continues to rise and demand in the important euro-zone markets remains low.
Switzerland exports more than 60 percent of its goods to the 15 nations of the European Union.
The central bank, the Swiss National Bank, has cut interest rates over the last two years to near zero.
''We're reaching the limits of monetary policy,'' Mr. Roth said at a news conference after the rate decision.
''We have tried with monetary policy to create the best possible framework, but we can't steer the situation.''
''What's missing is still trust'' among investors, he said.
Despite the rate cuts, the Swiss franc has until recent months been strong, hurting Swiss exporters.
If the franc resumes its climb against the dollar and the euro, Mr. Roth said today that the central bank would not hesitate to intervene in world currency markets or buy bonds.

Investment problems may have already led some insurers to raise premiums.
Several studies by Americans for Insurance Reform, a coalition of consumer groups, have concluded that poor investment performance -- not greater claims and settlements -- are the major reason for skyrocketing malpractice premiums.
Martin Weiss, chairman of Weiss Ratings, which rates the financial strength of insurers, also sees rising premiums as an effect of poor investments.
''In the property and casualty business, premiums have been rising sharply,'' he said.
''One of the big factors has been the decline in investment income, which includes portfolio losses.''
Under current accounting guidelines, companies have wide latitude to determine when an investment loss is other than temporary.
But once a company decides that an investment it holds is not likely to recover, it must deduct the loss from earnings.

And the problem is not confined to these large companies.
''Our opinion is that the life insurance companies in general have been slow in recognizing bond losses as 'other than temporary' and flowing them through their income statements,'' said Mr. Riegel at Moody's.
The danger for insurers, and ultimately for consumers, is a kind of avalanche effect.
Poor investment performance hurts earnings and erodes the capital base upon which insurer ratings depend.
If an insurer is downgraded by a credit agency, it may then need to conserve capital by cutting back planned purchases of its own stock or even to raise more capital, increasing its own borrowing costs.
An insurer may then be tempted to raise premiums.

With life insurers especially exposed to credit-related bond problems, Moody's holds a negative outlook on that industry.
For the holders of troubled bonds, the issue is timing.
Though accounting rules require them to reduce the value of investments once losses are deemed to be other than temporary, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, whose guidance could clarify the issue, has never given precise direction on how to make that judgment.

As a result, companies use varying criteria to decide when a loss is unlikely to be reversed.
''Some companies may look at bonds that are under water for a year or more,'' said Julie Burke, a managing director with Fitch Ratings.
''Others may look at six months.''
At Hillenbrand Industries, which has taken write-downs for the holdings of its Forethought Life Insurance subsidiary, Mark Lanning, vice president and treasurer, said a security that remains down 20 percent for six months would warrant review.
Even then, Hillenbrand's investment oversight committee could conclude the decline was reversible and avoid a charge.
''We don't have a fine white line in the sand.
This is definitely an area where accounting is an art, not a science,'' he said.

FASB has been unable to draw that fine white line, despite several meetings on the issue this year.
''It's a very fundamental issue, and there's not a lot of definitive guidance out there,'' said Larry Smith, chairman of FASB's task force on emerging issues, which is studying the problem.
Where accounting guidelines are ambiguous, opportunities abound for masking bad news.
Some companies try to offset investment write-downs with gains on appreciated bond holdings.
''They may sell some securities to generate gains at the same time they're taking impairment charges,'' noted Dwayne D. Hallman, senior vice president for finance at Horace Mann Educators, an insurer in Springfield, Ill.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Some ratings analysts argue that this practice is misleading.
''If a company chooses to take interest-related gains to offset credit losses, this is window dressing,'' said Ms. Burke at Fitch Ratings.
For one thing, interest rates can reverse course, obliterating gains.
And to turn a paper gain into an earnings gain, the bondholder would have to sell the appreciated holding.
But since bond prices are higher because rates are lower, the buyer would then have to reinvest the proceeds at a lower rate.
Still, it is a view echoed by many of the scientists, technologists, doctors, entrepreneurs and drug company executives who assembled here to assess and perhaps accelerate the melding of technology and biology.

Stephen M. Case, the founder of America Online, who spoke at the conference, remarked: ''I have the same instinct I had when I got involved with the Internet world 25 years ago, which is that something is bubbling.

Mr. Case, who described his efforts to spur the search for brain cancer treatments after the death of his brother Daniel from the disease last year, attributes some of the new buzz over biotechnology to the aging of his technology industry peers.
As people like Mr. Case, 44, who recently stepped down as chairman of AOL Time Warner; Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates; Oracle's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison; and other Silicon Valley leaders encounter health problems in the lives of people they know, it seems natural for them to look to technology to address a growing sense of mortality.

Similarly, Astro Teller, chief executive of BodyMedia, said that Roche Diagnostics this summer would begin selling his company's armband, a small computer with a processor and sensor, for $300 to $400 as a weight-management tool.
BodyMedia says the device can measure how many calories its wearer burns.
Users enter a list of what they eat each day into the accompanying computer program, and the computer displays the gain or loss in calories.
The logic behind the device is the same as that underpinning many of the current and future technology tools invoked at Tedmed: a much larger chunk of the $1.4 trillion that Americans spend annually on health care can be attributed to behavior than to genetics.
Most people know, for instance, that they should eat better or exercise or not smoke, but they don't.
Technology can help, the argument goes, by allowing more precise self-monitoring or enabling patients to transmit the information to health care professionals.
People are more likely to change their behavior, this idea has it, when they know someone is watching them.

Still, while many casualties of the Internet boom offered cures for nonexistent problems, the state of the health care system in the United States seems to cry out for change.
With health maintenance organizations raising rates, more companies are transferring more and more responsibility for health care costs to their employees, who sometimes seek new solutions.
''People are fed up with health care,'' said Stephen Barrie, founder of the Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory in Asheville, N.C., which specializes in genetic testing.
''And the Internet has whetted their appetite to get real answers to their questions.''
People must be referred to the laboratory through a doctor to receive these tests, which cost $200 to $300 and are based on technology developed during the sequencing of the human genome.
Small companies are not the only ones who see financial opportunity in all this.
Pharmaceutical companies regard personalized drug treatment as a potential windfall, and technology companies see new customers in the need to process vast amounts of data to find the needed new drugs.

Still, some barriers to achieving the kind of interdisciplinary harmony that could significantly improve the health and longevity of Americans were apparent at the conference.

The power of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae on Capitol Hill has stemmed partly from their importance to homeowners and the housing industry.
Because they own or guarantee more than a third of the home mortgages in America, any threat to their operations could raise the cost of mortgages and hurt well-organized constituencies in every Congressional district.

Their power also stems from their political operations.
The profits from Wall Street are used to recruit politicians from both parties as executives and to hire lobbyists -- 19 lobbying firms last year for Freddie Mac; 23 for Fannie Mae, according to PolitcalMoneyLine.
Freddie Mac's chief internal lobbyist, Mitchell Delk, is known for having fund-raisers for members of Congress, though those are ''personal activities'' separate from the company, said Douglas Robinson, spokesman for Freddie Mac.
''The lobbying ability of Fannie and Freddie is second to none in Washington,'' said Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the companies.
''They have not only unlimited financial resources but good personnel who maintain good relations with many members of Congress.
When their interests are threatened, the response is almost armylike.
They're tactical, and they're everywhere.''
Besides helping the young couples in their advertisements pay for homes, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have also helped pay for the purchase, renovation and upkeep of the headquarters for the Democratic and Republican Parties in Washington.
Since 1999, PoliticalMoneyLine says, Fannie Mae has contributed over $2.5 million to house the parties' national and campaign committees, while Freddie Mac has contributed more than $6 million.

Fannie Mae has a tradition of recruiting government veterans with nongovernment salaries.

Officials at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have been frank about the need to manage what they call ''politicial risk'' just as much as they manage the financial risks of their portfolios.
Chuck Greener, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee who is a senior vice president at Fannie Mae, said: ''We're passionate about our mission and the public role it fulfills.
Consequently, we feel it's important to communicate with Congress and policy makers.''

The public mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is to promote homeownership, especially among lower-income Americans.
Although they do not directly write mortgages, they buy them from the primary lenders, sell them to other investors and guarantee them against default.

Supporting that mission poses no direct strain on the federal budget, another reason the companies are so popular on Capitol Hill.
The support takes the form of indirect subsidies worth more than $10 billion a year, according to a 2001 study by the Congressional Budget Office.
Besides exemptions of $1 billion worth of local taxes and securities fees, the budget office found, the companies save more than $9 billion a year thanks to an ''implicit subsidy'': the ability to borrow money cheaply because of the widespread assumption that the federal government would cover any losses, even though it is not legally obligated to do so.
Critics on both the right and left have called it corporate welfare.
''These are the most successful corporate hermaphrodites in world history,'' said Mr. Nader, the consumer advocate and former presidential candidate.
''While there is a widespread need for affordable housing in America, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae report massive profits, provide their top executives with huge compensation packages and laugh all the way to the bank with government guarantees.
It's a paradigm of how to influence Washington.''

The companies dispute the estimates of their subsidies and say that their advantages over rivals stem chiefly from better management.
Freddie Mac cites a study it commissioned from James E. Pearce, a former Federal Reserve Bank economist, and James C. Miller III, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, which concludes that any subsidies to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are greatly exceeded by the benefits that consumers receive in the form of lower interest rates on mortgages.

The companies have many defenders.
''America has the world's highest rate of homeownership because we're the only country that has a Fannie or Freddie,'' said Angelo R. Mozilo, the chairman of Countrywide Financial, a large mortgage lender.
''Nobody wins if they're damaged or impeded.
Housing is the only thing driving the economy right now.''
But there are also many critics, especially among their rivals.
''Fannie and Freddie always say not to do anything to them because you'll upset the housing market and the economy,'' said Mike House, the executive director of FM Policy Focus, a coalition of companies in the mortgage and housing industries.
''But the events of the past week show that not properly regulating them can cause more problems.
Nobody knows the long-term implications of this.''
The accounting questions could well turn out to be a short-lived problem, but critics fear the possibility that Freddie Mac is hiding some long-term weakness in its portfolio.
Because the two companies have grown so huge, a failure by either could be cataclysmic for the economy and leave the federal government with the prospect of a bailout.
''We need to get a much stronger regulatory structure over Fannie and Freddie, and the reform efforts seem more likely than ever to succeed now,'' said Mr. Baker, who will hold House hearings into the companies.
He said that Congress might create a new federal regulator to oversee the companies and that lawmakers might also start requiring the companies to follow the registration and disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
That does not satisfy Peter J. Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute, editor of ''Serving Two Masters Yet Out of Control: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac'' (AEI Press).
''Congress,'' he said, ''should be talking about privatization -- removing their links to the government -- and splitting them up so that the errors of one or more managements will not threaten the country's economic health.''

For now, though, the most radical change that appears possible would be stricter oversight.
''We've always said we favor a strong and well-funded regulator,'' said Mr. Greener of Fannie Mae.
''But we do not believe Congress will take any action that in any way changes our status or impairs our mission.''
German business confidence kept rising in June, according to a survey of analysts and institutional investors released by the ZWE Center for European Economic Research.
The institute's index that measures expectations for economic growth rose 2.6 points, to 21.3 points, the sixth consecutive monthly rise, which exceeded by far most forecasts by economists.

Some officials said that the transition from Mr. Duisenberg to Mr. Trichet could now come as early as September.
It would reinforce a shift already under way in the bank's approach to setting monetary policy and interest rates, away from a narrow focus on money supplies and toward a broader consideration of general economic conditions.

Last July, a magistrate rejected a recommendation by the public prosecutor's office that the case be dropped against all Crédit Lyonnais defendants, including Mr. Trichet; Jacques de Larosiére, who was governor of the Bank of France in the early 1990's; Crédit Lyonnais's chairman from those days, Jean-Yves Haberer; and Jean-Pascal Beaufret, the representative of the French treasury on the board of Crédit Lyonnais and now the chief financial officer of the French electronics company Alcatel.

Mr. Beaufret, Mr. De Larosiére and the remaining defendants were acquitted along with Mr. Trichet.

''For three years I have repeated that, together with my colleagues, I did my best to set right a difficult situation,'' he said, referring to the collapse of Crédit Lyonnais.
''I have never ceased to repeat that I had confidence in the justice system of my country.
Today, I can say that that confidence was well placed.''
Asked about succeeding Mr. Duisenberg, Mr. Trichet said: ''I submit myself completely to the decision of the heads of state and of government.
That goes without saying.
I have always done that and I will certainly continue to do it.''

Several European leaders with important roles in choosing the next central bank president welcomed Mr. Trichet's acquittal today and said that little now stood in the way of his appointment.
Romano Prodi, the former Italian prime minister who is now the president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive body, told a news conference in Brussels today that the acquittal ''makes the succession at the helm of the European Central Bank very much clearer, and that is to be welcomed.''

Christa Randzio-Plath, a German member of the European Parliament and chairwoman of its economic and monetary affairs committee, issued a statement calling Mr. Trichet ''an outstanding personality'' and saying he ''could be an excellent successor to President Duisenberg.''
Greece currently holds the rotating presidency of the union.
Mr. Duisenberg's tenure has not been without its rough spots.
He was often accused of failing to state or of misstating the bank's positions.
Moreover, he was dragged into disputes over the militancy of his wife, Gretta Duisenberg, in supporting the Palestinian cause against Israel, prompting accusations of anti-Semitism against him.

The European Central Bank, based in Frankfurt, sets a single monetary policy for the 12 countries that share the euro.
As the governor of the French central bank, Mr. Trichet already has a seat on the European bank's 18-member policy board.
If he succeeds Mr. Duisenberg, he will take over a bank widely criticized for failing to recognize how dismal the euro zone's growth prospects have become and for doing too little about it.
Philip Lane, an economist at Trinity College, Dublin, and an expert on the European Central Bank, said that its policies have been undergoing a review in recent months, especially since Lucas Papademos, the Greek central banker who is now the vice president of the bank's board, arrived last year.

Trained in the United States and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Mr. Papademos has helped redirect the bank's focus toward broader economic needs, a trend that Professor Lane said could be reinforced by Mr. Trichet, a mining engineer by training but a skilled political operative.
''Trichet has a big opportunity to place his stamp on the institution.''
Mr. Trichet, he said, would face challenges ''managing the extension process,'' as new member states from Eastern Europe enter the European Union and, presumably, seek to adopt the euro.

But he said that France has historically represented a ''slightly different tradition'' in monetary affairs that could lead to a ''more broad reconfiguration of how they make decisions, how they do business.''
Industry officials said the McDonald's decision would likely help alter the way animals are raised around the world because McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain and one of the world's biggest purchasers of meat.
The European Union has already begun to phase out the use of growth-promoting antibiotics.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Other major restaurants and food companies are expected to follow the lead of McDonald's and force suppliers to cut back antibiotic use.
Antibiotics are widely used in the production of poultry, beef and pork, usually to fight off and control disease, but also to foster quicker or more efficient growth in some animals, particularly chickens.
Meat producers often add growth hormones and growth-promoting antibiotics to animal feed to create faster-growing animals.
The McDonald's decision only affects the growth-promoting antibiotics.

The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the use of antibiotics in farm animals, deems them safe and effective.
But today, an F.D.A.
official praised McDonald's for responding to concerns that the overuse of antibiotics around the world could allow germs that infect humans to eventually become resistant to treatment.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
''McDonald's ought to be commended,'' said Dr. Linda Tollefson, deputy director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the F.D.A.
''The thinking is that less use of antibiotics is better in humans and animals.''
''This is not a decision motivated by science but by market research,'' said Dan Murphy, a spokesman for the American Meat Institute, which represents some of the nation's big meat suppliers.
''But we support them because perception is often reality.''

''While we respect McDonald's right to do this, where we decide to put our confidence is in a science-based decision-making process,'' said Ron Phillips, a spokesman for the institute, which is based in Washington.
''McDonald's has come to a marketing decision.''

The announcement by McDonald's is just the latest in a series of moves by big food and agriculture companies to respond to consumer and public health concerns about the way the nation's food is produced.
Environmental groups and animal rights activists have complained for years about the growth of factory farms, where animals are housed in crowded conditions, and big packing plants.

They have also complained about the development of genetically altered crops, which are increasingly common on America's farmlands, and the increasing farm dependence on antibiotics that help animals survive in crowded conditions or help them reach slaughter-weight faster.

Now, some of the biggest food and agriculture companies are responding by pressuring their suppliers to use a softer touch.
A year ago, several big poultry producing companies began quietly reducing the antibiotics they fed to healthy chickens to promote growth.

And in recent years, three of the nation's biggest fast-food outlets, McDonald's, Burger King and KFC, have hired animal welfare specialists and instituted new standards on the humane treatment of animals.

''These antibiotics are often used to compensate for the crowded stressful conditions that are found on many large animal-production facilities,'' she said.
Not all antibiotics are to be phased out, only growth-promoting antibiotics that are also used in human medicine.
For other antibiotics, McDonald's is simply encouraging and giving preference to suppliers that reduce their use of the drugs.

Antibiotic use in the United States is in decline, according to the Animal Health Institute, which said 21.8 million pounds of antibiotics were sold in 2001, down from 23.7 million pounds in 2000.
But there are very few reliable statistics on who uses them and what kinds are being used.

The government does not monitor antibiotic use and the companies are often reluctant to publish details or label their products.
Mr. Murphy of the American Meat Institute said that growth-promoting antibiotics are most widely used in poultry, but they are also used heavily in the production of hogs.
They are not widely used for cattle, he said.

Tyson, the world's largest beef and poultry producer, says it does not use growth-promoting antibiotics in its poultry products.
Its beef products come from ranchers, so much less is known about antibiotic use in beef, the company said.
Cargill, another meat giant, declined today to say whether or not it uses growth-promoting antibiotics.
But Dr. Tollefson, at the F.D.A., said that in the United States ''most animals are produced using growth-promoters.''

Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Wendy's International, said it was ''considering additional steps to reduce the use of antibiotics by our livestock and poultry supplier network.''
How to explain the bond market's behavior?
Analysts and market watchers offer a number of opinions -- so many and so varied, in fact, that many investors despair of getting a clear picture of what is going on, itself a worrying sign.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The conventional wisdom is that across the economy, there is no end to deflation in sight, leaving the Bank of Japan little choice but to hold interest rates near zero indefinitely.
But the end of the principal fighting in Iraq and some recent hints that the global economy is mending have put new impetus into stock prices: the Nikkei 225 index is up 19.9 percent since April 28.
Some analysts see in that the cause of the bond blip: investors selling bonds to buy stocks.
Other analysts say it has more to do with the recent government bailout of Resona Holdings, the country's fifth-largest banking group.
The government plans to spend 2 trillion yen ($16.7 billion) propping up Resona.
While some analysts applaud the government's decision to fix Resona, others worry about the cost of applying the same approach to other struggling banks.
Then there are analysts who say it is all a simple matter of bond yields having fallen too low to justify buying more of them.
To accept yields of less than 0.5 percent, investors have to believe that Japan will be mired in an economic funk well into the next decade -- possible but doubtful, some analysts said.

''Bonds are fundamentally a bad value at 50 basis points,'' said Richard Jerram, economist at ING Financial Markets in Tokyo, referring to hundredths of a percentage point.
''It's hard to believe yields should be this low when the government is going to issue so much new debt.''

Curiously, some in the government are happy to see bond yields tick upward.
With Japan's public debt expected to grow to about 140 percent of its gross domestic product by next March, some politicians say the long decline in interest rates has made it too easy for the government to blithely borrow to pay for wasteful make-work public projects while postponing spending cuts and deregulation moves that would be less popular with constituents but would do more long-term good.
Already, one-fifth of the total national budget is devoted to debt payments.

The governor of the Bank of Japan, Toshihiko Fukui, has issued similar warnings, partly because the central bank now holds huge amounts of government bonds and could lose trillions of yen if the bond market were to collapse suddenly instead of declining in an orderly way.
Even with all the worries, though, many investors still see government bonds as the only safe haven for their capital.
The stock market remains volatile despite its recent gains, they reason, but no one thinks the government is likely to default on its obligations.
''It's the same thing we've been seeing for years: Where else do you put your money?''
In Washington, varying relief mechanisms are being sought, but all would have the same effect: to reduce the amounts that employers set aside today for benefits due in the future.

The long-term effects of that could be harmful.
Federal officials have spent the last quarter-century prodding companies to fully fund their pension plans; they say that ballooning pension deficits show a need for more contributions, not exemptions.
In their quest for pension relief, the major airlines have hired Richard A. Grafmeyer, the same lobbyist whom Greyhound used to secure its break in 1997.
Mr. Grafmeyer is also a former deputy staff director of the Senate Finance Committee and a former deputy chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.
He has declined to discuss the matter.
Greyhound, meanwhile, is seeking to expand its own break and to make it permanent, because the original exemption is set to expire in 2010.
Now, as in 1997, Greyhound says special treatment is necessary because its plan covers an unusually old group of workers, whose life expectancies are shorter than national norms for all pension participants.
Workers who won't live long enough to cash many pension checks don't require very big pension contributions.

Other business and labor groups are calling for pension measures that would bring relief by adjusting mortality tables, allowing pension plans more time to account for investment losses, reducing pension-insurance premiums and changing the interest rate that is used in computing pension liabilities.

BILLIONS of dollars are at issue, but teasing out the details is difficult because current, specific data on individual pension plans was made secret by an act of Congress in 1994.

The absence of facts has not chilled the debate.
Proponents of pension relief say the economic recovery itself may be at stake.
''Companies cannot commit to building new plants, launching new research projects or hiring new employees if that cash is needed to fund pensions,'' wrote Glen A. Barton, the chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar and a member of the Business Roundtable -- an elite group of corporate chief executives -- in a recent letter to each member of Congress.
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow is a former chairman of the Roundtable.
But from the other side come warnings that the funding rules need to be tightened, not relaxed.
Giving one company a break can ''give other financially distressed companies a blueprint for how to 'borrow' from their pension plans,'' said Steven A. Kandarian, executive director of the federal agency that insures pensions, in Senate testimony in January.

In the worst case, the United States Treasury -- in other words, the taxpayers -- would have to step in, because traditional pensions are guaranteed by the federal government, and the pension insurance agency is itself in poor shape and unable to absorb large claims indefinitely.

Weakening funding rules increases the risk to the government's insurance program, pension analysts say.

For Greyhound, as for many other companies, the pension troubles began with deregulation.
A contract agreement settling the strike, which lasted seven weeks, freed Greyhound from ever having to make any more pension contributions.
''But everybody kept accruing benefits.''
In traditional pension plans, workers accrue, or build up, bigger pensions with each year of service, amassing the largest portion just before they retire.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In 1990, there was another, much longer strike.
Greyhound, threatening to end the pension plan entirely, won another concession from the drivers when the strike ended in 1993: if the pension plan needed money, the workers would pay, in effect, by allowing their accruals to stop.
Benefits would be frozen, no matter how many years drivers stayed behind the wheel.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
For Mr. Herbold and the other drivers in the plan, the threat of a pension freeze set a clock ticking.
Drivers with less than 30 years of service could only hope that they would achieve their maximum benefits and retire before the plan became underfunded and accruals were frozen.
They did not know when that might happen.
Once a worker has earned pension benefits, an employer cannot legally take them away.

But in 1994, Congress changed the rules for pensions.
By assuming that employees would not live long enough to cash many pension checks, the companies could shrink their mandatory contributions, saving money.

Congress cracked down, requiring all companies to use a standard mortality table.
''THESE are very old people in this plan, and they've been dying, in fact, 30 percent faster than the mortality table is saying,'' Mr. Hardock said.
''If you have to fund your plan as if people are going to live for 15 or 20 years, and in fact they're only living 10 or 11 years, you just end up with too much money'' in the pension fund.

Normally, a pension plan that dips below 90 percent for an extended time is considered underfunded, and the company must make special, accelerated contributions.
''By helping this plan, you are not causing any risk to the participants,'' she said.
''You're actually helping the plan to survive.''
Greyhound's exemption was inserted into a broad 1997 tax bill, written without mentioning Greyhound or pensions directly.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Indeed, many businesses and unions are saying this year that the standard mortality table is behind many pension problems, and are calling for permission to adjust it.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But Greyhound's pension plan administrator, Paul Owsley, a former driver who is an employee of the pension trust, was skeptical of contentions about the mortality rate of Greyhound's bus drivers and a lessened need for contributions.
''Our oldest participant now is 102 years old,'' he said.
''The average age is well over 80.
These longer life expectancies have put the plan in jeopardy, because they draw money out of the plan.''
Currently, the Greyhound plan pays about $75 million a year to pensioners, he said.

In any case, the 1997 exemption did not bring enough relief.

Complicating matters, Greyhound by that point had been acquired by Laidlaw Inc. of Canada.
Laidlaw has its own problems; it sought bankruptcy court protection from its creditors in 2001, two years after the takeover, and plans to emerge from its court-supervised reorganization on Monday.
Laidlaw's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission warn that any pension contributions ''could have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition of Greyhound.''
By that time, a vast majority of the drivers -- about 14,000 -- had beaten the clock, fulfilling their 30 years and retiring with maximum benefits.
Only about 800 drivers covered by the plan were on the road, striving for their 30 years, too.
One of them is Mr. Herbold, a 27-year Greyhound veteran.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Not surprisingly, Mr. Herbold has strong feelings about this, and about pension policy in general.
Enforce the funding rules too rigorously, he said, and the country will end up with weak companies that default on their pension promises and stronger companies that refuse to offer pensions.

''We're going to create this whole class of people 30 years from now that's going to be dependent on the government, because corporate America has decided that it's not their responsibility.
It's going to be a big, huge problem,'' he said.
For the remaining drivers to get their maximum benefits, Greyhound would have to lift the freeze.
But Greyhound's labor contract says that this cannot be done unless the pension plan climbs back up to 115 percent funding.
That is extremely unlikely -- unless the rules change.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Laidlaw's government filings say Greyhound and the union are trying ''to negotiate a method for avoiding contributions.''
A pension bill already passed by the House contains a provision to let Greyhound deem its pension plan to be 90 percent funded in perpetuity, no matter how low the real percentage falls.
It would also exempt Greyhound from the standard mortality table.
''They don't tell us anything, so I don't know what they're driving at,'' he said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Such a measure, Mr. Owsley said, could ruin the pension fund.
''With a flat stock market,'' he said, ''when you're not taking anything in and you're paying out $75 million a year, it doesn't take too many years before you're in trouble.''

WOULD it really be so bad to bend the pension rules for just one troubled company, long enough to let 800 bus drivers earn the pensions they expected?

Even if the plan failed, the government would step in and start issuing the 14,000 pension checks.
The pension agency's coverage has limits, but the drivers' benefits are not extravagant -- the top annual payment is around $20,000 -- so all would get their benefits if the federal agency took over the plan.
The pension plan has a deficit of about $42 million, according to Laidlaw's most recent filings -- hardly enough to swamp the pension insurance agency.
What scares federal regulators is not the Greyhound case, but the likelihood that larger companies will use it as a precedent.
As airlines run up enormous losses, the Air Line Pilots Association, as well as several airlines, are advocating industrywide pension relief.
So far, they have won sympathy from some lawmakers, but no sponsors for an airline pension relief bill.
The failure of any pilots' pension plan would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the government's obligations; together, America's passenger airlines had a pension shortfall totaling $26 billion at the end of 2002.

On that day, thousands of protesters flooded San Francisco's financial district in what would be the most disruptive antiwar action anywhere in the nation.

Three months later, some residents remain angry about the disruption and are demanding that the district attorney's office punish those people who were arrested in the protest.
But others insist the staunchly Democratic city should stand up to the Bush administration and show solidarity with the antiwar movement by dropping all the charges.
''I know I can't make everybody happy,'' said District Attorney Terence Hallinan, who is being lobbied by both sides.
''I long ago figured I can only do what I think is right.''
Over the past week or so, the first several hundred defendants have appeared before Commissioner Slavit.

A veteran of the 1960's protest movement, Mr. Hallinan said he wanted to give the demonstrators the benefit of the doubt while also avoiding the expense and hassle of pursuing so many prosecutions.
Officials estimate that 2,300 cases remain in the legal system.

''My policy generally is that the arrest itself in these cases is sufficient punishment,'' he said.

But it seems Mr. Hallinan miscalculated the mind-set of the current band of protesters.
Far from professing gratitude for the reduced charges, most of the arrested demonstrators are choosing to fight the infractions, which carry a fine of about $100.
The National Lawyers Guild, which is representing most of the protesters, has used every legal mechanism available to challenge the cases.

The money question is carrying particular resonance for the city government, too, because of its budget crisis.
As he contemplates what action to take, Mr. Hallinan said he was painfully aware that a decision to prosecute all 2,300 remaining cases, even in traffic court, would break the bank because most of those arrested would demand a trial.

In a city where the district attorney's office has often been a political lightning rod, some of Mr. Hallinan's adversaries, including Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr., have also jumped to question his hold on the job.
Mr. Hallinan, who is seeking re-election this fall, has often been accused by his critics of being soft on crime and at loggerheads with the police department.
