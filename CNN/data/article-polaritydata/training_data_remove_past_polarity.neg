Only two people at a time can participate in this work (there is no other audience; so much for the producer’s fantasy).
It requires the audience-members-turned-actors to follow a recorded script and essentially perform for one another.
The show, which makes the point quite creatively that every conversation is a performance, opened in London in February and has been performed in Portugal, Argentina, Germany, Norway, Italy and Minneapolis (where it was an installation in the lobby of the Guthrie Theater).
It has yet to be presented in New York, but Mark Russell, producer of the Under the Radar festival, says he is currently “working out the details” for a production next year.
“Etiquette” is not technically part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe — Rotozaza wanted to avoid the application fee — but it’s playing during the duration of the Fringe (which opened Sunday and runs through Aug. 27) in the cafe of one of its busy performance spots, Aurora Nova.

“Take a deep breath and clear your throat,” a woman told me in an authoritative English accent, before explaining that the table before me was a stage and I was an actor who didn’t know my lines.

Since for much of “Etiquette” (which begins every half-hour, from 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.) the participants are wearing headphones and speaking in a conversational tone of voice, others in the cafe pay no attention and are possibly unaware that a performance is even under way.

I then played an old philosopher trying to start a conversation with a beautiful stranger.
It was a stilted exchange, but that might have just been my overacting.
“It often happens to me,” said my wife, repeating dialogue.
“I know what I want to say.
I think before speaking to check if it’s really what I should say.
But when the moment comes to speak: Pfft!
I can’t say it.” Still following orders, I shrugged and said: “No one’s written your lines.

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a pack of girls laughing at what must have looked like an embarrassing marital spat.

“There’s something very rare and special when two people find a bubble in a public space,” Ms. Mercuriali said in an interview.
“It’s like when two people have a genuine exchange of ideas or when they are falling in love.
It’s that sense of event and of moment that we’re trying to recreate.”

Mr. Hampton and Ms. Mercuriali founded Rotozaza (named after a sculpture by the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely) in 1998 after meeting at a theater workshop in Italy.
They began experimenting with guest performers as a way to help a friend overcome stage fright.
They wrote a play, “[Bloke],” that he could star in while having his lines fed to him through headphones.

“There is a quality to unrehearsed performance that can be quite beautiful, but it’s something that any good actor could fake,” Mr. Hampton said.
“It’s more about the situation in the room.
If you tell an audience that these are unrehearsed, they become invested in what is going on in a very different way.”

Indeed, part of the reason their shows are so gripping is the constant threat of disaster: flubbed lines, missed cues, technical difficulties.
Some of these errors are built into the script just to remind audiences that they are indeed watching a live performance that could at any point go terribly wrong.
“Audiences are desperate for something that isn’t contrived and Rotozaza gives it to them by playing with the idea of real people losing control,” said Vallejo Gantner, artistic director of Performance Space 122 in Manhattan, which presented two of Rotozaza’s shows, “Five in the Morning” and “Doublethink,” earlier this year.
At the same time, Rotozaza’s work exists in a tightly controlled world in which free will can seem like an illusion.
In “Five in the Morning,” for instance, three willing guest performers (or are they real?)
tremble inside a futuristic amusement park, Aquaworld, while a disembodied voice orders them to perform various mundane and humiliating tasks.

“Etiquette,” however, is slightly different since the characters appear paralyzed by themselves.
“I’m not very optimistic about real communication,” Ms. Mercuriali said.
“There’s this constant inner dialogue in which we’re worried about what others think of us.
In real life, we are both performer and audience member.
Our show isn’t any different.”
This could turn out to be nothing more than a brief scare.
At worst, however, it could cause a chain reaction of debt defaults.

The origins of the current crunch lie in the financial follies of the last few years, which in retrospect were as irrational as the dot-com mania.
But investors also snapped up high-yield corporate debt, a k a junk bonds, driving the spread between junk bond yields and U.S. Treasuries down to record lows.
First, the housing bubble popped.
Then subprime melted down.
Since then, markets have been manic-depressive, with triple-digit gains or losses in the Dow Jones industrial average — the rule rather than the exception for the past two weeks.

But yesterday’s announcement by BNP Paribas, a large French bank, that it was suspending the operations of three of its own funds was, if anything, the most ominous news yet.
The suspension was necessary, the bank said, because of “the complete evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments” — that is, there are no buyers.

When liquidity dries up, as I said, it can produce a chain reaction of defaults.
Financial institution A can’t sell its mortgage-backed securities, so it can’t raise enough cash to make the payment it owes to institution B, which then doesn’t have the cash to pay institution C — and those who do have cash sit on it, because they don’t trust anyone else to repay a loan, which makes things even worse.

And here’s the truly scary thing about liquidity crises: it’s very hard for policy makers to do anything about them.
The Fed normally responds to economic problems by cutting interest rates — and as of yesterday morning the futures markets put the probability of a rate cut by the Fed before the end of next month at almost 100 percent.
It can also lend money to banks that are short of cash: yesterday the European Central Bank, the Fed’s trans-Atlantic counterpart, lent banks $130 billion, saying that it would provide unlimited cash if necessary, and the Fed pumped in $24 billion.
But when liquidity dries up, the normal tools of policy lose much of their effectiveness.
Reducing the cost of money doesn’t do much for borrowers if nobody is willing to make loans.
Ensuring that banks have plenty of cash doesn’t do much if the cash stays in the banks’ vaults.
There are other, more exotic things the Fed and, more important, the executive branch of the U.S. government could do to contain the crisis if the standard policies don’t work.
But for a variety of reasons, not least the current administration’s record of incompetence, we’d really rather not go there.

Let’s hope, then, that this crisis blows over as quickly as that of 1998.
But I wouldn’t count on it.
Lower interest rates would help operators of hedge funds and other money managers because the housing market presumably would strengthen as mortgage rates fell.
A revived mortgage market would give the hedge fund operators and other holders of the risky securities a chance to sell them, which they are having trouble doing now in the current nervous market.

But others see a bigger danger for the economy in acting on the pleas of Mr. Cramer and others on Wall Street.
Cutting interest rates to help the hedge funds would tend to encourage a resurgence of the very risky mortgage lending that has caused the current turmoil, rekindling the crisis.
The issue is often referred to as “moral hazard,” meaning that the risk-takers who brought on this panic would feel bailed out and would be more likely do it again — just as a young adult whose parents paid off a large credit card bill might feel free to run up a debt again.
“They are getting punished now, and if you ease interest rates, you reduce the punishment.” Mr. Bernanke sees the issue in a more pragmatic way.
The Fed’s actions and words suggest that, far from concerning himself with moral hazard, the Fed chairman is trying to protect, and thus reassure, ordinary investors in stocks and bonds.

By pumping a total of $62 billion on Thursday and yesterday into the pool of funds available for lending, the Fed can help enable small investors to continue to trade securities, confident that the checks they receive from their brokers will not bounce.
This new liquidity allows the banks to provide credit to the marketplace without driving up interest rates.

Short-term rates, in fact, had spiked because of the panic, and the Fed’s action brought the key rate that it controls back to the 5.25 percent level that the Fed considers about right to keep the economy growing while minimizing the risk of higher inflation and, eventually, a slowing economy.

“The first line of defense for dealing with a liquidity problem is to make sure the system has enough reserves, so there can be an adequate amount of lending,” said Brian Sack, an economist at Macro Economic Advisers.
The next line of defense, if the market jitters were to persist and threaten a recession, would be to cut interest rates.
Mr. Cramer and some others on Wall Street want Mr. Bernanke to do that now.

Mr. Bernanke has kept the so-called federal funds rate steady for more than a year, arguing as recently as this week that the economy is reasonably strong and that cutting interest rates might drive up inflation.

“The predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected,” the Fed said in a statement after its last policy meeting, on Tuesday.

Still, if the panic persists and the economy begins to suffer, Mr. Bernanke would presumably be forced to rely on the only other tool the Fed has: a rate cut.

His training, and the books and scholarly papers he has written, suggest he would be reluctant to do that.
In some circles, he has been called Helicopter Ben, because of a 2002 speech in which he suggested that if interest rates went to zero in a very weak economy, he would resort to showering money from helicopters into the financial system to keep it humming.
Some have cited the nickname in urging him to cut interest rates, which is a different issue than the one he was discussing in 2002.
Indeed, his background suggests a different way of thinking, one in which market panics should be dealt with not by cutting interest rates but by focusing on short-term liquidity.

As a Princeton University economist, for example, he wrote extensively in the 1980s about the causes of the Great Depression.
He produced two major books on the subject and he argued that the Fed could have prevented the damaging bank runs if it had provided the necessary liquidity, as he is trying to do now, thus calming depositors instead of forcing banks to turn them away empty-handed.
The Fed failed to do so in the 1930s, departing from tradition.
For more than 150 years, Mr. Bernanke has noted, central banks have played the role of lender of last resort, providing enough liquidity to allow banks to operate normally, regardless of the pressures on them.

Some argue that if Mr. Bernanke is unwilling to cut the federal funds rate of 5.25 percent — the interest that banks pay to borrow from the marketplace — then the Fed should at least cut its discount rate.
This is the rate that the Fed charges to lend money directly to banks and other lending institutions, and it is now at 6.25 percent.
Mr. Cramer, among others, has called for a discount rate cut, but Mr. Hatzius argues that such a cut might add to the gathering crisis.

Most traders, he notes, expect that by the end of the year, the Fed will have cut the federal funds rate by half a percentage point.

“If the Fed were to cut the discount rate,” Mr. Hatzius said, “then you would multiply the expectations of a much bigger cut in the federal funds rate, and that in itself could be damaging for the economy.”
For all the turmoil in the markets this past week, the number of people involved appears to be relatively small.
They are mostly engaged in hedge funds, banks and mortgage lending and they are usually wealthy.
Hedge funds, for example, require investors to have a net worth of at least $5 million.
“It is a limited crisis as of now,” said Albert M. Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist.
“And if I had to bet my life, I would bet that it would remain that way.
But I would not want to bet my life.”
In Mr. Durham’s case, there were two important benefits: he had other uses for the money and, by stretching the payments over several years, he could put off paying some of the sales tax.
For a car in this price bracket, taxes alone can run to six figures, depending on where the deal is struck.

“One of the biggest things is you’re deferring your tax because the sales tax is getting stretched over some period of time,” said Mr. Durham, whose investment firm, Obsidian Enterprises, controls several industrial companies as well as National Lampoon.
Although he expects to buy the Bugatti by the end of the five-year lease term — at an additional cost of several hundred thousand dollars — Mr. Durham said he would rather invest the difference in the meantime.
He also said he expected that in coming years the Bugatti would be worth more than he has agreed to pay for it.
“If you think you can make more on your money than the cost of the lease, then you ought to lease, especially on an appreciating asset like the Bugatti,” Mr. Durham said in late July, as he prepared to drive the 1,001-horsepower Veyron in the Great American Run, a coast-to-coast rally.

Mr. Durham said his collection of more than 70 cars was filled with models that had sentimental value to him, including vintage Auburns, Cords and Duesenbergs and an Aston Martin DB5 like the one James Bond drove in “Goldfinger.”

But he still drives a sharp bargain when it comes to acquiring them: he had a lease lined up for the Veyron with a company that specializes in financing Ferraris and other expensive cars when a competing offer landed.

Donald Fort, a collector in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., said leasing his acquisitions had allowed him to build his collection twice as fast.
His collection now includes rare American sports cars like a 1963 Corvette Z06.
Since then, he has leased cars like a Shelby Cobra over five years, then bought them at the end of the lease.
Typically, the down payment is 20 percent to 25 percent of the purchase price.

But Steven Posner, chief executive of Putnam, said that many of his company’s first-time customers leased for the opposite reason.

“Why invest so much money in a depreciating asset?” Mr. Posner said, referring to the possibility that the exotic brands on which Putnam built its business do not always gain value, especially when first introduced.
About two-thirds of the people leasing a new Ferrari do not keep it until the end of the lease, Mr. Posner said.
Many of them decide to trade up to a newer or more expensive model, he said, while some others decide that they have had their fling with hot Italian models.

“You’ll get a young man in his 20s on Wall Street” who leases a Ferrari 355, Mr. Posner said.
“As he makes more money, he will trade that in for a 360.
In the interim, he’ll get on a list for a 430.
“Within two years, you’ll see a guy go from one car to the next to the next,” he said.
To accommodate capricious enthusiasts, Putnam allows its customers to trade out of one car into another under the same lease, charging no penalty, just the difference between the wholesale value of the first car at the time and Putnam’s price for the new one, Mr. Posner said.

But leasing a superluxury item like a Bentley or a Bugatti would be too pretentious for most people in some regions of the country, said Mitch Katz, chief executive of Premier Financial Services, a finance company based in Woodbury, Conn.
“They feel that to own a toy like this, if they can’t write the check, they shouldn’t own it,” Mr. Katz said, “That’s more the prevailing feeling in the Midwest and New England.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Only about one-fourth of these very expensive cars are leased, Mr. Katz estimated.
About half are bought for cash and the rest are purchased with the help of a bank loan, he said.
About half of the leases are held in the names of corporations, whose owners have found a way to claim some or all of the cost as a business expense, he added.

Mr. Katz said his company sent representatives to major auctions of collector cars, offering financing to successful bidders.
Location is also an important factor in the financing because many states allow leaseholders to pay sales tax month by month.
New York and New Jersey are two that do not, Mr. Posner said.
For example, a customer who lives in Manhattan and registers his car there pays 8.375 percent tax on the entire lease value upfront; that would come to more than $130,000 on Mr. Durham’s Bugatti (and there is no credit if the lease is broken early).
But Mr. Durham, the Indianapolis financier, can pay that state’s 6 percent tax with each lease payment.
Still, Indiana does have its disadvantages for a collector who likes to take his prized possessions out for a regular spin.

“Of course, I drive a different one every day,” Mr. Durham said.

Thornburg has prospered until now with a fairly simple formula.
Organized as a REIT, it paid big dividends representing all of its taxable income.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The insiders profited hugely from that.
The company gets away with not disclosing how much the bosses are paid because it is managed by a separate company owned by some of the bosses.
That management company gets incentive fees based on book value and profits that would seem familiar to a hedge fund manager.
Effectively, the bosses get a cut every time the company sells new stock, and keep getting cuts from those sales every year unless and until they lose the money.
Now Thornburg, and many other companies, need a quick defreezing of the credit markets.
But even if they get it — if the Fed tells banks to rescue them with emergency loans — many may find that they cannot safely operate with such high leverage.
And without the leverage, profits will be harder to make even if Thornburg can charge more for mortgage loans.

It is sort of like a game of musical chairs in which the music stops and it turns out that all the chairs have vanished.
According to data released yesterday, both housing starts and applications for building permits have fallen to their lowest levels in a decade, showing that home construction is still in free fall.
And if historical relationships are any guide, home prices are still way too high.
The housing slump will probably be with us for years, not months.
Meanwhile, it’s becoming clear that the mortgage problem is anything but contained.
There are also growing problems in so-called Alt-A mortgages (don’t ask), which are another 20 percent of the mortgage market.
Problems are starting to appear in prime loans, too — all of which is what you would expect given the depth of the housing slump.
Many on Wall Street are clamoring for a bailout — for Fannie Mae or the Federal Reserve or someone to step in and buy mortgage-backed securities from troubled hedge funds.

For it is becoming increasingly clear that the real-estate bubble of recent years, like the stock bubble of the late 1990s, both caused and was fed by widespread malfeasance.
Rating agencies like Moody’s Investors Service, which get paid a lot of money for rating mortgage-backed securities, seem to have played a similar role to that played by complaisant accountants in the corporate scandals of a few years ago.
Three other men now say, as Joe Dick does, that they falsely confessed to involvement in the rape and murder of Moore-Bosko under pressure from Ford.
Damian J. Hansen, one of three assistant commonwealth’s attorneys who prosecuted the so-called Norfolk Four and four other men for the murder, says their claims are nothing more than “sound bites” invented by “hired gun” experts and what he calls the “clemency gang,” a team of high-powered New York and Washington attorneys who have asked Gov.
Tim Kaine to grant the Norfolk Four an absolute pardon.
“There is no new evidence” of innocence, Hansen says.
“There are no unanswered questions.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Nevertheless, the Norfolk Four count a growing list of supporters, including four former Virginia attorneys general, one of them a Republican, who have no obvious motive for suggesting that the state perpetrated a major miscarriage of justice.
George Allen, said the “totality of the scientific evidence” and “the crime scene being inconsistent with the prosecution theory” convinced him that the four are innocent.
Governor Kaine, a Democrat, will be under enormous pressure to reject clemency for the three defendants serving life sentences and a fourth who was released after more than eight years in prison.
Moreover, a pardon would probably be seen as a tacit repudiation of the police and prosecutors.
Assuming Kaine can set politics aside and focus solely on the voluminous evidence, he is likely to find that the controversy turns on two complex and interrelated questions.
Because the state had no outside witnesses and no physical evidence linking any of the four to the crime — no blood, saliva, hair, fibers, fingerprints or DNA — the case rested almost entirely on the defendants’ own confessions, all given in the absence of attorneys.
Second, Kaine will have to decide whether the crime was committed by eight men, as the state maintains, or by one man, as is argued by Cullen and other defenders of the Norfolk Four.
More specifically, he might want to examine how the state’s theory evolved from a crime committed by a single perpetrator to one involving two assailants, then three, six, seven and finally eight men who the state says took turns raping and stabbing the 18-year-old victim.

Two Confessions, Two Versions of The Crime
The Gates of West Bay apartments are a modest collection of tidy, two-story red-brick buildings located only a short walk from Gate 4 of the Norfolk naval station.

On July 8, 1997, Bill returned from a week at sea aboard the U.S.S.
Now 35 and serving a life sentence at the Sussex II State Prison in Waverly, Va., Williams, like the other Norfolk Four defendants, had no prior criminal record.
But he said in an interview (and in an affidavit) that Ford treated him like a criminal from the outset, poking him in the chest, yelling in his face, calling him a liar and telling him, falsely, that he’d failed a polygraph test and that a witness saw him go into the apartment.
“They wear you down to the point that you’re exhausted.
I just wanted the questioning to end.”
Ford has testified on several occasions that he has never coerced or threatened witnesses, fed them information or otherwise encouraged a false confession.

Based on their statements to the police, Dick and Williams might seem an odd pair of accomplices.
Williams denied choking her and said he didn’t use a weapon.
Neither Dick nor Williams could accurately describe the knife.
None of this seemed to trouble Ford or the prosecutors.
The state argued that the defendants’ accounts of what happened were consistent “at their core,” and that guilty people often lie or change their stories before telling the truth confessing.
But Richard J. Ofshe, an expert on police interrogations who was hired by lawyers for the Norfolk Four, says the Williams and Dick misstatements and others that would follow are typical of a “classic false confession” and are evidence of the defendants’ innocence.
Or so says Dr. Werner U. Spitz, a medical doctor and professor of forensic pathology at Wayne State University School of Medicine who has worked on nearly 60,000 autopsies over 50 years.
Spitz, who was hired by the Norfolk Four attorneys, says a careful examination of the victim’s wounds make it “extraordinarily unlikely that more than one person” wielded the knife and “even less likely that several people” stabbed her to death.
Assuming the state’s final theory, that eight men took turns stabbing the victim through her black T-shirt, Spitz wondered out loud, “How does the next guy know where to stab her?” to get this concentrated pattern with wounds at precisely the same angle.
I asked Dr. John E. Adams, a Maryland forensic pathologist who has testified in more than 500 cases but not in the Norfolk Four case, to look at the autopsy and knife-wound evidence.
He points out that the wound evidence, the appearance of the apartment and the inconsistencies in the defendants’ statements were all thoroughly aired.
What the juries also heard, most convincingly, was the one thing that is almost impossible to rebut — a defendant’s recorded confession.
A confession, one legal scholar wrote, “makes the other aspects of a trial in court superfluous.”

But his continued insistence on the guilt of Danser and Pauley has raised more than a few questions about the credibility of the rest of the case against the Norfolk Four.

Why Would Someone Falsely Confess?
Because most suspects who confess to a crime are in fact guilty, it is not surprising that most of us have a hard time accepting the idea that someone would falsely confess.
Yes, there are torture victims and malleable children and publicity seekers.
But grown men in the U.S. military?
“People just do not confess,” Hansen told jurors in Tice’s second trial, “to something of this magnitude, this heinous, this vicious, without having participated in it.
It’s just not natural; it’s just not reasonable.”
That is certainly the conventional wisdom.
But consider, for example, the case of Billy Gene Davis, who, after twice failing a polygraph test, confessed to killing his girlfriend in Austin, Tex., in 1990.
According to the Innocence Project, 49 people whose convictions relied on false confessions have been proved innocent and released from prison based on DNA evidence.
In Virginia, Earl Washington Jr., a mentally retarded man, spent 17 years in prison after falsely confessing to the rape and murder of a 19-year-old mother of three.
But why do some people confess when others don’t?
Ochoa confessed; Danziger didn’t.
Along the continuum from mild questioning to torture, it is difficult to predict when, if ever, any particular individual will break down and confess, truthfully or not.
Nevertheless, studies of proved false confessions suggest a number of recurring markers including actual violence, threats of violence, threats of harsh sentences like execution and extreme duress brought about by isolation, sleeplessness and lengthy, high-pressure interrogation.
Police interrogation is designed to be stressful and disorienting and to keep the suspect off-balance.
Guilt is frequently presumed.
Police may legally pressure suspects using fabricated evidence, phony witnesses and lies about DNA or polygraph results.
But it’s also the case that all of these men had served in the military.
Dick and Tice are sons of veterans.
All four were used to taking orders.
(One study found that approximately 80 percent of suspects waive the right to counsel, and people with no prior felony record are more likely to do so.)

Two law professors who study the false-confession phenomenon, Steven Drizin and Richard Leo, claim that police detectives “typically close” an investigation once they obtain any confession, “even if the confession is internally inconsistent, contradicted by external evidence or the result of coercive interrogation.” After all, it seems so unreasonable to think that someone would confess to a crime he didn’t commit.
Likewise, the authors wrote, prosecutors “rarely consider the possibility that an entirely innocent suspect has been made to confess falsely through the use of psychologically coercive and/or improper interrogation methods.”

Ford certainly knew false confessions were possible.
Ford has acknowledged that the three falsely confessed to being at the scene of the murder but insisted that they helped to plan the crime.
Whether Ford “obtained a false confession or not seems to me to be relatively benign,” Poston said, “because I suspect that many police officers have done that, because we have all seen people who confess to anything.” Poston opined that it was neither “unusual” nor “rare” for people to confess to crimes “totally imagined.”

But three jurors I interviewed from Tice’s first trial were anything but blasé about his 18-minute taped confession.
The tape is, indeed, chilling.

Finally, A DNA Match
By December 1998, 18 months after the murder, the state had seven men imprisoned but still no DNA match.
Curiously, a warrant for Ballard’s arrest for the baseball-bat assault was issued the same evening the police were grilling their first suspect, Danial Williams, putting Ballard squarely on the police radar for a crime committed only a few hundred feet from the murder scene.
At the end of his recorded confession, Ford asked Ballard, “Is there anything you wish to add to this statement?” Ballard replied, “No, just them four people that opened their mouths is stupid.”

Ballard’s confession complicated the state’s case yet again.
Under the new theory, Ballard, who has an extensive criminal record and a history of assaulting women, protected seven men he didn’t know.
According to the state, he did so because he was at the time serving a life sentence and feared being labeled a “snitch.” Moreover, prosecutors argued, Ballard, who is black, was afraid people would know he’d committed a crime with “white boys.” At the same time, the state’s theory would mean that the white defendants, who didn’t have criminal records, resolutely refused to name Ballard under grueling interrogations even though three of them were willing to incriminate other accomplices, simply because they were afraid of Ballard.
Lawyers for the Norfolk Four say the obvious reason Ballard didn’t identify the seven whites was that he didn’t know them, they didn’t know him and he committed the crime alone.
That’s why the apartment is largely undisturbed, the knife wounds are in a tight pattern and the DNA matches only Ballard’s.
A year after confessing and telling Ford he acted alone, Ballard was brought to the Norfolk Police interrogation room, where he claims Ford told him that in order to “escape the death penalty,” he would have to sign off on “a version of the story that I never heard of before.” Ballard says he agreed to incriminate the Norfolk Four in exchange for two life sentences.
He now says the statement he signed was “totally false.”

Ballard never testified before a jury against any of the Norfolk Four defendants.
In his little booth on the top of Keen Mountain, Joe Dick says he never should have named Eric Wilson and Derek Tice.
For his part, Derek Tice, whose conviction was overturned but who remains in prison awaiting a third trial, says he feels “horrible” that in “trying to save my own life” he brought “three innocent people” into the case.
“If I could talk to them, I would ask their forgiveness and hope that they would understand.” Senior Chief Michael Ziegler, now based in Nevada, says he regrets he didn’t do more to save Joe Dick.
“I wish I’d gone and forced someone to listen to me — Joe’s lawyer, the police, the D.A.
I couldn’t conceive that someone who was obviously innocent was going to go to jail.

Traditional banks promise depositors the right to withdraw their funds at any time.
Yet banks lend out most of the money depositors place in their care, keeping only a fraction in cash.
The reason this works is that normally a bank’s depositors want to withdraw only a small proportion of their money on any given day.

Banks get in trouble, however, when some event, like a rumor that major loans have gone bad, leads many depositors to demand their money at the same time.
The scary thing about bank runs is that doubts about a bank’s soundness can be a self-fulfilling prophecy: a bank that should be safely in the black can nonetheless fail if it’s forced to sell assets in a hurry.
And bank failures can have devastating economic effects.
Many economists believe that the banking panic of the early 1930s, not the stock market crash of 1929, was the principal cause of the Great Depression.

That’s why bank deposits are now protected by a combination of guarantees and regulation.
On one side, deposits are federally insured, and the Federal Reserve stands ready to rush cash to troubled banks if necessary.
On the other side, banks are required to keep adequate reserves, have adequate capital and make conservative loans.

But these guarantees and regulations apply only to traditional banks.
Meanwhile, a growing number of unregulated bank-like institutions have become vulnerable to the 21st-century version of bank runs.

Consider the case of KKR Financial Holdings, an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a powerhouse Wall Street operator.
KKR Financial raises money by issuing asset-backed commercial paper — a claim that’s sort of like a short-term C.D., used by large investors to temporarily park funds — and invests most of this money in longer-term assets.
So the company is acting as a kind of bank, one that offers a higher interest rate than ordinary banks pay their clients.

It sounds like a great deal — except that last week KKR Financial announced that it was seeking to delay $5 billion in repayments.
That’s the equivalent of a bank closing its doors because it’s running out of cash.

The problems at KKR Financial are part of a broader picture in which many investors, spooked by the problems in the mortgage market, have been pulling their money out of institutions that use short-term borrowing to finance long-term investments.
These institutions aren’t called banks, but in economic terms what’s been happening amounts to a burgeoning banking panic.
On Friday, the Federal Reserve tried to quell this panic by announcing a surprise cut in the discount rate, the rate at which it lends money to banks.
It remains to be seen whether the move will do the trick.
The problem, as many observers have noticed, is that the Fed’s move is largely symbolic.
It makes more funds available to depository institutions, a k a old-fashioned banks — but old-fashioned banks aren’t where the crisis is centered.
And the Fed doesn’t have any clear way to deal with bank runs on institutions that aren’t called banks.
Now, sometimes symbolic gestures are enough.
The Fed’s surprise quarter-point interest rate cut in October 1998, at the height of the crisis caused by the implosion of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, was similarly a case of providing money where it wasn’t needed.

Friday’s cut might do the same thing.
But if it doesn’t, it’s not clear what comes next.
Whatever happens now, it’s hard to avoid the sense that the growing complexity of our financial system is making it increasingly prone to crises — crises that are beyond the ability of traditional policies to handle.
Maybe we’ll make it through this crisis unscathed.
But what about the next one, or the one after that?
“It gives the market a little comfort that it’s not all about buying risk-free securities,” said Scott Wren, equity strategist for A. G. Edwards & Sons.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about four to one on the New York Stock Exchange.
But desperate times call for desperate measures.
While Americans fear an epidemic of foreclosures, brought on by the subprime mortgage meltdown, Britain is already suffering one.

Foreclosures here are at an eight-year high; lenders have repossessed a record 14,000 properties in 2007, 30 percent more than at the same time last year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
An additional 125,100 households are behind in their mortgage payments.
And personal bankruptcies are at an all-time record, caused largely by a crushing increase in mortgage debt.
The situation has grown so dire — as has the threat of desperate homeowners being exploited — that the newly installed government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown is trying to change the fundamentals of the mortgage system.
Whether they can is an open question, especially given Britons’ attachment to home ownership, adjustable-rate mortgages and personal debt.
British consumers are the most indebted citizens of any Group of 7 nation, and television shows devoted to real estate and debt advice are among the most popular programs in the country.

“We live in a society where we encourage people to take on debt, and there is lots of pressure to get your foot on the housing ladder, which has proven quite a fruitful investment for some,” said Frances Walker of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a debt adviser, in London.

Currently, only 5 percent of British home buyers take out fixed-rate mortgages.
The norm here is a mortgage with a fixed rate for the first two years, and then a floating rate for the duration of the mortgage.

But the rate on adjustable mortgages has skyrocketed as the Bank of England ratcheted up interest rates — five times over the last 12 months to 5.75 percent, their highest level since 2001.
Add the rising costs of necessities, like food and utilities, and British homeowners find themselves increasingly squeezed.
Real estate experts here say that is why more and more homeowners are turning to the practice of sale and rent back.
The mushrooming of the unregulated market has worried regulators and lawmakers concerned that homeowners were giving up their houses for as little as 75 percent of market value, with no guarantee they would be allowed to stay in their former property after six months, the minimum lease period here.

Lawmakers are now trying to figure out how to encourage more homeowners to take fixed-rate loans, but that will not help those already facing foreclosure, or prevent the threat of predatory lending.

If there is a silver lining in Britain, it is that, unlike in the United States, home prices are still rising, for now, after more than tripling since 1997.
Recent interest rate increases have yet to reverse the trend.
In fact, the National Housing Federation recently predicted prices would rise 40 percent in the next five years, elevating the average price of a home, which already costs about 11 times the average British salary, to £302,400, or $618,000.

As long as home prices rise, distressed property owners can still sell their home and receive enough money to repay their mortgage debt — in theory.
In reality, selling a property here can take several months, and by the time many owners are facing foreclosure, they often do not have that kind of time.

Higher prices may push some prospective buyers out of the market, but others will simply take out larger mortgages.
Owning a home is so entrenched in the British psyche that most consumers would rather take on additional debt than rent, even if they can’t afford it, say real estate experts.

Some debt advisers have warned that higher demand for borrowing could result in an increase in lax lending practices and plunge more people into personal bankruptcy, which in turn could hurt consumer spending and slow economic growth.
Recognizing that, Mr. Brown’s new government has come up with two initiatives intended to make sure Britain’s housing boom does not turn into a bust.
The measures aim to build 240,000 homes a year by 2016 to provide more affordable housing, and to encourage lenders to sell more 25-year fixed-rate mortgages.

Mortgage experts estimate that about two million mortgages will adjust to a higher rate in the next 18 months as their short-term fixed rates expire.
Longer-term fixed-rate mortgages would limit the risk of such interest rate increases, but short-term thinking among British borrowers and the lack of an established covered-bond market in Britain has kept fixed-rate mortgages from ever taking off here.

The United States mortgage market is financed through capital markets — hence some of the problems currently buffeting the markets — but Britain has always been a retail-led mortgage market, financed through bank savings deposits.

Now Alistair Darling, chancellor of the Exchequer, is studying plans to create a legal framework to allow banks and other lenders to issue covered bonds, and to make them attractive to investors, in order to help lenders create capital pools that would finance longer fixed mortgages.
Yet that task could become markedly more difficult now given the current problems with the United States mortgage market.
“If this deal is ever going to be attractive, now is the time,” Stuart Bernau, Nationwide’s chief executive, said at the time.

Some analysts remain skeptical.
“People don’t feel comfortable tying themselves in for that long, and they get turned off by the penalties” of paying off early, said James Cotton, a mortgage adviser at London & Country Mortgages.
Early payment fees can reach as much as £300,000 in Britain.
But if the government cannot persuade Britons to change their borrowing habits, experts warn that the country may face its own subprime mortgage crisis, as consumers with tarnished credit find that only subprime lenders are willing to work with them.

The problem is fundamental, tied to the imbalance caused by irrationally high home prices and declining optimism that the prices will go higher.
Cutting interest rates will not change this basic situation.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The problem is fundamental because the speculative cycle afflicts much of the world.
Housing booms have not occurred everywhere, but they have been commonplace since the late 1990s in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
We have also seen similar worldwide boom cycles in the stock market over the last 10 or 12 years.
Many countries shared in the huge market booms that peaked in 2000, and just about every major stock market around the world has boomed since 2003.
Classical economics cannot explain this cycle, because underlying these booms is popular reaction to the price increases themselves.
Rising prices encourage investors to expect more price increases, and their optimism feeds back into even more increases, again and again in a vicious circle.
As the boom continues, there is less fear of borrowing heavily, or of lending heavily.
In this situation, lower lending standards seem perfectly appropriate — and even a fair way to permit everyone to prosper.

One might think that investor optimism is generated by rapid world economic growth that is using up scarce resources and driving up asset prices.
Since 2004, the International Monetary Fund’s real per capita growth figures for gross domestic product worldwide have been fairly high: around 4 percent a year.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
It is noteworthy that from 1995 to 2003, when these booms took root, that growth figure averaged only 2.4 percent a year.
A good part of the extra growth since 2004 has probably been the increased spending caused by the speculative booms themselves.
The greatest recent economic successes have apparently been in China and India.
Because these are the most populous countries, together accounting for 37 percent of the world’s population, their success has become an international symbol of spectacular growth.
But it is easy to overstate their importance.
China’s and India’s economies are actually a tiny fraction of world G.D.P.— together only 7 percent.
The popular impressions of suddenly rapid growth are thus mostly a perceptual error, like the optical illusions documented by psychologists.

Democrats say the plight of the estimated two million homeowners who face higher costs because payments on their adjustable-rate mortgages are expected to rise has become a potent political issue.

But the administration says that it is one thing to help people caught between falling home prices and rising interest rates, and another to bail out speculators who find themselves unable to make a quick profit.
This official estimated that of the two million mortgage holders facing new interest rates, 500,000 are at risk of foreclosure because of missed payments.

The reason Fahey has spent his scientific career investigating all manner of starch, carbohydrate and fiber, the reason he has put tubes inside dogs to analyze what they have digested before they have finished digesting it — that reason suddenly became clear: George Fahey has been confronting the myriad challenges of controlling canine bowel movements.
Premium dog foods contain at least 30 percent protein and 20 percent fat, he said.
“Do we need to feed that much?
No.
But this way, you have a total tract digestibility of 88 percent, which is good if you don’t want that dog to go in your house when you’re out for the day.

With his academic status and independent financing, George Fahey’s research spares pet-food manufacturers the negative publicity they might attract if they ran their own experiments on surgically altered dogs.

In the book “The Ralston Brain Regime,” a turn-of-the-century human-diet guru named Webster Edgerly presented “a course of conduct, exercises and study designed to develop perfect health in the physical brain.” The name Ralston was itself an acronym of Edgerly’s seven life principles: Regime, Activity, Light, Strength, Temperation, Oxygen and Nature.
Despite the emphasis on health, food for animals has long been prone to potentially lethal adulteration.
“The animal behaves in a thoroughly panic-stricken manner,” noted a report by Food and Drug Administration scientists in 1948, “throwing itself against the sides of the cage, clawing the air and howling piteously.
If unconfined, it will run wildly about bumping into all objects in its path.” In acute cases the disease culminated in convulsions and death, and the culprit turned out to be a chemical wheat-bleaching agent used in processing flour.

Notwithstanding such occasional defilements, research into pet food and human food continued to follow parallel paths.
When the marketing meetings began, Purina executives decided that instead of distributing the product to the company’s nationwide web of feed stores, this new pet food, code-named X-24, would go to supermarkets, where it could be bought and sold next to human groceries.

The vast majority of America’s 75 million dogs and 88 million cats continue to feed on scraps from the human food industry’s table: pet-food ingredients like ground chicken bones, pig blood and distillers byproducts.
Indeed, when an agriculture-processing company encounters an industrial leftover — corn fiber, let’s say, from its production of ethanol — it might put in a call to George Fahey’s lab.
Fahey has done a great deal of work with corn fiber and is exploring its potential as a source of fiber in the canine diet.
Although pet nutrition has generally followed trends in human nutrition, sometimes that order has been reversed.
“We will see corn fiber in human foods like cereals and snacks,” Fahey told me.
“There’s no reason that it should not be able to be used.” Such adaptations have occurred before.
A major manufacturer of baked goods for humans, he said, picked up on the idea of using hydrogen-peroxide-treated fiber and experimented with mixing the substance into some of its breads.

Experiments with cats and dogs have long been used as a key to the scientific mysteries of the human diet.
For obvious reasons, scientists cannot test human digestion by delivering experimental meals that lack vital nutriments.
Dogs, however, have metabolism similar to ours, they are widely available and their internal organs are larger than those of rats, which makes them well suited to examination.
Paradoxically, the same nutrition experiments that caused disease or death have led to pioneering advances in animal health care.
Because nutritional biochemists have measured almost everything about the canine and feline diets — from energy densities to intestinal transit times — they know what to do when something goes wrong.
The latest word in digestibility studies may have cost lab animals a score of nasty symptoms, but the data gathered will help save many sick pets down the road.
Today the hospital treats more than 25,000 small animals every year, and the nutrition center does much of its work on the clinical frontier where sustenance meets medication.
“We have not seen N.I.H.

“The clinical nutrition program will spread across the country,” Osburn predicted.
Some of his confidence was surely an administrator’s pride in his university, but it didn’t seem like a stretch to imagine that the nutritional products and procedures developed here — including cancer-care diets and high-fat regimens for anorectic pets — could soon become successful on the mass market.
Dogs and cats are living longer and growing fatter and more dyspeptic, and, like their owners, they have to watch the calories.
Today, as geneticists close in on the cat genome, researchers and pet-food marketers are rushing to find ways to make high-end pet diets even more customized.
“This is part of a larger trend in nutrition: complexity and individualization,” says Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.
“In the future someone is likely to do a genetic profile of your animal and prescribe accordingly.
How accurate or useful this will be is an open question.” Genome-based animal feed may evolve into the ultimate personalized diet for pets, or it may meet the same fate as the unsuccessful collaboration by Carnation and Upjohn in 1985 to market birth-control dog food.

Professor Nestle perceives two tracks for the future feeding of America’s cats and dogs, tracks that parallel the nutrition trends of their owners: The wealthiest 5 to 8 percent of pet owners, those with college educations, annual household incomes in excess of $70,000 and an expanding human diet of organic, locally grown and luxury food products, will provide ever better, fresher and more delicious food for their pets.
The other 92 to 95 percent of pets compose a second track that will consume increasingly industrialized diets.
Even today these diets commonly consist of byproducts cooked into sterile and viscous masses, sheared into the simulacrum of a bone or a patty, and then, according to a report by the National Research Council in Washington, spray-dried with minuscule beadlets of fat, protein and calibrated savor.
Kind of like the industrial, increasingly synthetic and processed diets of their owners.

Nestle’s research for her next book, “What Pets Eat,” has also brought to her attention the enormous numbers of emerging pet-food companies.
(“I just met with this guy in Colorado who’s doing a high-end bison pet food,” she says.)
As these pet-food start-ups edge their way into the market, many entrepreneurs appear to have concluded that there must be a way to feed dogs and cats without relying on the rendering industry, the surgical procedures of academic research or the detritus of alternative-fuel manufacturing.
They have begun to speak of a pet-food revolution.
According to Nestle, the push to reform pet food is part of the broader movement to transform the way human beings eat.
The pet-food movement “is grass roots, and it is a combination of the so-called good, clean, fair movement, the slow-food movement, the locally grown movement and the farm-animal welfare movement.
These social movements are about changing the industrialized food system,” she says.
The latest trends in pet food emphasize not only natural and organic ingredients but also an increased obligation to identify the precise origins of those ingredients.
Nestle says, “This will place enormous pressure on standard industrialized pet-food companies to say where their stuff comes from.”

Righteous Dog Food retails for $7.50 a pound, compared with around $1 a pound for an inexpensive commercial brand.
Gowdy and Outlaw envision a time when they will sell 12,000 pounds of food each month in the New York metropolitan area, enough to feed 600 dogs — and to make a profit.
For now, demand has outstripped the capacity of Gowdy’s General Electric range, so the partners have begun to prepare their products at an industrial kitchen called Hudson Valley Foodworks, in upstate New York.
A company manufacturing dog biscuits, which, like Righteous Dog Food, only uses human-grade ingredients, has also joined the roster.
On the sweltering morning the partners invited me to visit their operation, Gowdy and Outlaw planned on cooking two 500-pound batches of a chicken recipe and one 500-pound batch of beef-based fare.

“It’s probably too healthy for me,” he said.
If you are what you eat, is it also true that you are what your pet eats?
Tim Phillips, the editor of Petfood Industry magazine, says that animal owners tend to think so, and even more often they tend to think, This is what I like, so my dog or cat must like the same things.
If a cat owner wants takeout, her cat can have takeout, too; if she watches TV while she dines, her cat can have its own TV dinner.

Whether religion, science or business, pet food is booming.
Today about a third of the animal-science graduate students studying at the University of Illinois with George Fahey and other professors devote themselves to nutrition, and according to Fahey the industry brims with job opportunities for them.
“It’s as good a time as ever in the 30 years I’ve been doing this,” he told me.
“This is a very secure building,” he said.

The plugs did not seem to irritate the dogs.
“If it is put in correctly, it becomes part of them,” he said.
“It heals very nicely, and becomes a part of their anatomy.” The ports must be opened and inspected at least once a week and flushed at least once a month, and when Fahey or his colleagues collect samples they simply unplug a stopper, attach a plastic bag and let the dogs run around, which pushes out the digesta.
Clearly, they were begging, but begging for what?
But the Fed’s main weapon for restoring confidence — reducing its benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks to 5 percent or less, from 5.25 percent now — would have little effect on fears about credit quality.

“The reason there isn’t a market for these credits is that people don’t know what price they should be trading at,” said Edward E.

“It would be a very powerful signal,” said Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Citigroup.
“A critical determinant of housing prices is employment.
If you think employment is going to weaken, your assumption for housing and for the ripple effects through the economy will be very different.”
But economists are still debating whether the Fed created the housing bubble, and thus set the stage for the current bust, when it slashed interest rates to cushion the shock of a bursting stock market bubble.

“It’s too easy to blame the Fed,” said Robert J. Shiller of Yale, who sounded early alarms about both the stock market and housing bubbles.
Mr. Shiller blamed mass psychology for the bubble, an almost ubiquitous conviction that housing prices would simply keep climbing at double-digit rates.
Fed officials have long cringed at the idea of a “Greenspan put,” the idea that former chairman Alan Greenspan could be counted on to rescue financial markets in times of turmoil by cutting rates.

Mr. Bernanke also made it clear he now worries that the downturn in housing and mortgage lending could pose a danger to the broader economy.

“Housing prices should not have a special role in the conduct of monetary policy,” said Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, in a speech at the Jackson Hole conference.
“On the other hand, central banks should be actively prepared to deal with situations as they arise.
You want to be prepared.”
Reducing the fed funds rate would not necessarily rescue people who took on far more debt than they could afford.
Rather, Fed officials appear to hope that the move would stimulate consumption and send a reassuring signal to investors that the Fed is prepared to prevent a full recession.

But the last few years suggest that the overnight fed funds rate has a weak relationship to housing.
Long-term interest rates, which determine mortgage rates, rose slightly before the central bank began raising the overnight rate in June 2004.

But given the collapse of confidence in the credit quality for subprime and near-prime mortgages, which accounted for about one-quarter of mortgage originations as recently as May, few forecasters expect a quick recovery — and certainly not because of a slightly lower overnight lending rate.
In Thursday’s paper, David Pogue reviews the movies-on-demand set-top box service, Vudu.
The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., will start selling its movie box at the end of the month for $399.
The shiny black device plugs into your television and to a high speed internet connection.
Then you rent or buy from a roster of thousands of movies, and start watching any one of them instantly.
The blundit argument has since gotten some corroborating evidence as Apple TV has largely failed to move the market, an unusual misfire for Steve Jobs.
So are Vudu and other set-top-box startups dead on arrival?
I’ll answer the question with another one: Are you satisfied with the television box, and its on-demand services, currently in your home?
I think the blundits underestimate the mounting dissatisfaction with the services being provided by cable and satellite companies.
Many of today’s set-tops are almost famously awful, with poorly designed user interfaces, weakly cloned DVRs, over-worked central processors and confusing remote controls.
For example, get people talking about the Comcast HD DVR box — as John Battelle did here — and you unlock a wave of venom.
People are fed up with the hardware in their living room, particularly as the Internet elevates their expectations for consuming media.
But no one—not even Apple— has yet figured out a way to profit from that unhappiness.
Maybe it will be Vudu.
Maybe it will be the yet to launch Building B, or any of the other Silicon Valley startups that see a market where the blundits see blind alleys.
I have tested the Vudu device for the last week too, and even though my DSL Internet connection is slower than recommended for the service, I have found it to be an absolute pleasure to use.
As the movie selection grows, I can even foresee ditching my Netflix subscription – and finally getting rid of that nasty case of Netflix Guilt.
And getting rid of my Comcast HD DVR box altogether?
I’m just waiting for a good reason.

The final bill, hammered out this week in a House-Senate conference committee, alters many of the ground rules for financing higher education, offering forgiveness on student loans to graduates who work for 10 years or more in public service professions like teaching, firefighting and the police, and limiting monthly payments on federally backed loans to 15 percent of the borrower’s discretionary income.

It also raises the maximum Pell grant, the basic federal grant for middle- and low-income students, to $5,400 from the current $4,310 over the next five years.
To pay for the changes, the bill reduces federal subsidies to lenders by roughly $20 billion over the same period.
“Today we’ll need a similar bold new commitment to enable the current generation of Americans to rise to the global challenges we face,” said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the education committee.
“Today we’ll help millions of students achieve the American dream.”
Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House education committee, said that last year, Republicans took nearly $12 billion from federal student aid programs.
“That’s the difference that an election makes.”

Campaign promises aside, the changes reflect the steep and sudden decline in the fortunes of the $85 billion student loan industry after years of generous subsidies and support in Congress.

Lenders, which had campaigned hard against the subsidy cuts, warned that the reductions would compromise the federal loan program, forcing some of them out of business and reducing competition and, inevitably, services to students.

Kevin Bruns, executive director of America’s Student Loan Providers, said the legislation “punishes the industry,” while Joe Belew, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said it would “come to be viewed as irresponsible legislation that undermined rather than expanded college opportunity.”
Mr. Kennedy dismissed the complaints, saying, “The reality is that our bill restores the balance to this grossly unfair student loan system by directing funds to the students, not to the banks.”
House Republicans, some of whom had received generous campaign contributions from lenders in the past, derided parts of the legislation — particularly the forgiveness of loans for certain professions — as a form of socialism.

Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and a former chairman of the education committee, predicted that the subsidy reductions “will cripple the private sector loan program,” which he credited with bringing “lots of innovation” to students and parents.
“This legislation does nothing at all to reduce the cost of college,” Mr. McKeon said.
“I don’t know how we can treat banks as credible arbiters of what appropriate subsidies should be.”
With the law, Congress is reducing federal subsidies to lenders by roughly $20 billion and gradually halving the interest rate on need-based student loans over the next four years.
Some $11.4 billion of that money will go toward increasing Pell grants.

For the first time, the government will now auction off the right to offer federally backed educational loans to parents state by state, instead of setting the rate from Washington.
The two lowest bidders in each state will win the right to make subsidized college loans to parents.
It is true that a more liquid short-term loan market can give a highly leveraged institution a second chance.
An immediate infusion of cash can be a lifeline for a solvent, but illiquid, company.
But keeping loan markets open is not a bailout; it’s simply getting part of the economic infrastructure back on line, much as the police clear a road after a traffic accident.
Note that when the Fed makes it easier for financial institutions to borrow money, the loan must still be repaid.

Colorful interpretations of recent monetary policy abound, from both commentators and politicians.
Depending on the storyteller, the policy reflects the triumph of the rich over the poor, an atonement for the sins of the Bush administration, a long-awaited comeuppance for the American economy, a continuing hangover from the dot-com bubble, or an inability of the professor (Ben S. Bernanke) to handle a real-world job (running the Fed).
Journalists are especially likely to embrace narratives, if only because their editors and their readers clamor for them.
Of course, if there are enough competing stories, some of them will fit or predict some real-world events, if only because of random luck.
Nonetheless, Fed watchers should resist the tendency to put all events into a simple or a morally plausible narrative.
Monetary policy is a largely technical subject, and its ups and downs don’t usually fit into the kinds of emotion-laden stories that human beings apply to daily life.
The “us versus them” tag registers in human memory, but monetary policy is not always or even usually about moral issues.

In response to this crisis, the Fed has been trying to keep a steady hand and prevent a credit crunch.

Of course, such an account of recent financial history sounds mundane and offers less human conflict.

Debating Fed policy in terms of strong moral narratives makes it harder for the Fed to do a good job.
For instance, if interest-rate cuts are portrayed as a bailout for hedge fund managers, it’s harder for the Fed to cut interest rates, if that turns out to be the appropriate policy.
It also makes the public wonder — unjustifiably — who else might deserve a subsidy as well.
Both President Bush and Congress are preparing plans to assist homeowners facing foreclosure.
Many of these proposals are political pandering, designed to win votes by easing the pain of homeowners.
Yet someone else is paying the bill, so protecting people from their mistakes in this way does not promote the general public welfare.
In any case, these proposals should be evaluated on their (often slight) merits, rather than seen as a quid pro quo for another bailout already made.
THE American public has a hard-enough time understanding relatively simple economic issues like the benefits of free trade, much less the Fed or monetary policy.
So if the picture sticks that the Fed is a shill for hedge fund managers, or that it is treating homeowners unfairly, the pressure will mount for Congress to limit the Fed’s independence.
Yet most economists, on a bipartisan basis, agree that relatively independent central banks have a better record of maintaining economic stability and keeping down price inflation.
Wealthy financiers and hedge funds make for easy targets, especially when combined with the arcane field of central banking.
But the real moral question is whether we will prove mentally tough enough.
Can we resist the temptation to force financial markets and the Fed into oversimplified moral narratives?
Or will we continue to blame Zeus for lightning strikes?

The question of our mental strength and discipline is also a story — and I hope it has a happy ending.
“Bernanke didn’t really say anything about interest rates, but at this point the feeling on Wall Street is that it’s mandatory,” said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist of Weeden & Company, speaking about a rate cut.
“At this point, the market is pricing in not just one rate cut, but a couple, and that’s helping to stabilize stocks.”

Following are the results of yesterday’s auction of four-week Treasury bills:
The European Central Bank, which initiated the effort on Aug. 9, has added 250 billion euros ($348 billion) to the market, and yesterday it continued its effort by lending 75 billion euros ($104 billion) for three months.
The Federal Reserve and the Japanese central bank have also added liquidity, and on Aug. 17 the Fed cut the rate at which it lends money directly to banks by a half-point.

But the Bank of England has taken only a modest part in this effort, injecting £4.4 billion ($8.9 billion) into the system since the crisis began a month ago.
Instead, it has reminded banks that they can always borrow at a “penalty rate” of one percentage point above a benchmark rate that is now 5.25 percent — a pointed message that those who speculate and lose have to pay some price.
The British bank might be expected to be among the most concerned about the credit crisis because the British economy — and particularly greater London — depends heavily on a financial services industry that is now at the center of the storm.

But some analysts maintain that the bank is relying on measures taken in the United States and at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.
To the extent that British banks need pounds sterling, this view has it, they can simply borrow in dollars or euros and convert them, freeing the Bank of England from the task and allowing it to occupy the moral high ground.

And since most of the mortgage-backed securities are denominated in dollars, the need to borrow in pounds will be limited, analysts said.
Still, Mr. King has turned into the most prominent critic of those in the financial markets who have been clamoring for cheap money.
Such market participants see more liquidity as the solution for investors who borrowed heavily to buy the securities that have lost value.
But Mr. King’s fear is that cheap money will encourage investors to create anew the kind of financial house of cards that is now tumbling down.

To be sure, buying furniture can be fraught with pitfalls, including financing and delivery.
“Shopping for furniture is treacherous,” James Hood, editor of ConsumerAffairs.com, wrote in an e-mail message.
“The only 100 percent sure way to get what you pay for is to buy the items you want off the floor, load them into your truck or van and take them home with you.”

With a little planning, consumers can minimize the potential for bad outcomes by following the advice of the specialists:
RESEARCH Approach furniture buying as you would car buying, Mr. Lewin said.
Research brands and retailers, and examine rankings and quality reports.
Do your homework on the Internet, but don’t necessarily buy there.
If you do, he said, pay with a credit card and make sure you understand the return policy.
ROOM PLANS Raymour & Flanigan and other retailers now offer online room planning tools on their Web sites (raymourflanigan.com).

After registering at the retailer’s site, buyers can save their designs, e-mail them and go to the store and change the plan on a store computer once they see the furniture.
“Design and fit are the major questions they need answered before they buy the product,” Mr. Street said.
Icovia is also working with property managers.

STORE VISIT The biggest mistake people make is they don’t really test how well the item sits, Mr. Lewin, the author, said.
If it’s a couch or chair, sit on it for as long as you can, he said.
“Everybody is in a hurry, but hold off ordering until you can come back and see if it feels good.”
Come prepared with measurements.
“When you’re out spending thousands of dollars, you should have a plan with precise schematics and dimensions,” he said, both square feet and cubic feet to account for higher ceilings.

Don’t just look at the furniture, he said, “heft it,” pick up an arm to see if it’s heavy.
Lighter-weight material might be of lesser quality.
Look at the pattern match.
If the item is a table or dresser made of wood, examine the finish.
Check the drawers and the back panels.
If it has cardboard components, quality may be an issue.

What you see in the showroom may not be what you get, Mr.
To avoid this, he writes, find a furniture warehouse, outlet or resale center that stocks the kind of furniture you want.
“Many of these are open only on weekends.
It might sound silly, but it’s the surest way of getting what you want, and, if you’re careful, can be the most economical way of getting good quality furniture.”
DELIVERY Heeding Mr. Hood’s advice means no problems on the receiving end.
Many consumers write to ConsumerAffairs.com to relate delivery nightmares, he said.

“Delivery problems are horrendous and getting worse,” he writes.
“Deliveries are often late, the crews are often ill-trained, rude and incompetent — and sometimes larcenous.
The furniture that is delivered may not be what you ordered, it may be damaged or it may not fit through the door.

“If any of these occurs, it’s just the beginning of a long series of frustrating conversations with customer service,” he said.
LAYAWAYS AND FINANCING Many stores still offer layaway plans, which allow you to pay off the furniture before it is delivered.
Retailers also have many buy-now, pay-later financing arrangements that are tailored to a consumer’s credit history and financial standing.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Pay cash or use a credit card, Mr. Wood said.
“Layaway or other store-based financing is almost always a mistake.
It’s a good way to lose all of your money, in the case of layaway,” when a furniture store declares bankruptcy or goes out of business.
Financing plans often cost more than consumers expect, he added.
Just like car dealers, retailers lure buyers with no-interest financing over longer periods.
At Raymour & Flanigan, buyers who qualify can finance $1,000 a year, interest free, for up to four years.
Borrowers must make monthly payments, and there is no prepayment penalty.
Still, experts say, if consumers miss a payment on these finance plans or fail to pay off the balance on the due date, they are often hit with double-digit interest rate charges that some stores back-date to the time of purchase.
It is a personal choice, Mr. Lewin says, but still consumers should recognize that they are changing rooms much more frequently today — every couple of years instead of every decade.
If consumers are buying now and paying later, they may need to get rid of the furniture before it is paid off, because of lifestyle changes.
“The smart shopper spends what they can afford.
And there are more lodgings to come.
The most ambitious is a 102-room complex being built just off the road to the town of Novo Airão by the Accor group of France, which is scheduled to open in 2010 and will be the first international luxury chain hotel actually in the jungle; the Hilton company has also announced plans to build a 196-room “eco-lodge resort” near Novo Airão .

For the moment, however, the Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge, which opened in February, is the newest and perhaps the most chic example of the lodge phenomenon.
Operated by a couple from São Paulo, it is on a bluff above the Rio Negro, within sight of the Anavilhanas Ecological Station, a government nature reserve that encompasses the world's largest riverine archipelago, with more than 400 islands and hundreds of lakes and igapós, an indigenous word that means flood forest.
Astonishingly rich in both animal and plant life, the reserve area, which has been designated a Unesco World Heritage site, is unspoiled and uninhabited.
No matter what their location, the lodges tend to follow a certain pattern when it comes to outings.
In the morning, for instance, before the heat gets too stifling, a nature walk is, more often than not, de rigueur; I've seen all sorts of monkeys, macaws and toucans, not to mention sloths and anteaters, on such treks.
Afternoon excursions to fish for piranha provide the kind of bragging rights that delighted my teenage son when I took him with me on an Amazon trip a few years ago.
After dinner, it's often back to the boat to hunt for the Amazonian caiman known as the jacaré.
But instead of carrying guns or spears, guides are armed with powerful spotlights that freeze the reptiles in position and make it possible to remove young ones from the water so that guests can run their hands over their cool, ridged carapaces.

All can arrange an excursion for you to witness the “meeting of the waters,” the spot just southeast of Manaus where the Rio Negro's dark waters converge with those of the Amazon's other major tributary, the Solimões.
I've stopped there at least a dozen times and never cease to be amazed at the way the two great rivers, markedly different in color and temperature, collide with such force and volume that they seem to be fighting each other.

But each lodge also tries to offer something its competitors do not.
For instance, the Amazon Ecopark Jungle Lodge, 40 minutes from Manaus, is famous for its “Monkey Jungle Reserve.” Here, woolly monkeys, some confiscated from contraband dealers, others injured, are monitored at a rehabilitation center on the lodge grounds.

At the Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge, a group of more than a dozen botos, or gray dolphins, show up daily to be fed at nearby Novo Airão.
A motorboat from the lodge takes guests to a floating restaurant alongside the main dock there, where a pet anaconda circulates among customers sipping chilled beers or soft drinks.
As we stood on a raft attached to the restaurant, the dolphins cavorted, sticking their long snouts up from the water for pieces of fish tossed their way or seizing fish snacks from tourists intrepid enough to go into the water.
“If we'd let the botos, they would spend the entire day here, just eating,” said Marisa Grangeiro de Almeida, whose family operates the restaurant.
“But the environmental agency and the university scientists have established fixed feeding hours.”
The Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge has its own strict rules when it comes to the guides it employs.
Most lodges rely on freelancers who come in from Manaus.
The Anavilhanas lodge hires only residents, which quickly pays off for the visitor.

That is important because the sheer abundance of wildlife on view can be staggering, especially as one gets farther away from Manaus.
I have never seen as many birds, for example, as I did two years ago at the Pousada Uacari, which is situated inside the Mamirauá nature reserve, 350 miles west of Manaus at the confluence of the Solimões and Japurá Rivers.

Like several of the new lodges in the region, the Pousada Uacari is not on land, but sits on floating rafts at a bend in the river.
Here guests can view wildlife in remarkable proximity.
After dark, for instance, I could see caimans, some as large as eight feet, their eyes glowing like orange lanterns; some came startlingly close, banging against the dock and making querulous grunts, a symphony that continued through the night.
There is even a lodge that is literally up in the trees.
One of the oldest and by far the largest of the jungle lodges, it has been visited by celebrities like Bill Gates and the King and Queen of Spain.
All 269 rooms are up in the jungle canopy, as much as 60 feet above the river, and connected to one another and the dining hall and common areas via aerial walkways.

Only one lodge that I know of can claim to be on the Amazon River itself.
The Amazon Riverside Hotel makes the most of that distinction, offering excursions to see the sun rise from a century-old British-built navigation beacon in the middle of the river; it also has a nature trail that leads to a hilltop observation post with a commanding view of both the jungle and the river, and has arranged hammocks at the dock for guests keen on doing nothing but watching the river flow.
Just to remind guests where they are, the Amazon Riverside's reception area, built around a lagoon, displays the outsize skulls of an adult caiman and a toothy onça, the Brazilian cougar.
Lined up near the dining area is a series of jars with pickled remains of some of the animals that have been found on or near the hotel grounds: poisonous snakes, scorpions and spiders, including a giant caranguejeira, or crab spider.

The owners of the Amazon Riverside are members of Manaus's flourishing Japanese community, which migrated to the region nearly a century ago to work on jute and pepper plantations.
The Tsuji family caters to Japanese tourists, an effort that is reflected in an innovative menu that includes dishes such as sashimi of tambaqui, a prized Amazon game fish, and tempura made with okra and abóbora, the Brazilian equivalent of pumpkin.

The piranha fishing there was extraordinary.
Many lodges organize visits to the homes of people who live nearby, at the river's edge in houses usually on stilts.
Known in Portuguese either as caboclos, a term equivalent to hillbilly, or more respectfully as ribeirinhos, or river dwellers, they have limited incomes and little contact with the rest of Brazil.

To the river dwellers all visitors seem impossibly well-off.
But luxury, of course, is a relative concept.
The reality is that it is tremendously difficult and expensive to bring in fuel, food and other supplies by boat, and no Amazon lodge I've visited would ever qualify as a five-star resort.

VISITOR INFORMATION
HOW TO GET THERE
Until mid-2006, getting to Manaus from the United States was a cumbersome process that often involved flying to Rio or São Paulo and then doubling back.
But Brazil's TAM Airlines (www.tam.com.br) now operates a daily five-hour flight from Miami.
A round trip in late September or October starts at $1,025; Copa Airlines (www.copaair.com) also has flights from $969, but those include a stop in Panama.

WHERE TO STAY
The packages mentioned are per person and include three meals a day.
Except as noted, transportation from and back to Manaus is also covered.
The Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge (55-92-3622-8996; www.anavilhanaslodge.com) has been open for only about six months, and is perhaps the most elegant lodging in the Amazon.
It has 16 air-conditioned, wood-paneled rooms decorated with regional art, and an open-air common area stocked with DVDs and books.
The minimum two-night package is 950 reals total, or $475 at 2 reals to the dollar.

Unlike most other new lodges, the Amazon Riverside Hotel (55-92-3622-2789; www.amazonriversidehotel.com), which opened in 2002, is 40 minutes downstream from Manaus, not upstream.
As a result, transportation to the hotel includes a visit to the site where the Rio Negro and the Solimões join to form the Amazon.
There are 15 rustic apartments, with fans but no air-conditioning.
The one-night package is 625 reals; the hotel also offers a day-use option for 250 reals.
The main lure of the Pousada Uacari (97-3343-4160; www.uakarilodge.com.br) is its privileged location, in the Mamirauá nature reserve about 90 minutes by speedboat from Tefé, which is on the banks of the Solimões River.
There are 5 floating wood cabins, offering a total of 10 rustic apartments, with water for the showers and sinks coming directly from the river.
The minimum three-night package of 1,000 reals a person does not include transportation from Manaus to Tefé.
In a competition for most unusual setting, the Ariaú Amazon Towers (55-92-2121-5000; www.ariau.tur.br) would win hands down.
Just off the west bank of the Rio Negro, its 269 rooms, some with air-conditioning, and trees growing through them, are up at the level where monkeys live.

Less than an hour from Manaus by boat, the Amazon Ecopark Jungle Lodge (55-21-2256-8083; www.amazonecopark.com.br) has 64 rooms and 3 bungalows, a beach on the Rio Negro and a pool.
At 11 a.m. and 5 p.m., there are opportunities to feed the monkeys.
One night is 720 reals.
WHEN TO GO
“In September, October and November, the water levels are quite low,” said Wedson Franklin Santos, a guide who works at the Amazon Riverside Hotel, “so you get to see all the exuberance of the wildlife,” which is forced out into the open.
He added that during the middle of the year, when the flood plain is starting to recede, “the attraction is more the landscape itself and not the animals, which are mostly in hiding.”
STAYING HEALTHY
Most doctors recommend a program of antimalarial medicine, beginning several weeks before arrival and continuing during a trip.
(I stopped taking such prophylactics because of the unpleasant side effects, and besides, there is now a drug-resistant strain of malaria.)
But there are other measures one can adopt to reduce the risk of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue.
Rather than going outdoors with arms exposed, for example, wear a long-sleeve shirt made from a lightweight fabric.
And do your best to avoid being outside during the period local people call “the malaria hour,” about 5 to 7 p.m.
And whether home prices begin falling noticeably or merely stagnate for years until incomes catch up, it’s clear that the real estate bust has become the dominant force in the economy.

Earlier this year, Robert J. Barbera, who’s been a Wall Street economist for 25 years, was predicting a soft landing for housing — that is, stagnation rather than substantial declines.
“But now it appears that’s not the way we’re going to do it,” says Mr. Barbera, the chief economist at ITG Hoenig, who correctly predicted yesterday’s Fed move.
What has changed in recent weeks are the spike in mortgage rates, the drying up of subprime lending and the ever-growing number of houses on the market.
It’s also worth looking at what happened to home sales last month in California, where counties release property transaction records earlier than they do in most of the rest of the country.
In the Los Angeles area, 35 percent fewer homes sold this August than in August 2006, according to an analysis by DataQuick Information Systems.

The exact path that housing prices will take over the next few years is, obviously, unknowable.
But there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that the typical home last year was overvalued by something like 20 percent.
I wouldn’t necessarily argue with anyone who insisted on 15 or 25 percent.

The reason it may not be bigger is that mortgage rates remain a good bit lower than they were for much of the last generation.
But they’re not so different as to suggest that home prices have returned to rational levels.

The scariest part of a national decline like this is that it could be more like 40 percent in some parts of the country.
That’s difficult to fathom — and, in fact, construction would probably come to a halt in those places, cushioning the price drop locally and, by extension, a bit nationally.
But 40 percent is not out of the question in a few places, like the southwestern coast of Florida.
Remember that all of these declines are relative to income or inflation.
The median house price nationwide has already started falling since last year, according to the S.& P./Case-Shiller Index, the most accurate measure.
If actual prices were to fall 10 percent over the next year or so and then do nothing for the following five years, that would add up to about a 20 percent decline, adjusted for inflation.
This would be a big deal.
It would lead to lost jobs, less consumer spending and slower economic growth.
It would be the worst housing downturn on record.
It’s hard not to notice that the latest round of grim news has come in the same week that Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke’s predecessor at the Fed, is making the rounds of talk shows to promote his new memoir.
Mr. Greenspan has long defended his inaction during the housing boom, particularly his decision not to crack down on out-of-control mortgage lending, by saying that bubbles are extremely difficult to recognize until after the fact.

I don’t know, though.
This one didn’t seem so subtle.
Now Mr. Bernanke has to deal with its aftermath.
So do the rest of us.
Analysts said a decline in the cost of goods used to make other goods, known as intermediate goods, signaled that price increases were slowing further up the production chain and that consumers might see some relief as those goods are processed and enter the retail market.
Together, the reports suggest to some analysts that inflation worries will not stand in the way of future rate cuts.
The Dow Jones industrial average, keeping pace with its 335-point gain from yesterday, was up 94.05 points, or 0.7 percent.

Still, the threat of inflation has not dissipated, with some analysts pointing to the 0.2 percent increase in core consumer prices and a similar gain in the core Producer Price Index.

“I think it’s a bit of a mistake to assume that the inflation genie has been put back in the bottle,” said Michael T. Darda, chief economist for MKM Partners, a research firm based in Greenwich, Conn.. Mr. Darda argued that this month’s plunge in oil and energy costs have skewed inflation figures, providing a falsely reassuring snapshot of the current retail market.

But other observers saw this morning’s report as a sign of stabilization.
“There is no clear sign of deceleration in the core,” said Per Gunnar Berglund, a senior economist at Moody’s Economy.com.
“We expect it to stabilize around 2 percent going forward.” Referring to personal consumption expenditures, another inflation gauge, he added, “Our take is that the core P.C.E.
price will decelerate somewhat further in the coming months and that the core C.P.I.
will remain where it is.”
Restrained inflation could help ease the effect of the turmoil in the housing and credit markets on the broader economy.
While the fallout has been relatively modest so far, some consumers are becoming more cautious.
Whether that leads to a modest economic slowdown or a full-blown recession will depend on several variables, primarily employment and consumer spending.

Consumer spending was aided by the housing boom, especially in states like California, Florida, Arizona and New York, but there are few signs that the ensuing housing slump will abate soon.
Those figures fell short of analysts’ expectations.

Her husband, Jess Lynn, a former stage manager whom she met in college and married in 1990, once told her, “You’re like the opposite of Dorothy Parker, where you love writing and hate having written.”

The play is about two half sisters who inherit a possibly valuable stamp collection and the three male philatelists who want to get their hands on it.
“The stamps mean something desperate to all of them,” Ms. Rebeck said.
“In some ways the stamps mean life to them.
I’m a believer that all of us are broken in some way, and there’s a hole in our heart that we pour our own destruction or our children or our stamp collection into.“

Ms. Rebeck seems to share with her protagonists a strong sense of right and wrong.
Her characters frequently pay for their principles.
“The Family of Mann,” a comedy she has sometimes called a “documentary,” is largely an exposé of the wounds she suffered in the trenches of television writing, with which she has extensive experience.
While she still writes the occasional pilot, she said she’s substantially absented herself from that world, calling it “a bit crackers for someone like me”
There are plenty of tales of Hollywood in “Free Fire Zone,” her recently published “writer’s guide” to working in film, television and theater.
In it she relates, with comic aplomb and barely concealed fury, a few dozen terrifying war stories from her nearly 20 years in the business.
She censors herself only to the extent of renaming figures with names like Caligula, Napoleon, Richard III and Satan.

Ms. Rebeck said she wrote the book as a “don’t kid yourself” answer to the many young writers who ask her for advice.
But the tone of the book matches her plays, the simultaneous search and demand for values and decency.
“I think Theresa’s plays are about how to behave morally in today’s world,” said Will Frears, who directed the New York productions of “Omnium” and “The Water’s Edge.” “How is that possible?”
Ms. Rebeck herself put it more simply: “I don’t ever write about an amoral universe.” That, apparently, would not be interesting.
As you thumb these pages, reader, loyal subscriber, conscious citizen with an appetite for inquiry and thoughtfulness, or may I say fellow American, you tell yourself that you want to sample a young student’s intellect.
Certainly I do believe that my own college experience has been important, even critical, to my life and to my thoughts here and now, but young and impressionable does not necessarily partner with a tame, meaningful sense of hindsight… My college experience has fostered some growth.
But for the nation?
Lend me some relevance.
Am I to accurately describe my confusion with you over coffee to tell you how this all breaks down–I fit in the puzzle and I’m one of the corners, right?
Politics.
We don’t have movements, and we don’t have causes.
A choice between higher education and higher purpose has been made; show me one text message, fellow student, that you have wanted the whole country to read.
Children live at school.
Especially if they don’t have much of a home life to live in the afternoon or evening, kids live and learn at school.
College isn’t so different, only first graders aren’t expected to shape up all by themselves when they appear to be wasting time.
Oh, college students aren’t either?
Pity.
I guess higher education isn’t all that important.
Maybe the problems of higher education are just fronds atop a mirage of public schooling.
Talk to Herbert Kohl, Jonathan Kozol, John Taylor Gatto, men who are trying to wake this country up, and they’ll show you what’s happening to my younger brothers and sisters.
Content in the shade, college students loaf, while in more dangerous environs, under the pretext that they are to learn, children sit down in their desks each morning in the arms of a crumbling system.
In college, we choose to sleep in, not to participate, excel, regress, etc.
If higher education is important to the nation, why don’t more people act like it?
Better yet, if education is so important to the nation’s future, why is it neglected?
Important as it is, I feel proud to remember the words of Thomas Jefferson, who often can remind us of politicians’ and citizens’ true responsibilities: “It is highly interesting to our country, and it is the duty of its functionaries, to provide that every citizen in it should receive an education proportioned to the condition and pursuits of his life.” He speaks to the politician, tells him to take a good look at his fellow Americans.
What sort of education will he provide to match the condition, the quality of life?
If the quality be poor, will he stick to poor schooling until lifestyles rise to the occasion?
Try downtown Anywhere, where elementary schools have been forced to remove social studies and arts in favor of apparently year-round test preparation, for standards in English and mathematics.
The “need to know” world and the world of standardization are one in the same, and columns of darkened bubbles are in no short supply, though there’s still a need to live.
Speaking of letters and numbers now, I can admit to the usefulness of text messaging, at least as a pursuit of happiness.
Last I checked, the pursuit of happiness is a right, along with life and liberty, all-redeeming, not measurable in proportion, because it is a right.
So let’s point happiness in the right direction, because happiness can come quickly to college students.
Given the privilege of a college experience, the high school graduate will face a myriad of choices, many that will contribute to a direction in life, maybe the chance to make a difference.
I readily despise the would-be friends who, at the mention of “making a difference,” or “doing some good in the world,” pack up their brains and make for Complacency, where a mature air of timidity is key.
My own confusion lingers; I have the notion that “to whom much is given, much is required,” and so what puzzles me is how damn much we’re not doing, socially, obviously.
It’s alright that we have unique campuses, communities unto ourselves, as prideful and pompous as the bookstores are expensive.
Just give me some sign that I am not alone, learning, trying to make my life an act of gratitude toward those who made my freedom.
I am not a Republican, nor a Democrat, yet, nor particularly knowledgeable about most politics.
Yet I am a citizen, and I vote.
You see that I am concerned about public education–simply because I have heard, read, and seen some alarming things–rightly, as any other man has the right to be fed up with anything else.
Oftentimes I carry on politically flavored conversations with parents and teachers, and they quickly degenerate into a trail of complaints about the education system.
Then when someone leaves the room scratching his head, it gives me as much satisfaction as scratching my own.
I know, that when I make an impression, I am part of democracy.
Rick Perlstein notes “bucolic images of a mystic world apart, where 18-year-olds discover themselves for the first time in a heady atmosphere of cultural and intellectual tumult.” This is precisely the atmosphere that does the yanking, and for that reason it is critical.
Today there are still brilliant individuals, we all meet them, ready to take on all manner of activities to satisfy their interests and appetites for learning; they likely are continuing their good pursuits.
For the popular majority, it is appropriate, though not by any means necessary, to bloom in freshman year of college and not before.
It’s the same thing as high school, just no parents.
Wait, yes parents, every minute on speed-dial.
If college really mattered, freshman year would be imagined as absolutely different, totally transporting.
“Cast your eye over America.
Who are the men of most learning, of most eloquence, most beloved by their countrymen and most trusted and promoted by them?
They are those who have been educated among them and whose manners, morals and habits are perfectly homogeneous with those of the country.”
Jefferson again.
No, not thinking of a great tribe of conformists, but rather of those who have an eye for what is needful, people who trust in the progress of the nation and the world, not the progress of their own interests.
OK, maybe there is a texting movement…I may have a backward view, being a student and not a statistician.
Nevertheless I think college students are primed to do the best things in the world, and so they should act like it.
In the face of modernity and its distractions such potential is hard to see.
When we get over our pride and see it, imagining the country and the pace of all things changing, and at once the future seems at stake in our hands, then college will matter.
A key reason is the mounting risk of a recession in America.
The bursting of the sub-prime mortgage bubble — strikingly reminiscent of the dot-com excesses of the 1990s — could well be a tipping point.
But the lessons of post-bubble adjustments are clear.
Just ask economically stagnant Japan.

Sadly, the endgame could be considerably more treacherous for the United States than it was seven years ago.
In large part, that’s because the American consumer is now at risk.
Consumption expenditures currently account for a record 72 percent of the gross domestic product — a number unmatched in the annals of modern history for any nation.
This buying binge has been increasingly supported by housing and lending bubbles.
Yet home prices are now headed lower — probably for years — and the fallout from the subprime crisis has seriously crimped home mortgage refinancing.
With weaker employment growth also putting pressure on income, the days of open-ended American consumption are likely to finally come to an end.
That will make it hard to avoid a recession.

Fearful of that possibility, foreign investors are becoming increasingly skittish over buying dollar-based assets.
The spillover effects of the subprime crisis into other asset markets — especially mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed commercial paper — underscore these concerns.
Foreign appetite for United States financial instruments is likely to be sharply reduced for years to come.
That would choke off an important avenue of capital inflows, putting more downward pressure on the dollar.

The political winds are also blowing against the dollar.
In Washington, China-bashing is the bipartisan sport du jour.
New legislation is likely that would impose trade sanctions on China unless it makes a major adjustment in its currency.
Not only would this be an egregious policy blunder — attempting to fix a multilateral deficit with more than 40 nations by forcing an exchange rate adjustment with one country — but it would also amount to Washington taxing one of America’s major foreign lenders.

That would undoubtedly reduce China’s desire for United States assets, and unless another foreign buyer stepped up, the dollar would come under even more pressure.
Moreover, the more the Fed under Ben Bernanke follows the easy-money Alan Greenspan script, the greater the risk to the dollar.
Why worry about a weaker dollar?
A sharp drop in the dollar makes those items considerably more expensive — the functional equivalent of a tax hike on consumers.
It could also stoke fears of inflation — driving up long-term interest rates and putting more pressure on financial markets and the economy, exacerbating recession risks.
Optimists may draw comfort from the vision of an export-led renewal arising from a more competitive dollar.
Yet history is clear: no nation has ever devalued its way into prosperity.

The Scene
Hermann is steeped in wine culture, with eight wineries within a 20-mile radius.
Some are cottage industries, growing grape vines the way their neighbors grow grass.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The wineries bring tourists who stay in the region’s more than 70 bed-and-breakfasts, nose around the antiques shops and buy authentic German sausages from the Swiss Meat Market 12 miles south of town.
Local residents are more often found downing a burger and a Bud at the Barrel.
Those with a taste for elegance and a beverage that isn’t Busch-bred are better off at restaurants like Europa, whose name sums up its menu; the Vintage, where the German food is good but the Stone Hill wines are better; and the Cottage, which has a limited menu but a lush hilltop setting.
Hermann also officially celebrates its German roots.
On the third weekend of May, there’s Maifest, which focuses on dancing, parades and crafts.
Octoberfest brings four weekends of wine tours, music and food, and in December, the town features a traditional German Christmas market.

But for Mr. Dierberg, the town is not just about German wines and German heritage, it’s about the way it looks.

“Mainly, it’s the buildings that do it for me,” he said.
“But it’s also the way the hills sit against the water, and how they come down into the valley.
I can be driving out of St. Louis, and I might be in a hurry and talking on the phone, and even if it’s cloudy, I come into this valley and it’s like the sun comes out, and everything’s nice.”

Pros
Unlike the Ozarks several hours south, the Hermann hills have no water parks, music theaters, casinos or magic shows — just rambling woods cut by fields, white-fenced horse farms, brick farmhouses enveloped in ancient trees and wineries.
And its residents like it that way.
Cons
Being nestled in a crook of the wide Missouri has two major disadvantages: Hermann is steamy in summer, and the low-lying areas near the Missouri River and its tributaries are susceptible to flooding after heavy rains.
Cultural and arts events are scarce, and to take in something in St. Louis is a 160-mile round trip.

Jim Grebing, Hermann’s tourism director, said: “It’s not really a child-friendly place in that instead of water parks, we have wineries and bed-and-breakfasts.
And many of the bed-and-breakfasts don’t take children because of the antiques and breakage and so forth.
On the other hand, many of the people who go to the bed-and-breakfasts go there to get away from the kids.”
The Real Estate Market
With little building going on, old houses trump new ones in Hermann.
Compact three-bedroom cottages deliver four-season views of the river and low upkeep for $150,000.
A furnished B & B-ready cottage is listed for $169,900.
Roughly 10 percent of the housing stock in the area are second homes, according to Mr. Grebing.

The median price for a house in Hermann is $170,000 to $180,000, said Judy Warden of Warden Real Estate.
Recent sales include a four-bedroom house that was built in 1941 for $88,500.
Unusual for Hermann, which likes to consider itself the anti-Branson, a development of five second homes, each one on 32 acres, is being built on the other side of the river around an artificial lake.
Jeff Kelly, a builder from Chesterfield, near St. Louis, who is on the development team (and is building his own second home), said, “We figure it’ll be removed from the sprawl of St. Louis for another 15 or 20 years.”

Speaking of the development, Mr. Kelly added: “The wine-country aspect adds to the appeal tremendously.
Plus the culture, plus the rolling Midwestern countryside, plus the occasional alpaca farm.”

Even so, Katy Wehrle, a broker with Wehrle Real Estate, said: “It’s slow right now.
Interest rates have held things back, and gas prices haven’t helped.
But even with that, people who have a 6,000-square-foot home in St. Louis are buying a 1,500-square-foot home in Hermann.
They see it as a steppingstone to get them to where they really want to be.”
She added, “This has always been a well-kept secret in that regard, but I think its days as a secret are about done.”

Even in the United States, the market’s return has been led by sectors like energy, industrials, materials and technology, which investors believe are best positioned to take advantage of the growth abroad.

The rising value of houses also allowed homeowners to make frequent withdrawals from home equity A.T.M.’s, cash that they often spent on remodeling, vacations or buying sport utility vehicles.

But now it has done just that, taking more than the home builders down with it.
The housing slowdown is hurting all the industries it helped on the way up, and home equity withdrawals have turned into mortgage defaults.

Can the subprime mortgage damage remain contained?
It could.
But one could make a compelling case that it will ultimately ripple through the economy until it hits consumer spending.

If it gets that far, most companies will suddenly be under pressure and will respond by trimming spending (advertising, salaries, jobs).
And if that happens, the “virtuous cycle” that powered the expansion will have reversed, and the resulting profit crunch will take the market down with it.
Moving back in history, other crashes have played out in slow motion, too.
The Great Crash of 1929 is recalled as a few brutal days in October, but the market had been dropping for nearly two months.
And what about Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and his celebrated rate cuts?
Will they save the market?
Perhaps.
But despite what the recent euphoric market move may make you think, stocks don’t always soar after rate cuts.

In the months leading up to that first rate cut, Wall Street strategists urged everyone to load up on stocks because rate cuts usually marked the bottom.

African Violet Flowers
Q. I have always kept my African violets in a somewhat shaded western window.
I use the same food and don’t understand where the flowers have gone.
How can I bring them back?
A. African violets need at least 10 hours of bright but diffused light to bloom.
Southeast or west facing windows are better than direct sun, except in the dead of winter.
It sounds as though the non-blooming plants have been watered and fed but not otherwise tended.
If that is the case, they are almost surely too crowded.
And if they have not been repotted yearly they are overdue for a change.
African violets prefer a very light, freely draining growing medium.
Packaged soil labeled for African violets is seldom porous enough.

Recent surveys have shown shakier consumer and business confidence in Europe in the wake of the credit market turmoil, which has led to emergency rescues at two German banks and one in Britain.

“Corporate earnings and profitability have been sustained, employment growth has been robust and unemployment has fallen,” Mr. Trichet said.

With financial markets skeptical that the Bush administration wholeheartedly backs this policy, the message has barely altered the euro’s upward trend against the dollar.

One month after it abandoned a planned increase in borrowing costs in the face of credit market chaos, the European Central Bank gave little indication of when — or if — it would resume lifting its benchmark rate.

Under the treaties that created the euro, the bank’s chief priority is to fight inflation, which is now edging above 2 percent because of higher oil and food prices, slightly above the bank’s comfort zone.
Over the last two years, the bank has steadily raised rates to ensure that accelerating growth does not lead to a spiral of rising prices as companies pass on the costs of more expensive raw materials to consumers or bid up the price of labor amid falling unemployment — dangers that Mr. Trichet said were still very much present in the euro area.
In its monthly statement, the bank did drop a reference to interest rates being “on the accommodative side,” a sign that it has finished tightening credit.
But Mr. Trichet repeatedly emphasized that the bank “stands ready to act” to ward off higher inflation with higher rates, even though it is clearly pausing to gather more information about the effects of the credit squeeze.

“As long as they are concerned about inflation, it doesn’t really matter how they characterize their stance on interest rates,” said Elga Bartsch, an economist with Morgan Stanley in London.
“But they are on hold for now.”
One reason the bank may have altered its trajectory on interest rates is that credit markets have done the bank’s job for it over the last two months, economists said.
As nervous banks and investors have curbed their lending, they have forced up the cost of borrowing, effectively creating the tighter credit conditions that central banks use to keep inflation under control.

Still, the bank has to preserve its options in case the outlook for inflation worsens — an entirely plausible event given escalating oil and commodity prices — while bearing in mind that higher interest rates could worsen the credit squeeze and hurt manufacturers and other companies.
Why the difference?

The picture in commercial paper is similar.
The outstanding volume of asset-backed commercial paper — often issued by companies whose own credit is less than sterling — continued to rise during the early part of the credit crisis.
In the last eight weeks, almost a quarter of the asset-backed paper has been redeemed.

But the outstanding volume of other commercial paper, which is more likely to be issued by companies with solid credit, has begun to rise again after falling for several weeks, another sign that the credit freeze is thawing.

For banks, meanwhile, the loan books have swelled, in some cases against their will.
Many banks had issued promises to finance loans if securities could not be sold.
The volume of commercial and industrial loans by domestically chartered banks has soared at the fastest rate since early 1974, when a recession sent corporate customers scrambling to borrow money.

Part of the rise reflects leveraged loans that could not be syndicated to foreign banks or investors, but most of it probably represents new loans that in previous months would have been done through the credit market.
THE experience at Swoon Kitchenbar in Hudson begins before you even enter the restaurant.
Pots of flowers and herbs — sage, lemon thyme — line the ramp up to the entrance, enveloping you in a kind of tunnel filled with the sights and smells of nature.
It’s the perfect preparation for the food to come, which is startlingly fresh and beautifully presented and, despite its sophistication, tastes close to the earth.
Swoon Kitchenbar marries the best of city-based training with the advantages of Hudson Valley ingredients acquired within miles of this Columbia County restaurant.
The result is worth a detour during a weekend drive, or even as a destination in itself.
The restaurant is the three-year-old effort of Jeff Gimmel and his wife, Nina Bachinsky-Gimmel.
They are passionate advocates of the idea that using locally produced food improves taste, and they proudly list their area suppliers on the menu, which changes daily depending on what’s available.
Items that can’t be bought locally are delivered as quickly as possible.
Most of the seafood, which dominates in summer especially, is Fed Exed daily from Portland, Me.

Q.
We see the pizza-size dishes used to pick up satellite TV signals, so how does that stubby, pencil-size antenna on my portable G.P.S.
receiver get information from a satellite in orbit more than 12,000 miles up?
A.
The global positioning system receiver is pulling in a much simpler set of data, said Alan J. Friedman, consulting senior scientist for the New York Hall of Science.
“Since it is all digital, that’s a lot of numbers which must be transmitted and received every second, and the receiver’s dish antenna has to pick out those numbers from the electronic noise all around us.”
The G.P.S.
receiver needs only two small sets of numbers from each of four or more satellites: the time on a super-precise clock in each satellite and the position of that satellite.
The time on each satellite’s clock will appear to have tiny variations from satellite to satellite because of their motion as they orbit the Earth, Dr. Friedman explained.
“Those tiny differences, and the positions of the satellites, are fed to a computer chip inside the G.P.S.
receiver (programmed using relativity theory) to calculate where the receiver must be on the Earth,” Dr. Friedman said.
“Anyplace else on the Earth, the numbers would have been different at that moment in time.”
The current rate chasers are of all ages and means, although no one tracks their numbers and demographics.

Like their day-trading predecessors, rate chasers are all online.
“Rate chasing has never been easier than in the last two years, because of the Internet and personal finance sites like Bankrate.com that have aggregated listings of providers chomping at the bit to get your business with the highest rates,” said Edward Woods, a senior analyst at Celent, a financial services research and consulting firm based in Boston.
Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said, “There’s a big disparity between letting money languish in a low-yielding account at your typical brick-and-mortar bank where the average passbook savings account is less than 1 percent and the high-yield accounts, where they top 5 percent.
But, he added, “whether it makes sense to chase every little change in rates depends on how much money you have to play with.”

The roots of online rate chasing go back to 1996, when NetBank, the first significant Internet-only operation, offered savings rates that were higher than any on a brick-and-mortar passbook account, so long as savers were willing to open an account at a bank with no physical branches.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Then, in September 2000, ING Direct, an online division of the Dutch banking giant ING Group, offered a 6.5 percent savings rate at a time when passbook accounts in the United States were averaging 1.66 percent, according to Bankrate.com.
Although there were smaller online banks offering the same rate or a little more, ING Direct had the resources to pay for a huge national advertising campaign featuring a distinctive orange ball.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Today, the bank still has roughly half the $150 billion in online deposits in the United States, according to Mr. Bruene, even though it has not offered the highest rates in recent years.
Rate chasing really began to take off in January 2005, when the online bank Emigrant Direct came on the scene with a 3 percent savings rate, topping ING Direct, which was offering 2.35 percent at the time.

In March 2006, Citibank introduced its online brand, Citibank Direct, with a 4.5 percent savings interest rate.
“When it’s Citibank, that gets the attention of every large bank.
If they hadn’t been thinking of starting an online brand before, they were then.”

Today, there are some two dozen major online-only banking brands in the United States, most of them divisions of regional, national and global banks, Mr. Bruene said.
All use high rates to attract new customers to whom they can peddle more profitable products like checking accounts and loans.

“When banks choose to lower those high rates to improve their bottom lines, they do it knowing some customers — namely, the rate chasers — will move on,” Mr. Bruene said.

“This is not a rate game we are playing, it’s a long-term plan,” he said.
“Like other regional banks, we are on the defense against giant banks coming into our American plains and buying up branches.
The Internet has allowed us to go national without opening branches, and this is our effort to position our bank in an industry that will be totally online in 10 to 20 years.”
Through September, FNBO Direct attracted 36,000 new accounts with total deposits of $1.5 billion, Mr. Johri estimated.

Three weeks into its 6 percent rate, FNBO Direct imposed a $1 million limit on new deposits.
“We did not want a handful of people using our bank for a short period of time,” Mr. Johri said.

Those over their limits probably believe the federal government will protect them, Ms. Warren said.
“People remember that during the 1980s savings and loan crisis, it didn’t let depositors who’d exceeded their limits go down.”

Ms. Warren added: “Although many savers are sophisticated enough to understand the stock market is the place to be long term, they believe its fundamentals are crazy now and they cannot tolerate the risk.
I’m one — my husband and I got out this summer and put our money into C.D.’s.”
Even investors with no plans to exit the market are sedately chasing online.
Warren Wagner, 66, a retired government bond dealer and seasoned individual investor from Tahoe City, Calif., currently has 40 percent of his holdings in cash as he waits to resume active trading later this year.
For the cash in his portfolio, he bids online for C.D.’s at Zions Direct, a division of Zions Bank of Salt Lake City.
“I am getting the highest safe yield I can right now,” he said.

At the other end of the spectrum are chasers using borrowed credit card money, which Ms. Warren called “odd risk-taking behavior.” But it makes sense to Mr. Ferris, the software engineer who depends on his money management software to be “the biggest rate chaser out there.” He said he had gains of $9,000 before taxes since he started chasing rates two years ago.
Many were considering C.D.’s, previously heresy for pure chasers accustomed to being able to take advantage of competing banks’ rates.
“Why put your money in the market when you can have a 9.36 percent sure thing?” Mr. Ferris asked.
“In seven months, it’ll be time to chase rates again, and who knows where they’ll be by then.”

“All the money would flow on a monthly or quarterly basis and be managed just like a car loan.

Virgin Money earns revenue from the fees charged to borrowers.
The company plans to have a coming-out party in Boston today, taking over Copley Square.
Mr. Branson will be on hand as red dollar bills with a picture of him and his mother are distributed; according to Mr. Advani, Mr. Branson’s mother lent him “thousands of pounds” to help him start Virgin (and he repaid her).
The dollar bills, directing people to a company Web site, will also be handed out in New York.
Virgin Money USA will offer personal and business loans, mortgages and reverse mortgages.
The average interest rate for loans is 6 percent, and for mortgages, 5 percent.
Borrowers are charged a $9 per payment administrative fee and will pay an upfront charge ranging from $99 for unsecured loans to $2,000 for large mortgages.
Borrowers can select terms of their loans, including the duration and rates.
The bank will not retain any of the interest.

Will the law of unintended consequences come into play in the aftermath of Altria’s decision to relocate?
Will the highly influential but largely silent leadership of New York City’s great cultural institutions, long prevailed upon to avoid biting the hand that fed it, now feel free to speak out openly against the harm wrought by Altria (formerly Philip Morris) everywhere it does business?
Will we see, at long last, an end to hush money in the guise of support for the arts?
Hope springs eternal.

Branford, Conn., Oct. 9, 2007
New data on the economy presented a mixed picture Friday, providing little guidance for investors ahead of the Federal Reserve board’s meeting next week to consider a possible interest rate cut.
Inventories continue to move higher, with home builders now saddled with 8.3 months’ worth of unsold supply.
“This was on the whole another quite weak report, particularly given the aggressive price-cutting that homebuilders have been implementing in order to try to reduce inventory,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, in a research report.
David Kovacs, senior portfolio manager at Turner Investment Partners, finds the figures heartening.
The heavy use of buybacks shows him that executives are optimistic about their stocks.
“Insiders know what they’re doing,” he said.
“If they’re net buyers, it means they’re bullish.”

Pete Kendall, co-editor of The Elliott Wave Financial Forecast newsletter, says Mr. Kovacs may be giving executives too much credit.
“I tend to think of it as another sentiment indicator,” he said of buybacks.
“Just as investors get more bullish as the market rises, company officers get caught up in their own share price.”
Mr. Kovacs conceded that the issuance figures may not be as compelling as they seem at first, but for a different reason.
Companies may be making liberal distributions to shareholders, but they have not been turning down money when it is offered to them.
Extremely low interest rates on loans and bonds have made debt financing far cheaper than issuing stock; some companies, in fact, have borrowed to finance buyback programs.
Net debt issuance is at record levels, a $600 billion annual rate, as equity issuance has hit bottom.

THE math that made borrowing so appealing changed months ago, however, when lenders yanked credit from the shakiest borrowers and raised rates on all but the soundest ones.
That may reduce the money available to finance buybacks and private equity deals, which often involve borrowing to acquire the equity in a targeted company.

It may also drive companies to sell stock instead of tapping bankers or the bond market.

He played down the importance of buybacks, which he sees as a substitute for conventional dividend payments — and a less rigorous one at that.
Companies can buy back shares, or not, whenever they feel like it; dividend payments represent a firmer commitment to pay shareholders, he said.
He added that payout ratios, that is, the percentage of earnings disbursed as dividends, are close to a record low.

Mr. Kendall considers the growth in buybacks a negative because it indicates that companies cannot think of anything better to do with their cash than to return it to shareholders.

Cash has remained above 8.5 percent of corporate assets since 2002 after having never reached that level at least since 1978.
For Mr. Kovacs the strength of balance sheets, even with extensive share repurchases and liberal debt financing, shows just how encouraging the issuance data is.

Shrugging off spiking crude, traders bought stocks yesterday in expectation of an interest rate cut by Federal Reserve policy makers at their meeting beginning today.
Investors say a cut could provide relief from problems in the housing and credit markets and help counter the risk that expensive energy, by pinching consumers’ pocketbooks, will lead to a downturn in overall spending.
Consumer spending is a major component of domestic economic growth.

Some analysts and economists expect the Canadian dollar to go past $1.0614 soon, the highest level it has achieved since Canada become an independent nation in 1867.
The Canadian dollar has now risen almost 70 percent since its low of 61.79 cents in 2002.
Some of the increase is attributable to high prices for Canadian energy and mining exports.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.38 percent, from 4.40 percent.

And the Commerce Department released a report on consumer spending that, on another day, might have been mildly reassuring.
“People are getting nervous looking to the holiday season,” said Anthony Conroy, head equity trader at BNY ConvergEx Group.
“People are going to be spending less because they’re paying more for oil and mortgage payments there.”

Investors may also have been unnerved by the disappointing economic data.
Increases in consumer spending, a category that accounts for nearly 70 percent of economic activity, began to slow in September, up 0.3 percent after a 0.5 percent gain in August.
That came in 0.1 percent below analysts’ estimates, underscoring concerns that rising energy costs and the fall in housing values were stemming consumption.

Now as the record high price of oil has made exploitation worthwhile even in places that are remote or geologically complicated (Chad comes to mind), more underdeveloped countries have to choose what to do with their oil.
Those that have long held oil must decide how to spend the incomprehensible amounts of money oil is now bringing them.

Historically, almost every country dependent on the export of oil has answered this question in the same way: badly.
It may seem paradoxical, but finding a hole in the ground that spouts money can be one of the worst things to happen to a nation.
With one or two exceptions, oil-dependent countries are poorer, more conflict-ridden and despotic.
OPEC’s own studies show the perils of relying on oil.
Between 1965 and 1998, the economies of OPEC members contracted by 1.3 percent a year.
Oil-dependent nations do especially badly by their poor: infant survival, nutrition, life expectancy, literacy, schooling — all are worse in oil-producing countries.
The history of oil-dependent countries has produced what Terry Lynn Karl, a Stanford University professor, calls the paradox of plenty.
Oil not only creates very few jobs, it also destroys jobs in other sectors.
By pushing up a country’s exchange rate, the export of oil distorts the economy.
“Oil rents drive out any other productive activity,” Karl says.
“Why would you bother to produce your own food if you could buy it?
Why would you bother to develop any kind of export industry if oil makes your money worth more and that hurts all your other exports?” The most successful societies develop a middle class through manufacturing; oil makes this extremely difficult.
Oil concentrates a country’s wealth in the state, creating a culture where money is made by soliciting politicians and bureaucrats rather than by making things and selling them.
Oil states also ask their citizens for little in taxes, and where citizens pay little in taxes, they demand little in accountability.
Those in power distribute oil money to stay in power.
Thus oil states tend to be highly corrupt.

II.
Venezuela is a typical victim of the oil curse.
It has become a rich country of poor people.
Teodoro Petkoff has seen Venezuela through booms and busts.
Once a daring leftist guerrilla who in 2006 was briefly a candidate against Chávez, he publishes a newspaper, Tal Cual, that criticizes both Chávez and the opposition.
“The state is hypertrophic here, a monster complex on top of society, heavy and corrupt.
It has been the great contractor, the great buyer, the great provider, the great receiver.
To win government is to get access to a source of personal enrichment.
Money has to pass through the state.
Oil has weakened our collective morality.
It obliges you to be corrupt.
You can’t do business if you are not corrupt.
We are waiting for the easy deal, big winnings.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Chávez has promised to break this curse, to finally use Venezuela’s oil to benefit its people.
Oil is everything in Venezuela; it pays for at least half the government’s expenditures and 90 percent of its foreign exchange, according Orlando Ochoa, a prominent economist.
Now “zero misery” is one of the government’s slogans, and the vehicle to get there is oil.
Chávez’s oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., or Pdvsa (pronounced peh-deh-VEH-sah — S.A. stands for “sociedad anónima,” or incorporated), is proudly inefficient, proudly political.
Chávez has called his revolution “oil socialism.”

“We are doing what the old regimes didn’t do,” Bernardo Álvarez, Venezuela’s ambassador to Washington and a former vice minister of hydrocarbons in the Ministry of Energy, said to me.
“We are putting oil into a sustained process of development.
Our first priority is a fight against poverty and exclusion.”
To that end, Pdvsa is investing the company’s profits in helping dropouts finish high school and not just in drilling wells.
“Perhaps it was better run before Chávez,” says Roger Tissot, a Latin America analyst based in British Columbia who works for PFC Energy.
“But it wasn’t efficient in meeting the needs of the shareholders — the people of Venezuela.
Today perhaps it is less efficient but better at meeting social goals.”
Whether this is the right decision turns on whether this policy is sustainable.
Today, oil money feeds and educates poor neighborhoods.
The purpose of the national oil company is not to produce more oil, but to produce Bolivarian socialism.
These are two very different ways to handle a nation’s oil resource.
Can either model show poor countries how to convert natural resources into sustained wealth?
Few questions in economic policy are more important today.

III.
Many nationalized oil companies are poorly managed — on average, national companies are 65 percent as efficient as private ones, according to one study.
Still, it is possible to have a stellar national oil company, efficient in the classic sense, one that can compete favorably with any Western major.
Saudi Aramco and Petrobras, in Brazil, are two examples.
Szabo now runs a software company in Houston, but until 1983, he was a high-level executive at Pdvsa.
Except for the destination of the revenues, nothing.
Literally nothing.
Venezuelans demanded that the profits stay at home.
“To keep it healthy you must leave it alone.
Because wells run dry and machinery ages, oil companies everywhere must invest lots of money just to keep production steady, and to grow, they need even more.
Without new investment, Pdvsa would lose 25 percent of its oil production every year.
“But I think the priority has to be to maintain oil.
If you have one dollar left, it should be invested in keeping capacity.
Otherwise next time around you will not have a single dollar to distribute.”
Espinasa, now 55, lives in Washington and works as an energy consultant to the Inter-American Development Bank.
The bulk of Venezuela’s oil lies under a 4,500-square-mile savanna called the Orinoco Belt.
The reserves are enormous, but 20 years ago it was not clear that they would be commercially viable.
It required expensive technology and expertise to extract, and even then only a small percentage of the oil could be recovered.
This crude also needed a special refining process and would most likely sell at a discount.

To ensure there would be a market for Orinoco crude, in 1982 Pdvsa began to buy refineries overseas able to process it.
By the end of the 1990s, Pdvsa was among the top three oil refiners in the U.S. “With heavy oil, if you don’t own a refinery, your production does not have a home,” Szabo says.
“If you own a refinery, you have market share.” And Pdvsa in the 1990s was focused on maximizing its market share in the United States.

Pdvsa executives also decided they didn’t want to take on the debt and risk of developing the Orinoco, so in 1989 they began to open it to private participation.

In hindsight, these were brilliant business decisions.
Pdvsa’s refineries overseas are making record profits, and the United States is the company’s biggest customer.

In fact, some of Pdvsa’s shrewd business decisions seem to have been made with an eye to shielding its gains from the government.
Economists on the left who are critical of the old Pdvsa argue that the foreign holdings allowed the company to play with costs and profits.
It could sell oil to its refineries at less than market price — thus incurring lower taxes.
Pdvsa’s resources and talent outshone that of the Energy Ministry, which was supposed to be overseeing it.
“When the I.M.F.
“At the ministry,” Álvarez says, “we had gone from 200 engineers to 25.
One energy minister used to call it ‘the Empire.’ ”

Pdvsa won virtually every argument.
But many people, not just Chavistas, would argue that Venezuela lost.
“It was normal for people working for Pdvsa to be very proud — it was recognized as one of the best oil companies,” says Tissot, the oil analyst.
“In contrast, the politicians were making a mess managing the rest of the country.

“It shouldn’t have,” he replied.
Ten years later, Pdvsa is no longer an oil company, at least by Espinasa’s standards.
It now exists to finance Chávez’s transformation of Venezuela.
The integration is illustrated by the fact that Rafael Ramírez, the minister of energy and petroleum, is also president of Pdvsa.
“The Pdvsa that neglected the people and indifferently watched the misery and poverty in the communities surrounding the company premises is over,” Ramírez has said.
Chávez travels a lot.
Foreign presidents who receive him may enjoy receiving his customary gift — a replica of the sword of Bolívar.
But they probably appreciate even more the oil that sometimes comes with it.
Chávez provides discounted or free oil to Central American and Caribbean countries, sending nearly 100,000 barrels a day to Cuba in exchange for doctors and Cuban expertise on state security.
He has given millions in non-oil aid to various Latin American countries, much of it in the form of energy projects.
Citgo says it gave $80 million in heating oil to poor residents of the South Bronx last winter.
Pdvsa is also subsidizing Venezuela’s domestic oil consumption.
The Venezuelans feel it is their oil; why should they have to pay for it?
But the subsidies are much deeper and the quantities greater today.
A gallon of gasoline costs 6.3 cents at the pump at the unofficial exchange rate.
And Venezuela is now gorging on gas.
Venezuela will add 450,000 new cars this year — about four times the number of four years ago.
Six Hummer dealerships are set to open early next year.

Oil is now used to create electricity.
Some of Venezuela’s electric plants used to burn natural gas, but gas production has dropped, creating shortages that oil is filling.
Domestic consumption of oil has reached at least 650,000 barrels a day, according to Venezuelan economists.
Venezuela is importing oil products and may soon have to import gasoline.
There is also the problem of contraband: subsidized gasoline smuggled out and sold at world-market prices in Colombia and the Caribbean.
Between its domestic consumption and its use of oil to make friends overseas, Venezuela gives away or subsidizes a third of its production.
Most of the rest is sold in the United States.

The money that Pdvsa does get from selling at market prices goes to finance Chávez’s revolution at home.
Last year, Pdvsa’s payments to the state totaled more than $35 billion, counting taxes, royalties and direct support for social programs.
This is 35 percent of the company’s gross earnings.
Almost $14 billion is spent at the sole discretion of Chávez.
It is called social-development money, although it appears that there is little “social” in some of its spending.
Much of the money goes to the Fund for National Development, or Fonden, an off-budget fund controlled by Chávez, which also takes foreign reserves from the Central Bank.
What Fonden actually buys, for how much, from whom and through what process is a mystery.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The more celebrated of Pdvsa’s projects is a network of social programs, called misiones.
These missions bring health clinics and classrooms directly into poor neighborhoods.
They are financed and in some cases run directly by Pdvsa.
“Today, the president gets on the phone with Ramírez and in an hour can get $200 million.”
To finance all these ambitious projects, Pdvsa must produce oil.
Theoretically this should not be a problem.
(Venezuela crude trades at slightly under the average OPEC crude price.)
Chávez is the beneficiary of the greatest oil windfall the world has seen, one based in part on political upheaval in Iran, Iraq and Nigeria but also on a surge in demand from China and India that is unlikely to end soon.
So, for the foreseeable future, there should be money for everything.

Yet Pdvsa is in trouble.
V.
One good way to see Pdvsa’s many challenges up close is to look at the mystery of the missing drilling rigs.
A rig has two jobs: to drill down in auspicious spots to look for oil, and to clear out working wells when they clog, like a giant Roto-Rooter.
Because oil is so profitable and people are drilling madly, there is a global shortage of rigs, and the price of renting them has gone up.
But Venezuela’s shortage is worse than elsewhere.
But according to Baker Hughes, the Houston firm that provides the world’s standard count of rigs, there are only 73 active rigs in Venezuela.
Rig procurement is going badly.
Vierma called this “a silent sabotage by multinational companies.”
Photo
Others might call it the market at work.
Rigs are in high demand; rigs cost at least $15 million, and an offshore rig can cost more than $95 million.
Why go to Venezuela?
“The big contractors want to take their rigs somewhere with less risk and threat of confiscation,” one executive of a big drilling contractor in Venezuela told me.
“The way this government talks, it sends investors running.”

I went to Lake Maracaibo to see the problem for myself.
Maracaibo is South America’s largest lake, a huge basin of duckweed and sewage, where significant oil drilling first began in the 1920s.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Driving down the lake’s eastern shore one hot, rainy morning, I passed Pdvsa’s Maracaibo complex.
In 1997, there were 57 rigs working on the lake.
I saw more rigs, including seven in Pdvsa’s yards, along the lake shore, docked along the bank.
“Why aren’t they out on the lake working if there’s such a shortage?”

Like others I spoke with, he didn’t want to be identified.
“I estimate that there are about 22 rigs sitting idle around the lake, but not all of them are operable, due to lack of maintenance, or because they require additional equipment,” he told me.
But it’s not clear that Pdvsa can do the work at all.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
I counted at least 10 rigs belonging to Pdvsa that were not even being worked on — the company’s management is so poor, contractors said, that it cannot coordinate getting rigs repaired.
Pdvsa is responsible for servicing all rigs working on the lake.
“You need a boat to come out to give you water, diesel, empty the cuttings, take away waste,” one contractor said.
“But I’ve waited a week for them just to take trash off the rigs.” There may be other reasons there are few working rigs.
Vierma himself was briefly being investigated by the National Assembly — notable, given that it contains no opposition members — for overseeing the purchase of rigs from companies that supposedly had no rigs, no experience and little capital.
VI.
Pdvsa’s administrative troubles can be traced back to one of the biggest threats to Chávez’s presidency.
Pdvsa has since replaced the strikers, though the new hires are largely inexperienced.
In fact, Pdvsa now employs 75,000 workers, many more than in the past, and Chávez says he wants to increase the number to 102,000 next year.
Part of Chávez’s new “oil socialism” is to make Pdvsa more self-sufficient, reducing dependence on outside service companies.
So Pdvsa is creating new subsidiaries.
One is a new oil-services unit — “our own Halliburton, ours, the ‘Bolivarian’ one,” Ramírez, the energy minister, told state TV.
Pdvsa has also announced plans to build oil ships and drill rigs.
In June, Pdvsa approved the creation of seven new subsidiaries, including ones to grow soybeans for ethanol, to build food-processing plants and even to make shoes.
Pdvsa is running a parallel state.
The company’s workers must all have at least one qualification: they must be Chavistas.
The company is “red, red from top to bottom,” he said.
Pdvsa also wrote a letter to its contractors, warning them not to hire any of the 18,000 fired workers.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
As Pdvsa has been molded to Chávez’s will, it has also become less and less transparent in its dealings.
The company used to publish a standard annual report, but after 2004 it stopped filing its annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In recent years it has released only a page or two of basic figures, with no breakdowns or auditors’ notes.
When Pdvsa does release information, some of it is of questionable credibility.
Even the most fundamental operational fact — how much oil Venezuela produces — is subject to debate.
Today, Pdvsa claims the country produces the same amount, but independent sources, including OPEC, say that figure is too high; OPEC puts Venezuela’s production at 2.4 million barrels a day last year.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
What is clear is that much of the oil revenue is going to social spending.
Last year, Pdvsa says it spent nearly $14 billion on social programs.
That includes the missions and Fonden, but does not include taxes and royalties of $21 billion paid to the government.
Pdvsa says it put $5.8 billion back into the company last year.
While this is a $2 billion hike from 2005, it most likely includes items that no one would call investment in oil; a secret addendum to the 2007 budget described “investment” as including money for national infrastructure and social projects.
Pdvsa’s own business plan calls for rapid growth in production, but oil analysts say the company is clearly not investing enough.
According to Pavel Molchanov, who studies oil in Houston at Raymond James, a financial services company, Pdvsa has had two years of production decline and is likely to have at least two more.
“This is against a background of global oil production increasing 1 to 2 percent a year,” he says.
“If they were spending enough would their production be down?
I don’t think so.” (I would have liked to have asked Ramírez about this and many other matters.
Pdvsa is also taking on debt.
The company had very little debt until 2006, but this year it has borrowed $12.5 billion.
While raising cash through debt offerings can be fiscally sound, and many companies do so, critics contend that Pdvsa is issuing bonds for the wrong reasons.
“Their debts are low, but they didn’t have any before,” says José Guerra, formerly chief of the research department of the Central Bank, who left in disagreement about Chávez’s economic policies.
“Other oil countries are getting rid of debt.
And what is the debt going for?
Their spending on exploration is almost nothing.
They are taking on debt to have a party.”
Some of the private companies that the old Pdvsa had brought in are still working in Venezuela, but they are now only minority partners and are paying higher taxes and royalties.
On May 1, foreign companies working in the Orinoco were told to cede majority control of their projects to Pdvsa.
Two companies, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, left and are now negotiating with Venezuela about compensation.
Other companies, seemingly chosen for their geopolitical value, have come into the Orinoco to take their place and develop virgin areas: national oil companies from big producers like Russia, China, Brazil and Iran, but also Cuba, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina and Belarus, which presumably can bring little expertise to the business of heavy oil.

VII.
Pdvsa is now dedicated to creating a new oil product: it is turning petroleum directly into math problems.
Caraballo, who is 32, lives in the El Encanto section of La Vega, a slum on the side of one of the steep mountains around Caracas.
He is a committed Chavista and a committed socialist.
“Money should serve people and not the other way around,” he told me.
There were 11 adults, some with young children, in the room, studying the addition and multiplication of fractions.
The students — known in the program as vencedores, or triumphers — all had workbooks, and they had already watched a 45-minute video of a math lesson.

This was an eighth-grade class of Misión Ribas, a program that brings grades 6 through 12 to barrios around the country.
This class meets from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. every weeknight in Caraballo’s house.
The videos come from Cuba, and facilitators like Medina lead the class in discussion and exercises afterward.
The vencedores study math, Spanish, history, geography, science and English, and must work together to do a community project, like building a staircase or planting a vegetable garden — that’s the part Caraballo guides.
Not only is school free but most of the students also receive stipends of $85 a month to attend.
The students themselves choose who gets the stipends, based on need and dedication.

Ribas is one of an ever-growing list of Chávez’s missions.
One teaches people to read.
Another has imported thousands of Cuban doctors and dispatched them to poor neighborhoods around the country.
Another set up stores in barrios that carry basic foodstuffs and medicines at highly subsidized prices.
Another provides identity cards to undocumented citizens.
The vast majority of the financing comes straight from Pdvsa.
The missions are popular and have benefited more than half of Venezuela’s poorest sector.
“It comes to our barrio,” one student said.

Spending oil money on schooling and doctors for the poor seems, intuitively, like the right thing to do.
“This is an investment in human capital,” argues Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning Washington policy group.
“You’ve had a focus on food and health care and education.
It doesn’t cost that much, and it’s reaching a lot of people.”

The Venezuelan who finishes high school with Misión Ribas may not have the same education she would get in a formal school.
But without Ribas, she would have no high-school education at all.
Chávez cares about reaching zero misery, something that can be said of few governments with oil.
But no one really knows if the missions are actually moving Venezuela toward zero misery; the programs have no visible internal evaluation.
Increasingly, the missions are replacing their formal counterparts.
It is wonderful for poor neighborhoods to have health clinics staffed with Cuban doctors — wonderful, unless you happen to need the services of one of Venezuela’s hospitals, which are falling apart.
Political and ideological training, Ribas officials told me, is the top qualification for a facilitator.
The referendum, to be held on Dec. 2, proposes changing the constitution to remove Chávez’s term limits and increase his power among other things.
She urged students to attend marches and street demonstrations supporting Chávez.
“Chávez is someone who comes along every 100 years,” she told them.
Afterward we rode down the mountain in a truck.

VIII.
Venezuela’s poor have become much less so under Chávez.
The population living in extreme poverty, measured by cash income, dropped from 20.3 percent in the last half of 1998 to 11.1 percent in the last half of 2006, according to official statistics.
But an oil boom might be expected to alleviate poverty.
The real question is whether the gains will be sustainable.
Weisbrot says he thinks they will.
He points to the missions and figures there are gains in health and education that cash income doesn’t measure.
But so far there is no sign of them: the percentage of those living without running water and living in inadequate housing, as well as the number of young children not attending school, has scarcely budged in the last 10 years.
And this is according to government statistics.
It is early, but these numbers may mean that the missions are mainly helping through the stipends.
Whatever success the missions have at helping the poor may be dwarfed by the grotesque distortions in the economy as a whole.
Inflation is officially at 16 percent but is most likely higher, according to Orlando Ochoa, the economist, who is usually critical of Chávez.
He says that in the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation, just under half the items are sold at government-controlled prices.
Many goods simply can’t be bought at those prices, and consumers must pay double the price in a street market.
Or the goods can’t be found at all, their producers forced out of business by price controls.
One proposal in Chávez’s constitutional referendum could increase inflation much further by abolishing the autonomy of the Central Bank and giving the president power over Venezuela’s international reserves.
The proposal would also essentially allow Chávez to print money.

The major threat to the economy comes from the exchange rate.
Farms and factories are in trouble.
They can’t export and must compete at home with products imported at the official exchange rate, which is now about a third of the market rate.
And so the country is awash in artificially cheap imported products, from basic foodstuffs, like Brazilian cooking oil, to fancy cars.
“Our productive capacity is too weak to create jobs,” Petkoff says.
“But we consume like a rich country.”
The disparity between the official exchange rate (2,150 bolívars to the dollar) and the black-market rate (6,200 bolívars at press time) has created a new class known as the Boliburgesía.
Bankers, traders, anyone who works in finance or commerce, can get very rich manipulating the exchange rates.
Buy all the imported whiskey and Hummers you want, is the message.
Live a life of wild excess.
Just don’t try to produce anything.
Even if the price of oil stays high, it may not be able to sustain Venezuela if oil production continues to drop, subsidized domestic consumption keeps rising and government spending continues unmeasured and unchecked.
While other oil producers, like Russia and Nigeria, are piling up surpluses, Venezuela is spending everything it gets.
Venezuela once had a $6 billion oil fund to be saved for lean years; Chávez has spent all but $700 million of it.
The vast majority of Chávez’s new missions and worker cooperatives are dependent on state handouts — unsustainable when government revenue falls.
A devaluation of the currency would wipe out the income gains of the poor.

This is classic oil curse, and Venezuela has seen it before.
Chávez has quite likely intensified these cycles, and the country is less able to produce anything other than oil.

Venezuela’s adventures in oil nationalization have produced two very different models.
But the new way has produced something arguably worse — economic failure despite a boom in oil prices, and it is unfair to future generations.
IX.
Nationalization is often a response to the failure of privatized oil to respond to the people’s needs.
Even in the United States, where there is a good chance of getting caught, oil companies have inflated their costs or illegally deducted costs and engaged in other machinations to minimize payouts.
For poor countries, the risks of getting a raw deal from private oil companies are much greater.
History is littered with contracts that give Big Oil obviously unfair advantages — Shell in Nigeria, Mobil in Kazakhstan and Texaco in Ecuador to name a few.
Oil can also be an irresistible seduction to a country’s ruling class.
Where democratic institutions — or even merely transparent processes — don’t exist, the lure to corruption is powerful.

Nationalization, however, doesn’t cure these ills, and it can deprive a nation of its rightful take of its natural wealth in other ways.
One is simply lack of know-how.
One reason President Evo Morales of Bolivia pulled back from his threats to radically nationalize the country’s gas industry is that Bolivian officials realize they cannot manage the business themselves.
Morales has focused on raising royalties on fields with known reserves, fields where companies essentially are guaranteed a return on investment.
Morales’s nationalization rhetoric, not royalty rates, made private companies skittish.
“There are intangible factors I can’t control, and it’s creating all this political risk.” Roger Tissot of PFC Energy adds: “Companies don’t have a problem paying more rent and taxes.
They do have a problem giving up control.”

So perhaps the best strategy for resource-rich countries is to keep the oil private, watch it carefully and tax the hell out of it.
Better yet, raise royalties, which are more straightforward and easier to collect.
“If your objective is to maximize rent, then the best way is to have companies compete with one another in open bidding for access,” Tissot says.
“Angola and Libya have done this very successfully.
Libya invited private companies to come back and is squeezing 90 percent of the profits out of them.”

As a slogan, “Negotiate a Better Royalty Rate!” doesn’t have the ring of “The Oil Is Ours!”; nationalization of natural resources can bolster a country’s psyche even if the management of those resources is a failure.
The urge to nationalize is, at its core, a political one.
Chávez seized Pdvsa not so it would produce more but so he could directly control the money.
When governments give into this urge, they tend to be susceptible to the temptations of using oil for short-term gain.
But not always.
Nationalized oil production doesn’t necessarily lead to political corruption or shortsightedness.
If the old Pdvsa were operating in today’s booming oil market, there might be plenty of money for investment in oil and social programs.
But it would be the government’s job to watch the company closely to make sure the state got its fair share — in other words, to ensure oil does what it should do: produce maximum sustainable money for the state.
It’s also the government’s job to use the money wisely.
That is a more important and difficult problem than the dilemma of whether to nationalize, and the solution does not depend on whether production is nationalized or privatized.
It is not even an oil problem at all.

All oil production ends up at some point in the realm of politics — whose interests will the bounty serve?
The only way to mitigate the political influence is transparency for state-owned and private companies alike.
“There should be a law that a national oil company has to publish its corporate figures, matching an S.E.C.
filing,” says Jaffe, the Baker Institute fellow.
“We recommend that there be a regulator in Parliament that requires full reporting.
And it should be open to the public.
It’s easy to say and hard to do.”

Private companies do release credible annual reports — but many of them never reveal what they pay host governments.
Several new nongovernmental campaigns, like Publish What You Pay and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, are trying to shame companies and governments into bringing the books out into the open.
So far they have had limited success.
“The problem isn’t who owns the resources, it’s what you get from the proceeds,” says David Mares, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego, who studies energy in Latin America.
“If you waste it in corruption and unsustainable programs, it’s as bad as if you have international corporations dominating, who pay very few taxes.”
Nationalization won’t keep oil from being stolen.
Good oversight, accountability and management of the funds will, no matter who owns the oil.
“Guess what?
But an examination by The New York Times shows that many of those goals went unfulfilled as the agency slowly collapsed under its own mismanagement, wasting money and failing to provide services.

And the city, Miracle Makers’ biggest client, shares some of the blame.
One of the largest of those organizations, Miracle Makers moved far beyond foster care to provide everything from doctors and drug treatment to housing for the homeless, serving more than 5,000 children and adults in 32 programs across Brooklyn and Queens, and building a national profile.
Yet the city let it continue for three and a half more years, feeding it additional millions as its evaluations remained dismal, its finances derailed and its children suffered.
For much of that time, the man with the ultimate say over the agency’s fate was Mr. Scoppetta’s successor, William C. Bell — a former top executive at Miracle Makers.

Today, Miracle Makers has lost most of its state and city contracts, though the city still pays it more than $7 million a year for day care and AIDS services.

Miracle Makers executives, past and present, denied any wrongdoing by the agency.
The son of an Alabama coal miner, he was cleaning subway cars at night and rehabilitating brownstones in the 1970s when he helped his Pentecostal church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, start a handful of thriving day care centers that eventually became The Miracle Makers Inc.

He had no experience in foster care when the city asked him to start taking neglected children in 1986.

Of all the new agencies, the city seemed especially impressed with one.
“Miracle Makers and Willie Wren, in particular, have indeed been justifying their name,” said a 1988 memo by Mr. Brettschneider’s successor, Brooke Trent.

Mr. Little, who has since died, said he was trying, in part, to save money.
“The city does not have the means to know what is happening in foster care,” he said in a news article.
“We’re heading for a serious crisis.”
The Board: On the Sidelines
If city officials would not hold Miracle Makers to strict account, someone else could: a seasoned, skeptical board of directors.

Yet for his board, Mr. Wren chose friends, church leaders and business associates — many of whom were devoted to the agency’s work but short on experience and independence.

“I don’t need to travel to Brooklyn to have chicken,” she recalls another new director saying.
“We’re not doing anything.”
While the board sat by, millions of dollars poured in, and the agency’s blue awnings popped up all over as it expanded into what Mr. Wren called “wraparound services” to bolster families: a program to work with parents to keep children out of foster care; help for AIDS patients; and housing for teenagers and the mentally retarded.
In 1997, records show, the city’s health department canceled a contract to provide housing and services for about 40 tuberculosis patients, saying Miracle Makers had failed to file fiscal reports or give required care.
The state’s health department had a more basic concern.
In 2000, after reviewing a report on Miracle Makers’ finances, it questioned whether the agency could survive another year.
“Please submit a plan to ensure continued solvency,” the department wrote.
“We turn into a multimillion-dollar agency overnight, with no additional training for the staff, no additional training for the management,” Ms. Johnson said.
“And if you look at the résumés of the people in place, you ask yourself, ‘Do these people run a $35 million corporation?’ Your answer is resoundingly: ‘No.
Hell, no.
They can barely balance their checkbook.’ ”
The City: Moment of Truth
The alarm sounded even louder in City Hall.
The team’s report, delivered to Mr. Wren and his board, was unsparing — a 35-page portrait of an organization riddled with fundamental flaws: huge caseloads, high turnover, a staff poorly trained and supervised, an agency too busy “putting out fires” to plan for children’s futures.
The team’s recommendations were blunt: The agency’s “aggressive expansion” must stop, and Mr. Wren must prepare to step down.
Mr. Wren, who criticizes the report today as superficial and inaccurate, left the agency nine months later.
would discontinue doing business with Miracle Makers,” he said.
Mr. Bell had worked at Miracle Makers for four years in the early 1990s, eventually overseeing foster care and other programs.
In November 2001, two months after the Courtney report’s harsh conclusions, he spoke at a Miracle Makers fund-raising dinner, praising Mr. Wren and tracing his own success to his days there.
“I stand here today,” he said, “really being a miracle of birth out of Miracle Makers.”
Mr. Bell declined several requests for an interview.
“There had to come a time when something has to be done.”

Miracle Makers’ board of directors, too, was eager for change — finding a successor to Mr. Wren to lead the agency in a new direction.
Mr. Wren, he said, “was astute enough to realize that he had to use elected officials who work within the area.”

Yet a year after Miracle Makers was told to file the necessary petition, the girl was still waiting, fearful that she might be taken from her loving foster mother or returned to her abusive father.
“I don’t want to go back home,” she pleaded in a letter to her Legal Aid lawyers.
By her reckoning, the girl could have been adopted eight or nine years earlier.

Finally, two lawyers working pro bono, David Baronoff and Andres Alvarez of Latham & Watkins, took the foster mother’s case from Miracle Makers, and completed the adoption in seven months.

Another strategy was delay.
Suppliers and other creditors kept calling, livid over not getting paid.
Bill Anderson, a former assistant director of foster care, recalled opening a desk drawer and finding a stack of undelivered checks totaling thousands of dollars: monthly allowances of up to $40 the city had allocated to help teenagers prepare for life on their own.
That summer, the city Human Resources Administration accused Miracle Makers of improperly using $366,000 from a human resources contract to pay other bills.
Still, the city made Miracle Makers surrender the contract.
The Mysteries: Dead Ends
As Miracle Makers imploded, forfeiting contracts and attracting more scrutiny, questions about the millions of dollars it had run through only multiplied.

But Referee Burnett was skeptical that Miracle Makers was even providing the girl with the one-on-one counseling.
At one point she demanded, “I want to see proof.”
The girl’s caseworker, Ms. Grant, arrived at the next hearing with a stack of papers — each dated and signed by the girl — that appeared to document her presence at numerous counseling sessions over two years.

Yet when questioned, the girl testified that she had signed the documents recently — all at once — at the orders of Ms. Grant.
Mr. Mattingly and his staff realized that what they were contemplating — all but ending a 20-year experiment in allowing minority agencies to care for many of the city’s thousands of abused or neglected black and Latino children — could be divisive, and they prepared themselves for the backlash.

The city’s evaluations had provoked genuine concern about just how well the agencies were protecting and providing for several thousand children.
They reflected problems across more than a dozen measures — from the levels of abuse in foster homes to adoption rates to how well the agencies kept track of whether children were being fed and clothed, attending school and receiving medical care.
Along with his review, Mr. Mattingly and his aides pledged to study the experiences of the city’s minority agencies, and to consider the recommendations of a task force he had set up to explore ways that such agencies could be preserved and supported.
“I am reasonably confident that we were in the position to make some judgments about quality of work.
And what we might do to save the good things while at the same time not jeopardizing quality.”

Making a Change
On the afternoon of May 16, 2005, about a dozen people convened in a conference room in the Park Avenue offices of the United Way of New York City, which provided grants, training and other support to minority foster care programs.

To some on the panel, his decision to place six of the city’s remaining eight minority agencies under review was brazen and insensitive.
“We do not believe that any foster care agency of color can be lost,” Ralph Dickerson Jr., then chairman of the Black Equity Alliance, wrote in the New York Nonprofit Press, an influential trade publication.
“My view was, you look at the performance of the agency, and you keep the agencies that are performing well,” he said.
Yet minority agencies argued that black and Latino children sometimes benefited from staying in stable long-term foster care with a relative, rather than being placed for adoption with a stranger.
That philosophical choice could cost an agency points.

“In this field, as in many other fields, numbers do not always tell the story,” said one task force member, Megan E. McLaughlin, former executive director of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, which has long offered training and other support to the minority agencies.
Some of the recommendations spurred debate among executives of the established organizations about their fairness.

Poul Jensen, president of one of the oldest agencies, Graham Windham, which has some 900 foster children, circulated a letter about 10 months ago to industry colleagues and to Mr. Mattingly in which he enthusiastically supported the task force’s recommendations.
But he opposed “a publicly financed special fund for this group.”

“In my view,” he wrote, “it would not be a good idea to treat minority agencies as a special, protected class so as ‘to insure that these agencies will survive.’”
He said the “public good will be best served” by fairly holding all agencies to account, and by having every agency try to incorporate the special benefits seen in well-run minority agencies.

“We were staffed by all these white women from Bowling Green University,” Mr. Mattingly recalled of the city’s child welfare operation.
He gave grant money to agencies in dozens of cities to help them develop a local system of care that would draw upon the wisdom and commitment of local communities.
Agencies, then, would have to close.
Still, he and his aides could not help but be uncomfortable even considering terminating Ms. Hart’s agency or any of the other minority operations.

“I am thinking of black and brown high school students brought into a predominantly white school through a program meant to encourage diversity, and then it turns out most of them are struggling and on academic probation,” she said.
“It’s not about giving them a pass, but wouldn’t you want to make sure they had the skills and resources to be competitive with their white counterparts?”
By May 2005, Mr. Mattingly had decided to continue the foster care contracts of five of the six minority agencies that had gone through reviews.

Later, he said he would try to put the task force’s recommendations in place.
An Uncertain Start
Today, some 2,400 children remain in the care of seven minority foster care agencies.
But more than two years since Mr. Mattingly formed his task force, its recommendation for better evaluating minority agencies has yet to be carried out.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The question of how to revamp the city’s performance scoring system for foster care agencies, in fact, is still the subject of study and debate among child welfare officials.

Some of that discussion has centered on the difficult question of how much to credit agencies for what is known in child welfare circles as “cultural competency.”
It can be a hard thing to define, and to measure.
At its most basic, it is an agency’s ability to bring a special understanding and sensitivity to the question of how different communities — black or Jewish, Latino or Russian — raise, discipline and provide for their children.

City officials concede that they are still struggling with questions as fundamental as how such intuitive skills can be measured in concrete, trustworthy ways.
Toward this end, they have sent out teams to investigate cases in which an agency has succeeded in this regard.
And they have hired a Hunter College professor as a consultant.
Mr. Mattingly is firm in his belief that cultural strengths can and must be measured.
His staff, though, still has not settled on how much cultural competency will count, especially when compared with critical measurements like safety and the ability to find permanent homes for children.

The other major recommendation of the task force — that the city create a public-private fund that would support minority agencies — also posed a problem because of questions about how the city could participate in a fund that gave grants exclusively to minority-led agencies.
One consultant, Eric Brettschneider, a child welfare official under Mayor Edward I. Koch, wrote to Mr. Mattingly that the city could define the fund’s potential beneficiaries not by their “status as a minority-governed” agency, but by other attributes that applied, like being “truly embedded in the community,” offering “culturally competent” services, and having leadership that reflected “the people that they serve.”
In the end, the city decided not to create or pay into a fund, but said it would provide a staff member to work at a fund administered by United Way of New York City.

Mr. Brettschneider, who now works at United Way, said the funding criteria are still being worked out, and the plan is to seek money from private, federal, and state sources.
Some private foundations have already contributed money, he said.

Recently, the fund made grants to several minority-led agencies, including some that had been under review by the city.
The grant was aimed at improving the agency’s ability to track and document the care children were receiving.

But the problems at Family Support still run deeper than such basic concerns.
The city, for instance, has met recently with lawyers for foster children in the Bronx who have been troubled by the agency’s handling of cases.

As for the city, a recent examination conducted by the Department of Investigation found substantial failings in the oversight of many foster care agencies, minority or otherwise.

The reason, he said, is a series of reforms he enacted this year that include sending teams of child welfare staff members into the agencies themselves to conduct checks and provide regular feedback.
This means, he says, that the city will identify and fix problems more quickly.
But Steven Banks, attorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society, whose lawyers represent 90 percent of the 30,000 children who appear in family court each year, said there was a “significant gulf between excellent policy initiatives by the city and the day-to-day realities of suffering by children and families in the foster care system.”
Mr. Mattingly said he would not be afraid to act.
“I don’t care who is running the agency or what the purpose of any program is, if you don’t do the basics, you can’t do the work,” he said.
“And I don’t back off that at all."
Without a market, where did those numbers come from?
Citi has disclosed something about that, and it sounds every bit as reliable as reading tea leaves.

First, you should understand the securities themselves.
The underlying source of payment is subprime mortgages, and that is a market where the outlook keeps getting worse.
But these securities are “super-senior” — a great salesman’s phrase — and will not suffer unless losses grow to extreme levels that wipe out the value of junior securities backed by the same loans.
The losses are not that high yet, or even close to it, but fear is rising.
So how can we estimate what the market price would be if there were a market?
To make that estimate, it had to guess what will happen to house prices.
The riskier it is, the higher the rate Citi should choose and the bigger the loss it should take.
Come to think of it, tea leaf reading may be more reliable.
The only actual market price Citi looked to came from what are called the ABX indexes, which do trade.
Investors can use them to buy protection from defaults on mortgage-backed securities, and they are trading as if real estate prices are likely to plunge and defaults soar.
Is that a reasonable estimate, or a reflection of panic?
Or both?

There is a temptation to think Citi’s write-offs are too high, given that they were announced just as Chuck Prince was being forced to walk the plank and step down as chief executive.
Taking a big hit when the old guy leaves is a traditional way to make the new guy’s tenure look better.
But there is no way to be sure.

For companies, that can get downright agonizing.
This week, Ambac, which has written insurance to protect investors in some C.D.O.’s, fired back.
One of Ambac’s complaints was that Mr. Zerbe did not give it enough credit for having insured not just paper based on the mortgages going bad — the ones written in 2006 and 2007 — but on the earlier mortgage pools that have shown fewer problems.
Unfortunately, even as the chief executive of another financial insurer, Dominic Frederico of Assured Guaranty, was complaining in a conference call about “the hysteria of the market,” analysts were going through the latest reports on pools of subprime mortgages.
Since the end of May, financial stocks are down 20 percent or more, while most other stocks have held their own.
At some point, financial stock valuations will fall so far that prices are ridiculously low.

Israel has declared Gaza a “hostile entity” and is moving to reduce its supplies of energy to the territory, while maintaining imports of essentials for life, hoping to put economic pressure on Hamas to stop constant rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel.
Gaza is thus isolated diplomatically and economically.
According to the United Nations, an average of 74 truckloads of goods a day entered Gaza in October, down from 253 truckloads a day in April.
The consequences have meant a shrinking economy coupled with a severe increase in prices even for basic foodstuffs like flour, cooking oil and chicken.

But Paul supporters have demonstrated how a handful of people can build them into a movement.
There are now more than 1,140 Paul meetup groups in 900 cities with more than 67,000 members.
The meetups have operated largely independently from the campaign, but like the campaign are moving their efforts from the Internet to the ground.

“The crux of the problem we have is that most of the public has not heard of Ron Paul yet,” said Jeff Gaul, 50, an Albany insurance broker and public adjustor, who bought a batch of Paul yard signs at his own expense and urged others at the Albany meetup to do so.
At the meetup — in an unadorned, dimly lighted coffeehouse — supporters spent two hours discussing ways to establish a greater physical presence, including creating and paying for their own radio advertisements for Mr. Paul and gathering signatures for a petition drive to get him on the New York State ballot.

Mr. Gould said he was alarmed about the nation’s currency, a favorite Paul topic.
Federal Reserve notes, Mr. Gould said, are “like a loan off of a loan that’s physically impossible to ever repay,” meaning the country “will continuously be in massive debt.”
Mr. Paul’s supporters seem prepared to push at least as far as he will, but how far he will go is not yet clear; he has waved off suggestions of a third-party candidacy.
“As long as there’s momentum, and if they’re starting another fund-raiser for me, how can I walk away?” Mr. Paul said in the interview.
But if the votes don’t materialize, he added, “after every primary, you’d have to have a bit of a reassessment.”

Though many economists see a gloomy outlook for spending, the Fed has hinted that it would be reluctant to cut its benchmark interest rate when the central bank meets on Dec. 11, discouraging market watchers who think a rate cut could stimulate growth.
But prices at the producer level were restrained last month, possibly reassuring Fed officials who are wary of inflation risks.
Businesses paid less for energy in October despite rising oil prices, though the recent run-up in crude oil prices could reverse that trend in November.

Just like banks, the SIVs borrowed short and lent long.
The spreads might be thin, but they could employ leverage to make narrow margins go a long way.
Now they are costing banks money to prop them up.

Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told investors this week that “SIVs don’t have a business purpose” and “will go the way of the dinosaur.” Will they take the securitization system with them?
The answer to that question may be crucial in determining how soon the financial system recovers.
The most important duty of the Federal Reserve is to preserve the health of the banking system.
In the early 1990s, after the last big crisis, it engineered a steep yield curve for years, helping banks to recover.
When the smoke clears, the Fed will try to do that again, even if it means significantly higher long-term interest rates.
Higher long-term rates are not what either debt-laden consumers or the depressed housing market really need, of course.
But such trade-offs are what come when big risks are taken, and ignored, for too long.
“A sequence of data releases consistent with the rough patch for economic activity that I expect in coming months would not, by themselves, suggest to me that the current stance of monetary policy is inappropriate,” he said.

Mr. Kroszner warned that the housing recession was likely to worsen and predicted weaker home sales and a cutback in consumer spending as mortgage rates rise and foreclosures increase.
“Conditions for subprime borrowers will get worse before they get better,” he said.
In his remarks, Mr. Kroszner warned against a series of consecutive rate cuts, suggesting such a move could set off inflation.
“All else equal, each successive action in the same direction tends to lower the incremental benefits and to raise the incremental costs of additional actions,” he said.

Mr. Kroszner’s comments came as the government released a surprisingly weak report on industrial production.
The weak dollar has kept domestic business activity growing as foreign demand increases, but the report suggested companies are taking a more conservative stance, lowering inventories in anticipation of a spending slowdown.
“Exports can only take you so far,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm.
“I think we’re starting to see the evidence pile up of the effects of weaker domestic demand.” He added, “There doesn’t seem to be much reason for optimism, with housing continuing to decline.”

Today, risk has shifted from a bet on what nature will provide to an intricate series of bets on what other players in the economy will decide — and how each will respond to the others’ decisions.
Instead of a throw of the dice, economic activity has become an intense interchange among companies, employees, suppliers, customers, owners, borrowers, lenders and financiers.
The interaction has become more complex over time, so the answers to the above questions will in turn provoke new questions, answers and decisions among these groups.
Most important, the essence of risk itself has been fundamentally transformed.
Risk today depends upon the consequences of what somebody else will do, not on what God or nature will provide.
Risk management means protecting oneself from the adverse and unexpected decisions others may make and, in the process, making better decisions than they do.

David Brooks is right about one thing: American music today is increasingly fragmented.
But he seems to have missed the real reasons why.

Modern recording technologies allow virtually anyone to record music and make it available to listeners worldwide, a privilege once enjoyed exclusively by large record companies.
As a result, major record companies have increasingly less control over what gets heard, while consumers have increasingly more.
It should surprise no one that in an environment of almost unlimited consumer freedom we would end up with a wider variety of preferences than those prearranged by a few record executives.
As a guitar teacher, I see teenage kids today who have more artists in their iPods than I would have ever known to exist when I was their age.

THE Federal Reserve Board forecast this week that there will be no recession in the United States in the foreseeable future.
It says the gross domestic product will grow by as little as 1.6 percent in 2008, but is confident that growth will accelerate after that.
The number of new homes being built is now little more than half the level of two years ago.
If the Fed is right, and the economy does stay out of recession, with the unemployment rate barely rising at all, then it will be the first time ever that a housing slowdown this severe has not coincided with a recession.
In fact, there has never been a slowdown of anything like this magnitude until after a recession was under way.

A tiny yet transcendent moment, one among many such moments of recaptured pleasures and newfound problems since his exoneration and release from prison last autumn.
Still trying to recover what was stolen from him, he is, at 34, a free man who has yet to feel truly free.
At least 205 men and one woman nationwide have been exonerated through DNA evidence since 1989, including 53 who, like Mr. Deskovic, were convicted of murder.
In gathering information on 137 of them over the past four months — one of the most extensive such efforts to date — The New York Times found that many faced the same challenges Mr. Deskovic has confronted, like making a living, reconnecting with relatives and seeking financial recompense for his lost years.

For six months, Mr. Deskovic got by on $137 a month in disability checks and $150 in food stamps from the federal government, carrying cans of tuna in his backpack.
Now earning money through speeches and newspaper columns about wrongful conviction, Mr. Deskovic paid rent for the first time in his life in August, for a cozy attic apartment in Tarrytown that the county subsidizes because of his depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

While he was locked up, Ms. McGarr was Mr. Deskovic’s connection to the outside world (he has never known his father).
Like many of those men, he had maintained his innocence since shortly after the confession, proclaiming at his sentencing hearing: “I didn’t do anything.”

Seeking to reassure banks amid the continuing credit crisis, the Federal Reserve said yesterday that it would provide $8 billion in funds to ease concerns about lending during the holiday season.
The $8 billion — essentially a low-interest loan to the nation’s banks — will be issued Wednesday and repaid Jan. 10.
The 43-day loan period is the longest in three years for this type of year-end injection.
While it is not an unusual step for the Fed, the injection usually takes place later in the fourth quarter and involves a smaller amount.
Wall Street’s reluctance to lend can be intensified during the holiday season, as consumers demand more money for spending and banks look to close out their yearly balance sheets with a generous amount of capital and investments in safe-haven securities like Treasuries.
This year, anxiety about the ailing credit market has made banks more hesitant to provide their peer institutions with overnight loans, a crucial component of the nation’s economic bloodstream.
(Libor is the London interbank offered rate, basically what banks pay on loans to each other.)

The demise of this deal — known as a constant proportion debt obligation is emblematic of what is happening to the financial system in the credit collapse of 2007.
The financial engineers persuaded people that big risks could be financed mostly through safe investments.
The ready availability of that financing encouraged more risks to be taken by lenders.
Easy credit meant borrowers could pay off old loans with new loans, and thus seemed to make the risks lower.
In retrospect, it was inevitable this would blow up.
It was not inevitable that the first problems would be in subprime mortgages.
But a system that encouraged more and more risky lending, with less and less concern about credit quality, could not endure forever.

The most important question for the markets now is this: With the theory of riskless risky lending thoroughly discredited, where will new financing come from?
The buyers of AAA paper have learned their lesson, and the flow of money has dried up.

One possibility is government guarantees.
Guarantees by government-sponsored enterprises back the securities financing most new mortgages now, and Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has suggested providing a direct government guarantee for some large mortgages.

The other possibility is to go back to the banking system, which would make loans it intended to hold, rather than to package and sell.
That would mean “going back to the 1980s model, rather than the 21st-century model,” as one financial engineer put it privately to me this week.

But that would require banks to have enough capital to make and keep more loans, and the losses now being taken are cutting into that capital.
Wall Street preaches that there is such a thing as “optimal leverage.” In that worldview, too much capital depresses a bank’s return on capital and is, therefore, as bad as too little.
Fearing they would have too much capital, banks bought their own stock at high prices, benefiting shareholders who were fleeing.
Now they must sell shares at low prices.
Kathleen Shanley, a bond analyst at Gimme Credit, points out that in 2005 and 2006 Citigroup spent almost $20 billion buying back stock at an average price of about $47 a share.
Now it is raising $7.5 billion from Abu Dhabi on terms that pay the Mideast nation 11 percent a year for three years.
Abu Dhabi will end up with stock purchased at prices of $31.83 to $37.24.
Buy high, sell low.

At least that deal assures that Citigroup will have adequate capital if it must report further losses from bad loans.
Wells Fargo, a well-capitalized competitor, announced this week that it would unload $11.9 billion in home equity loans that it probably should not have purchased to begin with.
It is taking a $1.4 billion reserve against losses.
That is more than 11 percent of their face value.
Some banks would run out of capital long before they could take comparable write-offs, a fact that places more pressure on those banks to raise capital at a time when investors are already worried.
Banks with capital concerns are not eager to make many new loans.

Much of the discredited “21st-century model” was aimed at finding ways to make loans without tying up capital.
Now capital is crucial again.
Unfortunately, there may not be enough of it to finance all the loans needed to keep the economy growing.
At the other end, Jones draped himself over Michael Redd, one of the game’s premier shooters, and harassed him into missing a 3-point attempt.

James L. Dolan, the Garden chairman, was not there to hear any of it.
While acknowledging Hamet was strict, distant and disapproving of his son’s early passion for dancing, Kavanagh tries, somewhat unpersuasively, to cast doubt on the charge that he was abusive.
“Other family members find this hard to believe,” she writes, and quotes one childhood friend saying he never saw Hamet beating or swearing at Rudolf.
Family and friends are always so reliable in matters like these.
Arriving at age 17, Nureyev was not as well trained as his classmates, and his sense of inadequacy fed a fanaticism about class that never left him.
I remember watching him at the School of American Ballet decades later, always with a woolen cap on his head to keep the heat in the furnace, standing at the barre with such focused concentration that his tendu almost seared the floor, making him the center of the room.
He was possessed, lacking the filter of self-possession coveted by most dancers.

Taken into the home of the celebrated teacher Alexander Pushkin and his dancer wife, Xenia, he was coddled and educated in all things theatrical.

agents guarding him and toward two undercover French policemen who were waiting.
Kavanagh cites a chilling K.G.B.
file from 1962 discussing methods to lessen Nureyev’s “professional skills,” including directives to “break one or both” of his legs.
Within months of his defection he was dancing everywhere, and the rest really is history — the history of an equally greedy and generous artist.
The list of where and with whom he danced is a who’s who of ballet in the mid-20th century.

Eight months after his defection, they danced together for the first time, in “Giselle” — then in everything, with Ashton’s “Marguerite and Armand” (based on “La Dame aux Camélias” by Dumas fils) defining them forever.
Thus began a partnership that will be remembered as perhaps the greatest in all dance history, not least for its erotic Oedipal overtones.
Dame Margot Fonteyn was aristocratic, beautiful, enamored of her young lion, with a profound passion lurking behind the ladylike exterior — and, at 42, old enough to be his mother.
Audiences treated them like rock stars, waiting in lines for days for tickets, scalping them at record prices and showering them with more than 20 curtain calls a performance.
“She has gone,” he wrote, “to the grand ball with a gigolo.”

After hours, Nureyev was to be found in the company of Jackie Onassis, Lee Radziwill, Andy Warhol, Richard Avedon (who shot a famous nude of him), Mick Jagger, Marlene Dietrich (“that boy,” she called him) and Peter O’Toole.
The starving son of Farida and Hamet could never get enough of anything — space, applause, money, sex.

Offstage his conduct was unbecoming.
His misbehavior, unsurprisingly, was often of the physical variety: punching (he was sued for cracking a teacher’s jaw), kicking, throwing and spitting, along with cursing and refusing anything he didn’t like — food, costumes, partners, tempos, choreography.
He was totally unpleasant, yet totally charming, the old contradictory makeup of many illustrious artists and hooligans.
Nureyev was the Brando of ballet, a solipsistic brute, an especially unusual character in a profession where obedience to a higher order and good manners are central to the art itself.

Kavanagh also documents, in equal detail, Nureyev’s very, very busy sex life.
He slept with a number of women — the jury remains out on Fonteyn (many think yes, many think no, she said no, he said yes ... and no) — and liked on occasion to claim, erroneously, to have impregnated a few.

Both dreams were, in their fashion, fulfilled, but be careful, as they say, what you wish for.
He called Bruhn, a brooding Dane 10 years his senior, the love of his life — “he’s so cold he’s like ice; you touch it and it burns you.” Their affair was marked by intense love, relentless competition, long distances and other lovers.
Kavanagh reproduces, at length, some of Bruhn’s tormented love letters, and while moving in their misery they do the sensitive dancer, writing in a language not his own, no service.
“My dearest and only one Human in the world,” he wrote, “You are the esense the focuse off all my world take my life if you want you so dear to me.
But this wasn’t really Balanchine’s style.
“When you are tired of playing at being a prince,” Balanchine famously told him, “come to me.” But the poor Tatar boy never tired of being the prince, and therein lies the essence of why these two huge figures in 20th-century ballet, from the same mother, the Kirov, were never to merge onstage.
More!
What are you waiting for?” — they represented polar opposites in terms of ethics and thus aesthetics.
He feels human.
But in between, when he was a meteor shattering all expectations onstage and off, and something definitely beyond human, the biography becomes a somewhat leaden laundry list of his prodigious comings and goings.
The book reads more like the biography of a celebrity than an artist, and they are not the same thing.
An artist has, in addition to the expensive houses and the tantrums, an emanation that is his art.

Finally, Kavanagh’s meticulous reporting of the adolescent antics and the transgressive sex life ends up overpowering any discussion of Nureyev’s art, demonstrating one of the perpetual difficulties of writing about dance and its practitioners.
It is near impossible (unless you are Paul Valéry or Edwin Denby) to render the three dimensions of a dancer’s performance, however transcendent, as convincingly or dramatically as a dancer’s bad behavior in the wings.
“Rudolf projected a powerful physical allure,” Kavanagh writes of his performance in “The Sleeping Beauty,” “most apparent in the hunting scene, where beplumed and bedecked in lace and satin, he stalked the stage with real aristocratic command.”
So if you want the dish, you will not be disappointed.
And if you want long, literal summaries of various ballets and choreography — including Nureyev’s own, much of which was of dubious value (Arlene Croce called him “a choreographer of staggering incompetence”) — you will find this too.
You will also find some delightful nuggets from those who knew Nureyev.
“He has a marvelous engine inside him, like a Rolls-Royce,” Frederick Ashton said.
“I feel he’s a mixture of a Tartar, a faun and a kind of lost urchin.
He’s the Rimbaud of the Steppes.” But amid all the reportage Kavanagh offers little of her own illumination of his genius, and amongst the foliage, the great sequoia is lost.

Furthermore, Kavanagh’s fondness for unattributed quotations makes for awkward reading.
In addition to forcing readers to keep one thumb embedded in the endnotes, the practice undermines her authorial voice.
“For a dancer who embodied freedom, bringing its ‘large, magical aura’ with him onstage,” she writes on one occasion, “it was only natural that he would want to ‘crash the gates’ between ballet and modern dance.” (The first quotation is from Arlene Croce, the second from the “Gruen transcript” — meaning either Nureyev himself or John Gruen, Erik Bruhn’s biographer, said it.)
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
There are also some notable omissions, despite Kavanagh’s nearly 800 pages.
She offers no follow-up of events after his death concerning his family’s legal battles with his foundations, the much publicized auctions of his estate or the outcry by prominent AIDS activists after his death that in concealing his H.I.V.
And I was puzzled by her mere parenthetical aside, among the numerous performances she documents, of Nureyev’s famous 1978 appearance on “The Muppet Show.” His pas de deux with a giant pig in “Swine Lake” is only the enticing warm-up for the pièce de résistance: his scene in the steam bath, in a towel, with an understandably amorous Miss Piggy.
(Go to YouTube for the denouement.)
In his final years, Nureyev insisted on literally, excruciatingly, dying before our eyes, giving performances so ragged and inept that audiences whistled and demanded refunds — which suggests something besides simple flouting of the cardinal rule that performers should know when to retire gracefully.
He demanded, somehow, that we see the suffering human behind the Dionysian god.
He was found one day, by Carla Fracci, lying on the floor in an echo of his childhood, sleeping on one of his kilim carpets and eating potatoes.
By the end of Kavanagh’s sad book, he feels like the loneliest man in the world.

“They pay us,” Nureyev once said, “for our fear.” Sure, vanity, self-indulgence and cruelty ran rampant throughout his short, tempestuous life.
Great dancing, unlike good dancing, is an experience of beauty laced with pity, a haunted happening in the shadow of our transience.
Dancers are willing slaves to the time and gravity that rule us all, and dancing is mortality in motion.
But liquidity has been drying up.
Some credit markets have effectively closed up shop.
Interest rates in other markets — like the London market, in which banks lend to each other — have risen even as interest rates on U.S. government debt, which is still considered safe, have plunged.

“What we are witnessing,” says Bill Gross of the bond manager Pimco, “is essentially the breakdown of our modern-day banking system, a complex of leveraged lending so hard to understand that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke required a face-to-face refresher course from hedge fund managers in mid-August.”
The freezing up of the financial markets will, if it goes on much longer, lead to a severe reduction in overall lending, causing business investment to go the way of home construction — and that will mean a recession, possibly a nasty one.
Behind the disappearance of liquidity lies a collapse of trust: market players don’t want to lend to each other, because they’re not sure they’ll be repaid.

In a direct sense, this collapse of trust has been caused by the bursting of the housing bubble.

Thus, “super-senior” claims against subprime mortgages — that is, investments that have first dibs on whatever mortgage payments borrowers make, and were therefore supposed to pay off in full even if a sizable fraction of these borrowers defaulted on their debts — have lost a third of their market value since July.

The answer is “financial innovation” — two words that should, from now on, strike fear into investors’ hearts.
O.K., to be fair, some kinds of financial innovation are good.
I don’t want to go back to the days when checking accounts didn’t pay interest and you couldn’t withdraw cash on weekends.
But the innovations of recent years — the alphabet soup of C.D.O.’s and S.I.V.’s, R.M.B.S.
and A.B.C.P.
They were promoted as ways to spread risk, making investment safer.
What they did instead — aside from making their creators a lot of money, which they didn’t have to repay when it all went bust — was to spread confusion, luring investors into taking on more risk than they realized.

Why was this allowed to happen?
At a deep level, I believe that the problem was ideological: policy makers, committed to the view that the market is always right, simply ignored the warning signs.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And free-market orthodoxy dies hard.
Just a few weeks ago Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, admitted to Fortune magazine that financial innovation got ahead of regulation — but added, “I don’t think we’d want it the other way around.” Is that your final answer, Mr. Secretary?
Now, Mr. Paulson’s new proposal to help borrowers renegotiate their mortgage payments and avoid foreclosure sounds in principle like a good idea (although we have yet to hear any details).
Realistically, however, it won’t make more than a small dent in the subprime problem.

I have for two years advocated diplomatic engagement with Iran, and I think that’s what the president should do.
He should seize this opportunity and engage in serious diplomacy, using both carrots and sticks.
I think we do know that pressure on Iran does have an effect.
I think that is an important lesson.
But we’re not going to reach the kind of resolution that we should seek unless we put that into the context of a diplomatic process.

They should have stopped the saber rattling; should have never started it.
And they need, now, to aggressively move on the diplomatic front.

I have said consistently, since the beginning of this campaign, that it is important for the president to lead diplomatic efforts, to try to offer to Iran the prospect of joining the World Trade Organization, potential normalized relations over time, in exchange for changes in behavior.
That’s something that has to be pursued.

MODERATOR: Senator Chris Dodd?
DODD: Well, again, this is 16 agencies that have drawn this conclusion.
It wasn’t just one.
So it’s a very compelling case that’s been made here for exercising caution in pursuing what I’ve advocated and others have as well, and that is pursuing as much of a diplomatic solution to the problems that Iran poses -- and there are some.
It would be foolish to say otherwise here.
But the important point is we can’t do this unilaterally.
If we merely try to impose sanctions by ourselves, or other such efforts here, they will fail.
It’s very important to understand the linkage, obviously, not only between Iran, but Iraq and Iran, and our ability to build this kind of international support for efforts to convince Iran on a variety of issues to move in a different direction is being seriously compromised by our continued military presence in Iraq.

Since that resolution passed, which was nonbinding and did not in any way authorize the president to take any action that would lead to war, our commanders on the ground in Iraq have announced that we’ve seen some progress from the Iranians backing off; no longer sending in weapons and materiel and beginning to withdraw their technical advisers.

If that doesn’t work, we really have to consider military action to stop them from doing it, perhaps by striking the bases around Tehran where we know they are training these Iraqi terrorists who go back to kill Americans.

MODERATOR: Senator Edwards, why not?
EDWARDS: Well, first of all, diplomacy -- declaring a military group sponsored by the state of Iran a terrorist organization, that’s supposed to be diplomacy?

And I would add, this has to be considered in the context that -- Senator Clinton has spoken about me; let me just respond -- this has to be considered in the context that Senator Clinton has said she agrees with George Bush terminology that we’re in a global war on terror, then she voted to declare a military group in Iran a terrorist organization.
What possible conclusion can you reach other than we are at war?
MODERATOR: Senator Clinton, your reply?
And then we’ll hear from Senator Gravel.
EDWARDS: And so I have a very -- very different view about what you need to do to stand up to Bush.

MODERATOR: We’ll have a response from Senator Clinton and then Mike Gravel.
CLINTON: Well, I understand politics, and I understand making outlandish political charges, but this really goes way too far.

In fact, having designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization, we’ve actually seen some changes in their behavior.
There is absolutely no basis for a rush to war, which I oppose and have opposed for two years.
But there is also a recognition that the Iranians were supplying weapons that killed Americans, they were supplying technical assistance from the Quds Force, which is their special operations element.
So I think we’ve actually seen the positive effects of having labeled them a terrorist organization because it did change their behavior.

MODERATOR: Mike Gravel, then Joe Biden.
GRAVEL: There is no evidence.
There is no evidence.
GRAVEL: And they’ve produced none.
Our military has no evidence and they’ve not produced any.
But let’s -- I want to touch something that they’re all giving license to; that there’s something wrong with Iran supporting Hamas and Hezbollah.

These are two elected organizations.
And why can’t they give support to those organizations?
Israel doesn’t want it.
So why do they buy, hook, line and sinker, that they can’t give aid to Hamas and Hezbollah?
We give unlimited aid to Israel.
These people are fighting for their rights.
MODERATOR: You -- you believe...
GRAVEL: Is there something wrong with that?
MODERATOR: We’ll come back to your points in a moment.

BIDEN: No, I wanted to talk about this issue.
As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I’m the only one at this table -- for the last four years, I’ve been laying out concrete alternatives to the Bush administration’s policy.
The vote -- what everybody misunderstands, in my humble opinion, is the vote to declare the Quds Force and the Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization was not a view that could be established without question, number one.

Number two, it is self-defeating.

BIDEN: With all due respect to my colleagues, with the exception of Senator Dodd, they’re not connecting the dots here.

MODERATOR: Senator Barack Obama?
Now, this is a problem on a whole bunch of fronts.
But number one, the reason that Iran has been strengthened was because of this misguided war in Iraq.
And so, the notion, somehow, that they’re not going to have influence and that we may be using yet another justification for a continuing mission in Iraq, I think, is an extreme problem and one of the reasons why this was a bad idea.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
MODERATOR: Senator Edwards?
EDWARDS: I just want to be clear to the listeners that we have a real division here.
I mean, among the Democratic candidates, there’s only one that voted for this resolution.
And this is exactly what Bush and Cheney wanted.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
EDWARDS: Second, there is a clear path for America on Iran.
They’ve got a president, Ahmadinejad, who is unpopular in own country.
We have the capacity to work with our European allies and the European banking system to put a proposal of stick and carrots on the table that actually will help influence their behavior.
The Iranian people, in many ways, do not support this guy.
And they’re looking for a path.
We need to help provide that path by making a serious proposal with our friends in Europe of sticks and carrots to help them with their economy.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
MODERATOR: Senator Clinton, and then another question.
CLINTON: I think, first of all, it’s important to recognize the Ahmadinejad does not control the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
They are directly controlled from the clerical leadership and the supreme leader.
And, in fact, because we have not engaged in diplomacy, we are quite unsure about what exactly goes on inside of Iran, which is one of the reasons why I’ve advocated diplomatic efforts for two years.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
If we were to engage in such diplomatic efforts, because of the enmeshment of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the economic activity of Iran, I believe these economic sanctions, as part of diplomacy, would be an advantage going in to those diplomatic efforts.
I have the greatest respect for my friend and colleague, Joe Biden.
He and I just respectfully disagree about this.
But I think that the important issues is that this is something that we have strong feelings about.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
CLINTON: But none of us is advocating a rush to war.
I have been against that.
I was the first of anyone at this table to go to the floor of the Senate, speak against the possibility that Bush could take us to war in Iran, back in February.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And I think that we have two different ways of approaching this.
Our goals are the same: diplomatic engagement with Iran.
MODERATOR: Iran’s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thrives on anti-Americanism.
One of our listeners, Ray Conrad, from Keosauqua, Iowa, who, incidentally, has made campaign contributions to Senator Edwards and also to Senator Biden, sent us a question about that.
And he put it this way: Clearly, many Muslims hate the U.S. enough to want to do us grievous harm.
Would you speculate on the reasons for their hatred of us?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Senator Biden, why?
BIDEN: By the way, terminology matters.
I’m a great admirer of Senator Clinton.
It’s not about not advocating a rush to war.
I’m advocating no war.
A rush to war means that war, taken slowly, going slowly, is possible.
I’m advocating no war, no justification for war.
Number two.
MODERATOR: Take military off the table, you would say.
BIDEN: The reason why -- the reason why we are disliked so much is because we are trusted so little.
The reason why we are disliked so much, obviously -- I’m not talking about Al Qaida, I’m talking about the 1.2 billion Muslims in the world who look at us, and when we say and do things as we’re talking about now with Iran, conclude that this is a war on Islam.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
BIDEN: I’ll make one point.
When we do things that don’t sound rational to them, it undercuts our legitimacy, we have no legitimacy.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
MODERATOR: Let me put this to Senator Edwards first, and then others.
When we do things that policymakers in Washington may think are rational, like very strong support of Israel, that also upsets a lot of those 1 billion Muslims you’ve described.

How would you, Senator Edwards, how would you as president, Senator Edwards, answer the complaint that the U.S., in its support of Israel, is so pro-Israeli it can’t be an evenhanded, honest broker of matters and is anti-Muslim?
EDWARDS: Well, first of all, I think that what’s driving this belief about America in the Muslim community around the world is the bullying, selfish, abusive behavior of George Bush and this administration.
I do want to go back to one quick point.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
We know what’s happening inside Iran.
We know a great deal about what’s happening.
We know, for example, that Ahmadinejad’s candidates in the election this -- December about a year ago got clobbered.
We know that there’s serious political -- lack of political support for this man.
And we have a huge wedge there that’s available to America.
But as to the Muslim community, I think that the most important thing for America to do is to demonstrate that we have a responsibility, not just to ourselves, but to humanity, and to help make education available, to fight global poverty.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
EDWARDS: We need to take serious steps to demonstrate that America is actually worthy of leadership.
MODERATOR: Senator Obama?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
OBAMA: Well, I think John’s point is right, but I want to broaden it a little bit.
Listen to the Republican candidates’ debates and how they frame this issue.
And if you are a Muslim overseas, listening to Rudy Giuliani say, they are coming here to try to kill you, which is the tenor of many of the speeches that are delivered by the Republican candidates, you would get an impression that they are not interested in talking and resolving issues peacefully.
Now, what we need to do is we need to close Guantanamo.
We need to restore habeas corpus.
We need to send a strong signal that we are going to talk directly to, not just our friends, but also to our enemies.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And I have to say that, when I brought this up early on in this campaign, I was called naive and irresponsible.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And yet -- yet, the point -- the reason for that was not necessarily because we’re going to change Ahmadinejad’s mind.
It’s because we’re going to change the minds of people inside Iran, moderate forces inside Iran, as well as our Muslim allies around the region, that we are willing to listen to them and try to engage in finding ways to resolve conflicts cooperatively.
MODERATOR: Senator Christopher Dodd?
DODD: Well, this is long-standing.

This has been a vacuum for a long time, in terms of our relationship with the Muslim world -- the 22 countries in the world that are Muslim nations.
We’ve been, basically, AWOL dealing with these nations here and that has bred a lack of understanding and appreciation -- the point I think that Barack was trying to make here.
But also, over these last six years, despite this effort over the last few days in Annapolis, where has this administration been on the Middle East issues here?
They are connected in many ways here.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
It appears, definitely, that we’re sort of -- just that we’re not engaged at all.
Over the past years, both Republican and Democratic administrations have made it a part of their agenda to stay engaged, to make it clear that we’re an honest broker trying to resolve the issue of Israel’s security, as well as the legitimate issue of Palestinians seeking an independent state.
We’ve walked away from that.
And that -- that absence of our participation, as well as our failure to understand and to try and have a better for what the culture of the Muslim world is, I think, has created the very environment you talked about.

MODERATOR: Last word on this topic from Dennis Kucinich.
KUCINICH: Thank you.
To answer your question directly, we need to reach out to Muslim nations and to tell them America is taking a different direction.

KUCINICH: No more unilateralism, preemption, first strike.
We’re going to -- our policy will be strength through peace.
That’s not being discussed in any of the analysis yet, but I’m here to say it.
We need to protect and provide for the security of Israel, and to make sure that the Palestinians can have a state.
And it has to be done under circumstances where the security of all parties and the civil rights and human rights of all parties are protected.

MODERATOR: Well, this question comes from a listener.
It’s a political science professor, Chris Pence of Marion, Indiana.

QUESTION: American diplomatic history books recount the Monroe Doctrine, the Truman Doctrine and will likely discuss the Bush doctrine.
When future historians write of your administration’s foreign policy pursuits, what will be noted as your doctrine and the vision you cast for U.S. diplomatic relations?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
MODERATOR: Time for a couple of you at least.
Senator Clinton, what do you think the Clinton doctrine will be?
CLINTON: Well, it will be a doctrine of restoring America’s leadership and moral authority through multilateral organizations, through attempts to come to agreements on issues ranging from global warming to stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other dangerous weapons.
CLINTON: It will be a doctrine that demonstrates that the United States is not afraid to cooperate; that through cooperation in our inter-dependent world, we actually can build a stronger country and a stronger world that will be more reflective of our values.
MODERATOR: Thank you, Senator Clinton.
The Edwards doctrine?
EDWARDS: The Edwards doctrine will be longer-term , visionary; not the kind of ad hoc foreign policy -- foreign policy of convenience that we’ve seen over the last seven years, but instead, looking at not only the short-term issues that American and the world faces -- I’ve talked about Iran; Pakistan; what’s happening with North Korea; we’re about to talk about China -- but also to think about what is it that America does over the long-term to strengthen not only our leadership role, but our ability to provide stability.
And the key to that is for America both through our actions and through our language from the president of the United States to demonstrate that we respect people who grow up in different cultures with different faith beliefs, that we respect people who have a different perspective than we do and we intend to lead , but to work with those people, and for America, whereas education, health, et cetera, to meet its responsibility to humanity.
MODERATOR: And, Senator Biden, the Biden doctrine?
BIDEN: Clarity.
Prevention, not preemption.
An absolute repudiation of this president’s doctrine which has only three legs on the stool.
One, push the mute button, don’t talk to anybody.
Two, preemption.
And three, regime change.
I would reject all three.
We need a doctrine of prevention.
The role of a great power is to prevent the crises.
And we don’t have to imagine any of the crises.
We know what’s going to happen on day one when you’re president.
You have Pakistan, Russia, China, the subcontinent of India.
You have Afghanistan.
You have Darfur.
And it requires engagement, engagement and prevention.
That does not rule out the use of force.
It incorporates the notion of prevention.
Prevention.
MODERATOR: Senator Obama, the short version of the Obama doctrine?
OBAMA: Well, I think one of the things about the Obama doctrine is it’s not going to be as doctrinaire as the Bush doctrine, because the world is complicated.
And I think part of the problem we’ve had is that ideology has overridden facts and reality.
But I think the basic concept, and I’ve heard it from some of the other folks, is that increasingly we have to view our security in terms of a common security and a common prosperity with other peoples and other countries.
And that means that if there are children in the Middle East who cannot read, that is a potential long-term danger to us.
If China is polluting, then eventually that is going to reach our shores.
We have to work with them cooperatively to solve their problems as well as ours.
MODERATOR: And we will continue our debate from Des Moines in just a minute.
MODERATOR: We’re broadcasting from Des Moines, Iowa.
And in this part of the debate, we’re going to focus on a changing China and its effects here at home.
MODERATOR: We’ll talk about the economic power of China and what it means for U.S. consumers, U.S. workers, and the American financial system.
We’ll also hear about the strategic challenges China presents, its huge military buildup, its enormous appetite for natural resources, its environmental record.
And we’ll also cover human rights, we hope, and China’s growing influence in the world.
MODERATOR: And that’s where we’d like to start.
And I’d like to pose a question to many of you.
Given China’s size, its muscular manufacturing capabilities, its military buildup, at this point -- and also including its large trade deficit -- at this point, who has more leverage, China or the U.S.?
And I’m going to begin with you, Senator Edwards.
EDWARDS: I think that what’s happened with the last seven years of the Bush administration is America’s faced, over the long term, with two very serious challenges, one of which they’ve been obsessed with, which is the issue of terrorism.
The other is the rise and strength of China, which they’ve done virtually nothing about, on any front, I mean, ranging from China sending dangerous toys into the United States to our trade relationship with China to, as Robert just mentioned, their buildup of their military, which they’re doing opaquely.
We know very little about what they’re actually doing.
On top of that, they’re obsessed with their own internal economic development.
And that results in them propping up bad regimes like Sudan, like Iran.
They’re doing incredible damage to the environment.
So the answer to the question is -- America continues to have serious economic leverage with the Chinese and diplomatic leverage with the Chinese.
MODERATOR: Who has more leverage?
EDWARDS: Well, I think that’s -- what we know is they’re growing, they’re strong.
I think America’s stronger today.
And if we deal with these issues and we deal with them in a serious way across the board, and we engage on these issues -- which we have not been doing and we see the consequences for American children right now, with these dangerous lead-filled toys coming into the United States, with this extraordinary trade deficit that we have, the growing of their military.
We see them propping up genocide in western Sudan and Darfur, with their economic development there.
American must engage the Chinese on all of these issues.
MODERATOR: All right, we’ll get to that question of product safety in just a minute.
First, Senator Obama.
OBAMA: Well, there are three issues that we have to deal with.
Number one, is we’ve got to get our own fiscal house in order.
Our leverage is weakening when we run up enormous deficits funding a war that should have never been authorized.
And we then are taking out the credit card with the Chinese.
That gives us less leverage.
Number two, when I was visiting Africa, I was told by a group of businessmen that the presence of China is only exceeded by the absence of America in the entire African continent.
And it indicates the unwillingness of our administration to think strategically about other counties beyond the war on terror.
OBAMA: Number three, we have to be tougher negotiators with China.
They are not enemies, but they are competitors of ours.
And on the economic front, on trade issues, on issues importation, we have not been the best negotiators.
And oftentimes, we’re negotiating on behalf of Wall Street, as opposed to on behalf of Main Street.
MODERATOR: I heard you say less leverage.
Who has more leverage at this point?
OBAMA: Well, right now, the United States is still the dominant superpower in the world.
But we have to -- the next president can’t be thinking about today; he or she also has to be thinking about 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 50 years from now.
And if we continue on current trends without dealing with the problems that we have economically, and unless we are engaging in the world more effectively, then our influence is going to slip.
MODERATOR: Representative Kucinich?
KUCINICH: Yes.
I maybe the only one up here who actually voted against China trade because of the concerns I had that the U.S. was not going to be able to maintain its manufacturing base, which is central to maintaining a middle class.
What we’ve seen is that without solid trade policies, we’re undermined.
Without a strength-through-peace doctrine of rejecting war as an instrument of policy, we’re going to keep borrowing money from China.
Let us not forget we’re borrowing money from China to finance the war in Iraq.
And in addition to that, the speculation on Wall Street has weakened our economy.
We need a policy of constructive engagement with China, stop the arms race with them, work to make sure we have a global climate change treaty with China, get them to transition out of nuclear and coal and oil.
KUCINICH: I’m talking about a whole new direction that’s based on a doctrine of strength through peace.
And I have a voting record up here to back it up, unlike some of my esteemed colleagues.
MODERATOR: Senator Clinton, do we need them more than they need us?
CLINTON: Well, your question about leverage is related to that -- the second question.
We currently still have more leverage, but it doesn’t really count because we’re not using it.
We have handicapped ourselves because of the irresponsible fiscal policies pursued by the Bush economic direction.
But we’ve also, unfortunately, seen an incoherent foreign policy.
So until we set our fiscal house back in order and until we understand that we have to have a strategic relationship with China, it’s going to be very difficult for us to use whatever leverage we have.
And I fear that if we don’t start taking steps to demonstrate that we are back in charge of our fiscal destiny, that we do have a coherent diplomatic approach toward China, China will continue to gain leverage over us.
MODERATOR: It’s the holiday season, and many Americans are heading to the stores.
And many of the products that they’re going to find on the shelves have a Made in China label.
We’ve talked to Iowans about China.
And there’s one listener in particular, his name is Don Frummelt (ph).
He said that consumers and politicians both have a somewhat schizophrenic relationship when it comes to China.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
QUESTION: You can’t have it both ways.
And I think we need candidates who are willing to bite the bullet.
And if you’re going to see our balance of trade is upside down with China, there’s one way to fix it.
Put on some kind of a tariff and prevent the American people from buying $300 TVs instead of $600 TVs.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
MODERATOR: Senator Biden, how would...
BIDEN: Well...
MODERATOR: Would you actually restrict trade with China?
And given the WTO guidelines, could you actually do that?
BIDEN: With the WTO guidelines, we could stop these products coming in now.
This president doesn’t act.
We have much more leverage on China than they have on us.
Let’s get something straight here.
We’re making them into 10 feet tall.
They’ve got 800 million people in poverty.
They’re in real distress.
The idea that a country with 800 million people in poverty has greater leverage over us is preposterous.
What it is, is we’ve yielded to corporate America.
We’ve yielded to this president’s notion of what constitutes trade.
And we’ve refused to enforce the laws that exist.
As president, I would end, flat, bang, no importation of those toys.
Why?
Under WTO, you’re allowed to do it until you send inspectors to guarantee.
BIDEN: Why aren’t they doing it?
Are you willing to go there?
BIDEN: No, I’m not willing to go there.
You don’t need to start a tariff war.
All you have to do is enforce the law, enforce the law.
MODERATOR: Thank you.
Senator Dodd?
DODD: Well, I want to go back to the characterization of the relationship.
Obviously, it’s a strategic one.
But this is not a competition.
If it were a competition, competition implies that people are playing by the same rules.
We’re not playing by the same rules here.
This is an adversarial relationship today.
That needs to change.
But when you manipulate your currency, as they do, in violation of the World Trade Organization here, to the tune of 40 percent, you’ve immediately created a huge disadvantage for our country.
When you employ slave labor in the production of your manufactured goods, when you deny access on your shelves to the products and services we produce, it is not a competition.
It’s adversarial.
Now, I’m not interested in being bellicose about this, but you need to understand exactly what the relationship is today before we decide what steps you take.
We ought to be -- not raising our voice in a loud necessarily way, but we ought to be able to talk about that we need to stand up and say, This is a market you want to be in.
If you want to be here, then you’re going to have to play like an adult here, if you’re going to continue following policies that allow you to manipulate your currency, produce goods that you sell in our marketplace that do damage to our consumers.
He wouldn’t do it.
Had that been a U.S. corporation doing that, their doors would have been shut in 20 minutes.
MODERATOR: Now, my collage Steve has a question.
But first, before we get there, I just want to follow up on something that Mr. Frummelt (ph) said.
He said he wants a president who’s going to level the playing field.
Senator Obama, what would you do in order to give the U.S. more leverage to be able to deal with China at least as an equal partner?
And are you willing to do that despite the consequences, even if it means that consumers have to kiss those $300 television goodbye?
OBAMA: Well, look, I mean, I think Chris and Joe made a good point, which is, we have laws on the books now that aren’t being enforced.
This is what I mean, in terms of us negotiating more effectively with them.
Part of the problem is that the relationship has shifted overtime.
Joe is absolutely right that they were much more impoverished 10, 20 years ago.
And so, our general attitude was, You know what?
What ever they send in, it doesn’t really impact us that much and they’re a poor country.
MODERATOR: But what would you do to level the playing field?
OBAMA: Things have now shifted, so -- well, I’ll just give you an example.
I would say toys cannot come in.
Food, we will have our own safety inspectors on the ground.
Japan does this right now.
They set up their own inspection standards in China and they say, Unless you meet our inspection standards, you cannot ship into here.
If we don’t have labor agreements and environmental agreements that are enforceable, then there are consequences, in terms of them being able to import into this country.
The point is is that we have a set of tools available to us that have not been used.
And part of the reason is because when we talk about Chinese exports, oftentimes, we are talking about U.S. companies...
BIDEN: Exactly right.
OBAMA: ... that have moved to China, are manufacturing there and are trying to ship back and they still have influence.
OBAMA: And those special interests have to be diminished in their voice in Washington.
MODERATOR: Thank you, Senator.
Senator Edwards?
EDWARDS: I want to expand on a point that Joe made, and he mentioned it and it was important, which is, what’s happened is big corporate America is driving American policy with respect to China.
They get their way and the American people lose.
This is only one place that that happens, by the way.
MODERATOR: So what would you do to stand up to U.S. manufacturers?
EDWARDS: There are a bunch of things we need to do.
We have country-of-origin labeling laws.
They’ve been in place for years.
But we don’t enforce them.
MODERATOR: But we also know that China can easily get around that.
They can sometimes use the Made in Hong Kong label instead of the Made in China label.
EDWARDS: But the starting place is to actually enforce the laws that exist here in the United States and their obligations in the WTO, neither of which are being done.
They’re not being done because corporate America drives so much of what happens in Washington, whether it’s trade policy that cost Americans millions of jobs -- NAFTA, CAFTA, et cetera, whether it is the dangerous Chinese toys coming into the United States of America, whether is is country-of-origin labeling -- why is the president of the United States not saying to the American people, to local communities, Buy local ?
It is good for the local economy.
It is good for farmers.
It is good on the issue of global warming, because everything that comes from China carries an enormous carbon footprint with it.
MODERATOR: Steve, indulge me for just a minute.
Your patience for just a minute.
MODERATOR: Sure.
Go right ahead.
MODERATOR: I’m just curious.
You have two small children.
EDWARDS: Yes.
MODERATOR: Will you be buying toys that are made in China to place under the Christmas tree this year?
EDWARDS: No, ma’am, I will not.
(CROSSTALK)
MODERATOR: It’s difficult to do that, because, you know, 70 percent of the goods and most of the toys that you find at the local Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are made in China.
EDWARDS: My kids will not have toys coming from China.
(CROSSTALK)
(LAUGHTER)
DODD: My toys are coming from Iowa.
(LAUGHTER)
DODD: I’m buying Iowa toys.
They’re going to eat Iowa foods.
(LAUGHTER)
(CROSSTALK)
MODERATOR: Senator Obama, and then Senator Gravel.
Senator Obama first on this issue of Chinese toys.
OBAMA: As I said before, the problem is that we are not using the power that we have.
And we just had -- I can’t amplify this point enough.
Right now, laws, with respect to China, are being made in part with the interests of Wall Street in mind and special interests who are manufacturing in China, used to manufacture here in Iowa -- now are manufacturing in China -- are shipping the goods back here and taking advantage of cheap labor and lower environmental standards.
We have to have a president -- and this is part of the reason I’m running for president, is to give a voice to American workers.
I believe in trade.
And I think trade can strengthen America.
And I want, by the way, Chinese workers and consumers to benefit.
That’s good for our long-term security.
But I don’t want every single trade decision to be looked at through the lens of, does this increase corporate profits, as opposed to, is it good for U.S. consumers and U.S. workers?
MODERATOR: Senator Gravel, and then Steve has a question.
GRAVEL: Yes, Michele, I want to take you to task, credit to your first rhetoric.
GRAVEL: Right.
The tremendous increase in the defense.
There are only 10 percent of American defense.
GRAVEL: They haven’t had a tremendous increase -- 10 percent of our defense.
And I want to take all of them to task.
Clearly, none of them are running for China -- president of China, because this amount of demagoguery is shameful.
Here, the Chinese people have a problem.
And when we continue this rhetoric of beggar thy neighbor, where our interests always come first, there should be the interest of human beings, the interest of human beings -- because, when you have a foreign policy that’s
beggar thy neighbor, we all become beggars.
And so when they talk about the currency of China, what about what manipulations we do?
What about the American companies that dump things abroad?
MODERATOR: Senator Gravel, thank you.
GRAVEL: What about the tariffs?
You want to have a...
MODERATOR: Thank you.
GRAVEL: Thank you.
Is any of you willing to state frankly that, if you do what you’re talking about, getting tough on the currency, cracking down on what Senator Dodd called slave labor, taking other steps, that Americans are going to pay more for consumer goods at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and you believe it’s worth it?
Is anyone willing to state frankly that that is the trade-off?
MODERATOR: Congressman Kucinich?
KUCINICH: Either buy America or bye-bye America.
We have to recognize that.
And a Kucinich administration will rebuild American industry.
And while I’m listening to this debate right here, I’m the only one up here who voted against China trade.
My good friend John Edwards who is a friend of mine, you know, he voted for it and is now decrying what’s come over.
I’m saying that it is critical that we rebuild America’s industry, that we not get in an arms race with China, that we have new trade laws, based on workers’ rights, human rights, environmental quality, that we take a new direction with respect to environmental policy, getting China away from nuclear, coal and oil.
I mean, we should be able to have solid relations with China, but we’ve got to get our own house in order, stop the speculation on Wall Street, and stop Wall Street from moving our jobs out of this country.
And that’s what the China trade vote was all about.
MODERATOR: Senator Obama, is that the trade-off: that people will have to pay higher prices if we do what we propose, and that’s worth it in your view?
OBAMA: I actually believe that China will modify its behavior if we actually are tough in our negotiations.
Look, we are the biggest market for China.
They can’t afford to just say, See you later.
They’re going to have to sell here.
If we tell them you have to meet certain safety standards, that you have to enforce certain labor and environmental agreements, they will meet them.
Now, could there potentially be some higher costs on the front end?
Probably, but I guarantee you, I don’t meet a single worker in Iowa who’s been laid-off who says, I wouldn’t rather pay a little bit more for sneakers at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) but still have a job.
MODERATOR: Now listen, just quickly, I want to bring another listen into this, because we did get some questions from the listeners.
And I want to hear from Karen Zuech (ph).
She is a listener.
She is also mother.
So let’s take a quick listen.
QUESTION: As the mom of 1-year-old son, I am very concerned about the toxic chemicals that lace many toys and others products sold in America.
These chemical agents cause cancer, birth defects and genetic damage.
Unlike the European Union, the U.S. does nothing to limit the use of these agents, and does not require that the toxic ingredients are listed.
If you are elected president, what changes will you make to ensure that my son will grow up free from these frightening dangers?
MODERATOR: Karen Zuech (ph) there.
She’s pointing out that the European Union has stricter standards.
But if you look at the Chinese recalls in this country, they still represent fewer than one one-hundredth of all of the toys and products that come into this country.
Is it possible that the U.S. could overreact to this?
I’m posing this to Senator Clinton.
What’s the danger of that?
CLINTON: Well, first, I really sympathize with the young mother, because we don’t do anywhere near enough to try to prevent dangerous materials and products from coming into our country.
We don’t even do enough of it within our own country.
We have totally turned our back on the information that is available to try to better track the impact on children and others of these kinds of exposures to toxic materials.
So, number one, we need tougher standards across the board; something I’ve been advocating for for years.
Number two, it should be especially applied to any kind of imports, and the requires going and making sure that we have inspectors on the ground and we have tough standards and we exercise recalls.
You know, the reason we have such few recalls, even though they have been increasing, because the evidence has been so overwhelming, is because this administration has basically de-fanged the Consumer Product Safety Commission, they do not have any real appetite for going after these companies and countries that are flooding our markets with dangerous products, and that has to stop.
MODERATOR: We only have just a few -- a very short time, Senator Dodd, but I just want to ask you, because you’ve served in the Senate for some time, given the concerns about currency manipulation, product recalls, is there any vote that you would look back at and think, You know, I really wish I could reconsider that ?
DODD: No, no.
I wish the Senate would have reconsidered when I offered legislation on lead paint, for instance, here to try and reduce the kind of problems that Karen has talked about.
I have a child that has serious food allergies here.
Eighty percent of the food we consume in this country’s imported and only 1 percent of it is inspected.
And there’s no country of labeling on those products here.
And you’ll have 10 different descriptions of an egg here, and that’s very difficult, if not impossible, for women like Karen.
And parents who have children have to be careful about the products they consume.
MODERATOR: OK. We’re going to have to leave this part of our discussion right there.
We’ll take a break for just a few minutes, then we will continue with the second hour of our Democratic presidential debate from Des Moines.
This is special coverage from NPR News.
And this is how one listener, Pen Pen Wong (ph), of Venice, California, put it.
Let’s listen.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
QUESTION: Many presidential candidates have talked tough about China and its human rights record in the past but, in the end, favor secure our economic interests, rather than risk upsetting China by substantively talking about the human rights issue.
China is given a free pass to go at her own pace.
How would you balance human rights and trade with China?
(END AUDIO CLIP)
MODERATOR: Senator Biden, I’d like to begin with you.
What kind of human rights commitment should the U.S. try to exact from China, particularly in advance of the 2008 Olympics, and how do you ensure that the country would actually live up to those commitments?
BIDEN: You can’t ensure it.
But, look, this is all about playing by the rules.
I have been pushing, as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, for the last seven years -- or of the ranking member during that period -- that we hold China accountable at the United Nations.
We’re talking about competition.
That’s the -- in terms of trade.
It’s capitulation, not competition.
Name me another country in the world that we would allow to conduct themselves the way this country has, China, and not call them to -- on the carpet at the U.N.
Name me another country in the world who would use the trade practices they use with us that we would not call them on the carpet.

MODERATOR: So, Senator Biden, are you saying that would call them on the carpet, that you would...
BIDEN: Absolutely.
MODERATOR: ... appoint a U.N. ambassador who would press for this?
BIDEN: And the reason I would is that it’s the one way to get China to reform.
You can’t close your eyes.
You can’t pretend.
It is self-defeating.
It’s a Hobson’s choice we’re giving people here.
MODERATOR: A Hobson’s choice is how Senator Biden characterized this.
Senator Clinton, what kind of commitment should we try to exact from China?
CLINTON: Well, I agree with Joe very much.
You know, 12 years ago, I went to China and the Chinese didn’t want me to come.
And they didn’t want me to make a speech.
And I think you do have to call them on it.
I mean, the Chinese respect us if we actually call them on their misbehavior and their breaches of human rights, economic activities and other kinds of problems that we have with them.
That’s what I object to about this administration.
We’ve gotten the worst of both worlds.
We’ve gotten neither the kind of smart enforcement nor the kind of cooperation that might lead to changes in behavior.
Instead, we have this erratic, incoherent policy.
So I think it’s important that as the next president I would make it very clear what we expect from China and use every tool at our disposal to try to change behavior.
And, conversely, if you were elected president, would he advise you?
So I was deeply involved in being part of the Clinton team, in the first Clinton administration.
And I am someone who wants the best possible advice from as many different sources as possible.
And that would certainly include my husband.
MODERATOR: Senator Dodd?
DODD: Well, I think there’s an ongoing situation.
We raised the issue, not often enough, on Tibet and what’s happened with the almost-genocidal behavior, when dealing with this remarkable culture that’s been under assault.
And the idea that we’d recognize him and welcome him here as a religious leader in the world is exactly the kind of symbol we need to send.
We’re talking here about a lot of things we would do to be tougher in China.
It’s also important to understand a balance is necessary here.
China is acquiring massive natural resources, that you raised earlier, around the world.
They have huge energy issues.
Twenty-five million people a year move from rural China to urban China.
We ought to be working with them in various areas on energy policy, environmental policy as well.
So I don’t want this to be seen, as we discuss this today here, only just about the acrimonious or the difficult or the tough positions we’re going to take, but to make them recognize that the Dalai Lama is an international religious leader who’s worthy of recognition.
And if they, as they apparently did, threaten to deny some ships to be able to move in waters off China over that, they need to understand this isn’t going to change in a Democratic administration.
MODERATOR: Senator Edwards, with all this tough talk about China, how do you actually hold them accountable?
EDWARDS: You hold them accountable in the WTO.
America uses its diplomacy and economic leverage.
We have enormous leverage with the Chinese.
And I want to add on to one thing that Chris just said.
This whole issue of balance, if you look at what’s happened -- and this didn’t just happen under George Bush; this has been going on for a decade and a half now -- in my home town, the mill that my father worked in, the people that I grew up with, that mill’s closed now.
The jobs are gone.
The same thing has happened in Newton, Iowa, and all across this state.
American trade policy is catering to the interests of big corporate America.
It has been for a decade and a half.
And we desperately need a president of the United States who instead of asking is this going to help corporate profits, is this actually going to stand up for American workers and American jobs?
MODERATOR: Robert has a question, but just quickly, I just heard you say that America has enormous leverage.
EDWARDS: Oh, no, I didn’t.
No, I said we have more leverage than they do.
We do.
I think everybody actually agrees with that.
But our leverage is economic, our leverage is diplomatic.
And we have leverage within the WTO, which Senator Biden and others have spoken about.
But we have not held China accountable.
And the result is the loss of American jobs, the struggling of American families, the struggles of the middle class.
And as we’ve already talked about, dangerous Chinese products coming into the United States.
MODERATOR: So diminished, but significant.
The textile -- that the United States become once again a major power in textile production, and industry we associate with low-wage emerging economies.
Isn’t it fair to think that, no matter what our relationship with China, obviously poorer countries are going to be producing a lot of textiles in mills around the world; it’s just not what our economy should be specializing in at this time?
EDWARDS: What is fair to think is that we have had a trade policy that has cost America.
My father, who worked in a mill for 37 years so that I could be -- and my brother and sister could have a better life than he had.
And that mill that he worked in is gone.
Jobs all across Iowa are gone.
And the reason is because America has catered to the interest of corporate profits; not the interests of the American middle class, not the interests of American workers, and not the interests of these manufacturing jobs.
Are there other things we need to do?
Of course there are.
America, to be competitive over the long-term, needs a trade policy that works that looks out for the interest of the middle class.
But it also needs -- America needs -- to be the most creative, best educated, most innovative work force on the planet.
Those two things are not mutually exclusive.
They can both be done at the same time.
MODERATOR: Thank you, very much.
Senator Obama, I just want to return to the question of currency manipulation.
You had said that if China is actually manipulating their currency, this country needs to take them to the mat.
OBAMA: Well, we have legislation that says that if, in fact, they are manipulating their currency -- and I think there’s no dispute that they are -- that we need to take strong action.
It’s in the Banking Committee.
Chris is presiding over that.
And now here’s the problem.
I will say that it’s actually a blunt tool.
I’d prefer not doing this legislatively.
The problem is we’ve had a president that has shown no leadership on it.
So, if and when I am in the White House, I will meet directly with the Chinese leadership and indicate we have to restore balance.
And, by the way, we have to mobilize our allies, such as the European Union, to have that conversation with us.
This is an imbalance that is not good for any economy over time.
It’s not sustainable, the trade imbalances that we have.
But just to go to a point that was made earlier, so often we see these issues as contradictory.
Mike Gravel, I am interested, as I said, in making sure that the Chinese population is fed and clothed and advancing.
I think that is important.
It is not, I think, in the long-term interests of China to expand, solely on the backs of low-wage work that is undermining U.S. work.
If we are saying to China, Raise your labor standards, that will, over time, improve the lot of Chinese workers, as well as U.S. workers.
And that’s what we should be looking at, is: How can we improve the working conditions, the safety conditions, the consumer protections that are available for all people?
And that’s not what’s happening right now.
MODERATOR: Senator Obama, thank you.
Senator Biden, very quickly.
BIDEN: Look, first of all, I don’t buy this being -- why you’re being so tough on China.
Would we do any of these things with regard to France or Germany or England, our friends, our allies?
The answer is: We would.
MODERATOR: Do you think it’s an analogous situation?
BIDEN: No, I think it is not.
Look, if France was acting like China is acting, we’d be tough with them.
If England was doing what China is doing we’d be tough with them.
This is about being fair.
Us doing it by ourselves is the ultimate blunt instrument.
We may be able to do that.
But were I president, I’d be calling a similar conference, bringing in the rest of the world to rationalize our currencies here.
MODERATOR: I just want to turn to something that Senator Clinton said.
You said that China reacts if they are pressed.
So would we believe that -- should we believe that the relationship, the U.S. relationship with China, under a Hillary Clinton administration, would be less one of cooperation and engagement and one more akin to confrontation?
CLINTON: No.
No, absolutely not.
It would be a position where we would operate from strength, with a coherent policy about what our interests were and what we hoped to achieve.
I’ll give you a quick example.
I have a company in my state that has exported into China for many years.
All of a sudden, out of the blue, they were told that they were going to start having tariffs slapped on their product that would have made it absolutely uncompetitive for them to compete.
MODERATOR: Thank you.
That’s where we’re going to have to end our discussion of China.
We could have gone on, but thanks to all the candidates.
We’ll continue in just a minute with our Democratic presidential debate.
The so-called M word is our next topic.
MODERATOR: Candidates, we have just been doing some reporting in the last few days from Marshalltown, Iowa, a city that I know many of you have visited.
This is a city with a lot of immigrants, a number of illegal immigrants.
There have been immigration raids there.
And that raises questions about citizens in places like that all over America.
Some citizens in Marshalltown turn in illegal immigrants; some take them in.
There’s actually a person who’s been indicted for sheltering immigrants, which raises a question that I’d like to put to you.
What obligations do American citizens have when it comes to illegal immigrants?
And let’s start with Senator Obama.
Would you expect Americans, if you’re president, January 2009, immigration reform, whatever you want hasn’t happened yet, would you expect Americans to turn in illegal immigrants when they come across?
OBAMA: We do not deputize the American people to do the job that the federal government is supposed to do.
So as president of the United States, I will make sure that the federal government does what it’s supposed to do, which is to do a better job of closing our borders and preventing hundreds of thousands of people to pour in, have much tougher enforcement standards when it comes to employers, and create a pathway of citizenship for the 12 million people who are already here.
MODERATOR: So does that mean that Americans should not turn in illegal immigrants?
OBAMA: The point is that we are not going to have -- we’re not going to deputize a whole bunch of American citizens to start grabbing people or turning them in, in part because the ordinary American citizen may not know whether or not this person is illegal or not.
Now, we should be holding employers accountable, because they have a mechanism whereby they can actually enforce.
But, you know, the notion that we’re going to criminalize priests, for example, or doctors who are providing services to individuals, and throw them in jail for doing what their calling asks them to do, which is to provide help and service to people in need, I think that is a mistake.
I think that’s out of America’s character.
MODERATOR: I’m going to get to several candidates on this.
Senator Dodd, let’s say that you’re hiring a nanny.
Perhaps you’ve had this experience.
DODD: No, I haven’t, actually.
MODERATOR: Well, let’s say that you have...
DODD: Nice try.
(LAUGHTER)
MODERATOR: ... for your kids.
Let’s say that a citizen is hiring a nanny.
DODD: Check it out, very thoroughly.
Yes.
MODERATOR: A working parent.
You interview of applicants.
They all seem very nice.
They seem like they would take care of the kids.
But it would appear that their documents may not be in order.
What would you want an American to do?
DODD: Well, I think you’ve got an obligation here to go beyond that if you have any doubts or questions here.
People who knowingly hire undocumented workers I think need to be held accountable to a far higher degree of penalties -- civil and possibly criminal, if, in fact, it’s widespread -- because these are the things that are going to slow down -- the 400,000 to 500,000 people who come here each year.
You know, I understand -- look, I think this debate has to begin some place.
I’m very worried about the fear and hate-mongers out there who are going to divide this country very terribly on this subject matter.
We’ve been a welcoming people for the entire history of our nation here.
But, obviously, any self-respecting country has to control its borders and has to impose penalties that would otherwise attract people to come here; understanding why they want to be here, but also understanding our capacity and ability to handle this.
That’s why I’ve taken the strong position here of doing whatever we can on both sides of the border, and I’ve worked at this for a long time.
For 20 years, I’ve chaired the inter-parliamentary with Mexico.
I speak the language fluently.
We have a large percentage of people coming from Latin America.
You want to go right to the heart of these things here.
Exactly what happens is businesses locate there and race to the bottom.
Instead of improving the quality of working conditions that would give people in these countries a chance to stay in their own nations, which most of them would prefer to do, we’re encouraging people to come here by not having trading agreements that don’t insist upon...
MODERATOR: We’re going to talk more about those issues as we go along here.
But, sticking with real people, Congressman Kucinich, the real person in that situation, what should they do?
KUCINICH: Rely on the Constitution.
You know, we don’t -- we don’t encourage vigilantism in this country.
We have a Constitution.
We have due process.
We have equal protection.
We have habeas corpus.
This administration would like to shred the Constitution and deny people all those rights.
But when we get into that, what we do, we take the path of denying constitutional rights, and we’re back to Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and all those other violations of rights that we’re ashamed of now.
And I’m saying that we have to realize that these are economic refugees from NAFTA.
You know, I’ve said it over and over -- cancel NAFTA, negotiate a new trade agreement with Mexico based on worker’s rights, human rights, environmental quality principles.
Give a path to legalization for the people who have been here.
You can’t send them home willy-nilly.
You have to have a way in which our immigration policy resonates with the deeper principles of inclusiveness in America, as symbolized by our Statute of Liberty.
MODERATOR: We may get to NAFTA as well, time permitting.
I want to play a bit of tape, though, of Amy Vybiral.
She’s at the Marshalltown Education and Training Center, so she’s somebody who deals with this in real time.
And here’s the policy that she follows as an English as a second language institution, teaching immigrants.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
QUESTION: I don’t know their status.
And I don’t -- we don’t ask.
Let me put it this way, we ask a Social Security number of everybody who enters.
And we require it of no one.
So it’s not a prerequisite to attend the college.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
MODERATOR: Senator Clinton, if you’re president in January of 2009, is don’t ask/don’t tell, which is a way you could characterize her policy there -- is that appropriate for people in institutions that receive government funding?
CLINTON: Well, I agree with what Barack and Chris and Dennis have already said.
It’s the failure of the federal government that puts people like Amy into this position.
I do not think we should be criminalizing her or expecting her to enforce the broken laws of our federal immigration system.
That is not in keeping with who we are as Americans.
What is in keeping is having a government fulfill its responsibilities.
That would be my highest priority, and that’s what I would attempt to achieve with comprehensive immigration reform.
QUESTION: Although, if a citizen witnessed some other kind of crime, wouldn’t you want them to report it?
CLINTON: Well, you know, it’s a very clever question, but I think it really begs the question.
Because what we’re looking at here is 12 million to 14 million people.
They live in our neighborhoods.
They take care of our elderly parents.
They are embedded in our society.
If we want to listen to the demagogues and the calls for us to begin to try to round up people and turn every American into a suspicious vigilante, I think we will do graver harm to the fabric of our nation than any kind of person-by- person reporting of someone who might be here illegally.
I reject that.
I think again, you have to look at the failure of the federal government and the failure of our political system to make a change in how we should be enforcing our immigration laws, and that’s what I will try to do.
MODERATOR: Senator Biden?
BIDEN: I’d like to make a distinction here.
And I agree with Hillary on this.
What Amy, as I understood the question, is doing is providing a service there to children.
There’s 1.8 million children here.
MODERATOR (?
): Many adults as well.
People learning English as a second language...
BIDEN: Well, I just assumed she was talking about children.
There’s a distinction, quite frankly, between providing a service and providing for you being able to make money by hiring someone you can hire cheaply in order to be able to make your business grow.
I find a moral distinction there, number one.
Number two, as a single parent for five years, after my wife and daughter were killed, raising two kids -- I went through, out of necessity, trying to figure out how to get a nanny to help me out.
Guess what?
The majority of the people here undocumented, 60 percent, are not Spanish speaking.
They’ve overstayed their visas.
MODERATOR: You used the same figure at the Brown and Black Forum on Saturday, but the Pew Research Center has estimated this, that in fact 56 percent of the illegal immigrants are from Mexico and 22 percent from other Latin American countries.
DODD: They are.
BIDEN: Well, Chris tells me they are.
The data I received was that the total amount of people who are here undocumented, and the people overstaying their visas, were people who are not from Latin America.
Chris knows more about this than...
DODD: I think both of you are right.
The Pew statistics I think more recent arrivals, and that number is higher coming from Latin America.
Overall, Joe’s point, the people going back years here, would include a larger number coming from non-Latin American countries.
So both numbers may be accurate.
Just depends how you frame it.
BIDEN: But the point is, the idea here is that it seems to me there’s an obligation on the part of an employer who is seeking someone to work for him or her to know whether or not that opportunity is being given first to an American, before they hire someone here who is legal or illegal -- I mean, excuse me, who is illegal.
I mean...
MODERATOR: Just a yes or no question before we go on, Senator.
Those Irish people and others, illegal immigrants, you interviewed.
Did you hire one?
BIDEN: Did not hire one.
Absolutely not.
BIDEN: I found -- I didn’t find anyone.
I thank God for my sister.
And by the way, you may remember, I’m the guy that reminded the former administration that Zoe Baird was a little bit of a problem, if you may remember.
MODERATOR: Let me move on to Senator Edwards, if I might.
Senator Edwards, in a recent debate, you said, as I’m sure you’ve said many times, that illegal workers are exploited, that they’re paid less, if they try to report problems, they’re asked about their immigration status.
But you have also said that you do not believe that illegal immigration is driving down wages.
If they’re being paid less, how can they not be driving down wages?
EDWARDS: What I’ve actually said is there have been some serious academic studies done on this question.
And the studies are not the same.
They have not reached the same conclusions.
I think that there is -- there is some confusion in the work that’s been done -- the research that’s been done on this question.
But what I’ve also described are some of the things that I’ve seen firsthand.
The town -- the small town that I grew up in in North Carolina is now about half Latino, Hispanic.
And what I consistently heard from the workers -- I’ve heard this all over the place -- is they’re not being paid in many cases for the work that they’ve done; not being paid overtime; not being paid, in many cases, the minimum wage.
And if they raise any question about it, the first question the employer asks is, What is your status?
MODERATOR: Well, how are they not driving down wages for everybody else if that’s the case?
EDWARDS: Well, I think what the studies show is there are a lot of things driving down wages in the United States of America.
One of those things, which I hope we have time to talk more about is the loss of good middle-class jobs, which has been accelerated under this administration but didn’t begin under this administration.
And I think there are a variety of things that are contributing to that.
And the great issue facing the next president -- and it will be facing me as president -- is: What do we do to strengthen and grow the middle class?
And there are a whole range of things that we need to do, if we actually want to save the middle class and strengthen the American economy.
MODERATOR: I just want to follow up, Senator Edwards, on something that you said.
I’ve had the pleasure at a debate setting in front of you twice within the last week.
And, at the debate on Saturday, you noted that undocumented immigrants are punished if they complain about unsafe conditions, if they speak up.
And you noted that these workers would have rights, they would be looked after in an Edwards administration.
What rights do immigrants have if they’re working without proper authorization?
EDWARDS: Well, the answer to this is not a short-term solution.
I wish there were a clear short-term solution that would be effective.
The answer to this is comprehensive immigration reform.
That is ultimately the answer.
MODERATOR: But until you get to that point, if workers don’t have proper identification, proper authorization, what rights would they have under your administration.
EDWARDS: They’re in a very vulnerable position.
And what we want to make certain, and that we would do in my administration, is that we are enforcing the laws that apply to employers.
People in this discussions have talked about enforcing the responsibilities of employers not to hire undocumented workers.
That’s true, and that is a responsibility, and I would do that as president until we had comprehensive immigration reform.
But we can’t continue to allow -- in my state we have agricultural workers who are being taken advantage of and abused, and in many cases living in horrid, horrid conditions.
MODERATOR: Senator, I’m just going to try this one more time.
How would you, quote, take care of them?
EDWARDS: Well...
MODERATOR: What rights would they have?
EDWARDS: What we would do is we’d use the power of the federal government and the power of our regulatory agencies to ensure that these people are not being abused.
Like the -- I’ll give a specific example: the poultry workers that I met in Canton, Mississippi.
We would make certain that their work conditions were safe.
We’d make certain that they’re in fact being paid for the work that they’re doing; if they’re working overtime, that they’re being paid for their overtime.
Those are all things that we would do in my administration.
MODERATOR: Senator Obama, then Congressman Kucinich?
OBAMA: Well, look, this requires leadership.
I believe that there are circumstances where, in fact, illegal immigrants are driving down wages.
The question is: How do we fix it?
Because, oftentimes, when it’s posed that way, then the thinking is that somehow we have to pit low-wage American workers versus low-wage immigrant workers.
My answer is to stop illegal workers from coming in, hold employers accountable, but give the 12 million people who are here illegally, many of whom have been here for years, many of whom have U.S. citizens for children, to make sure that they’ve got a pathway to legalization.
If we do that, then they do have right that they can access.
MODERATOR: What about January 2009 -- still millions of illegals -- would you let them work?
Would you encourage them to work?
Would you give them rights as they work?
OBAMA: No, no, no, no.
I think that, if they’re illegal, then they should not be able to work in this country.
That is part of the principle of comprehensive reform -- that we’re going to crack down on employers who are hiring them and taking advantage of them.
But I also want to give them a pathway so that they can earn citizenship, earn a legal status, start learning English, pay a significant fine, go to the back of the line, but they can then stay here and they can have the ability to enforce a minimum wage that they’re paid, make sure the worker safety laws are available, make sure that they can join a union.
MODERATOR: Congressman Kucinich, would you let people work in January 2009 if you’re president?
KUCINICH: Absolutely.
I mean, you know, we have to recognize that many of them have continued to work in providing services.
We have to get them a path to legalization.
But you raised the question -- the question is: Are they driving wages down?
Wall Street speculation, ending in closing plants, have driven wages down.
Non-productive military spending drives wages down.
What your panel here is conjuring is taking -- is the same approach that the Bush administration has sued in denying any kind of rights at all to so-called enemy non-combatants.
And I say that a Kucinich administration, everyone who’s in this country or within the reach of this country, has to be accorded constitutional rights that would be accorded to anyone else, because that’s what we stand on.
This is one of the reasons why I am pursuing impeachment against the vice president, because he’s trashed the Constitution.
MODERATOR: Former Senator Gravel?
GRAVEL: This has become obvious in this discussion; that there has to be a reason why, over the last 15 years we haven’t solved this problem as a nation.
Stop and think.
Our unemployment level is about 4.5, and that’s about as low as you can get it.
So where is the problem?
We have to have people fill these jobs.
They come in and fill these jobs.
We call them illegal.
Are they illegal?
They’re filling jobs that need to be done.
If we were to chase them out, aren’t we playing to the nativist, the crazies who are opposed to anybody coming in since they got here?
And the media plays into this.
The Congress plays into this.
Just open our doors.
When the jobs are there to be filled, they’ll come in.
The jobs aren’t there, they’ll go home.
We can deal with all these other problems in trade, but we’re making a mountain out of a mole hill.
We’re creating laws.
We’re trying to deal with this.
Deal with the obvious.
We do not seem, as a nation, to be able to solve this problem the way we’ve been approaching it.
MODERATOR: Senator Mike Gravel, Former Senator Mike Gravel, thanks very much.
A couple of other candidates had their hands up, but we are approaching a break here so let me assure you that we will continue a bit more on this topic after the break.
You are listening to the NPR Democratic candidates’ debate from Des Moines.
We’re going to take a break of about a minute.
This is special coverage from NPR News.
And I do want to ask about a very similar topic, Senator.
You said in a debate on Saturday night that you support people who are, as you put it, Yes, undocumented, but also working hard, trying to support their families.
That’s why they’re here.
In the same answer, you said you want to crack down on employers.
Is there a contradiction there?
If you crack down on employers, doesn’t that mean you’re telling employers to put these hard-working people, as you define them, out of work?
CLINTON: No, there is no contradiction.
You know, comprehensive immigration reform means five things.
You have to have tough border security plus a system of knowing who’s here and what they’re doing.
Secondly, you’ve got to crack down on employers, because people wouldn’t come if there weren’t a job waiting for them.
Third, you’ve got to provide more help to local communities to be able to bear the cost, because they don’t set immigration policy.
Fourth, you do have to do what Chris Dodd is talking about, and that is, try to create some economic activity by working with the countries to our south.
But, fifth, you’ve got to have a path toward legalization.
And I’m in favor of all of that.
MODERATOR: But granted that...
CLINTON: And I just want to...
MODERATOR: But granting that it may take a while to do that...
CLINTON: Well, yes, it will.
But let’s put this in context, because, you know, sometimes we talk about these issues as though they’re stove piped.
Part of the reason we’re having this contentious, demagogic debate right now about immigration is because the economy is not performing for average Americans.
Yes, the reported unemployment rate is 4.7 percent.
But the labor force participation rate has fallen dramatically.
That means people have given up looking for work.
There is no effort to try to ease the transitions that do happen in any economy.
You know, I traveled this country extensively during the 1990s.
Why?
People’s incomes were rising.
Now, Americans feel like they’re standing on a trapdoor.
MODERATOR: Granting that you want to do several things, it appears from the reality of the moment that the easy thing to do is to crack down.
Everything else is hard and may take a while.
January 2009, as I’ve asked other candidates, are you going to crack down on employers, given that that may harm people you’ve defined as hard-working?
CLINTON: I will crack down on employers.
I will do all five things that I just outlined.
But I think it’s important to look at where this debate is often taken to such an extreme, because you’ll hear the voices of those saying, Deport people.
Round them up.
That is absolutely unrealistic, and it is not in keeping with American values.
The best estimates I have is it would take about $200 billion over five years to round up 12 to 14 million people.
It would takes tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of new law enforcement officials.
It would take a convoy of 200,000 buses stretching 1,700 miles.
People in America would be outraged at the loss of their privacy and the invasion of their homes and businesses.
So we’ve got to do all five of the things, and I would start immediately to do that.
MODERATOR: Senators Obama and Dodd, can you limit yourselves to 30 seconds each?
Senator Obama?
OBAMA: You’ve asked a couple of times, Are you going to crack down on January 1st, 2009?
Listen, I will initiate the process immediately.
But to get comprehensive reform, to get an employer-verification system that works is going to take some time, just the same way that a pathway to legalization is going to take some time.
But what it takes is some leadership.
Look, two years ago, I worked with about 10 other senators -- McCain, Kennedy, Graham -- an unlikely group -- Brownback -- and we put together a package that had everything that Senator Clinton and others have talked about.
But what you have not see over the last several years is leadership from the president to change the tone and to describe to the American people how we can be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.
MODERATOR: Senator Dodd?
DODD: Just a couple of points.
And that point that Barack just made is very important.
This is a failure of leadership by this administration to step in at critical moments when we could have gotten something done.
We need to also recognize there are people at this very hour that are showing up at U.S. embassies all over the world who are seeking to come here through legal means, and we need to keep them in mind.
If it looks as though they’re fools to be doing what they’re doing, because we’re creating virtually an amnesty program in this country, then you’re going to have an awful problem around the world.
So we need to understand that.
And, thirdly, this point.
Look, let’s understand this.
The Republicans, the extreme conservatives here, want this issue on the table.
They don’t want to talk about the war in Iraq.
They don’t want to talk about the failure of fiscal policies here at home.
They don’t want to talk about what’s going on with health care in the country.
So they’re going to use this issue as a wedge issue here to inflame the passions, the fears and hatreds of too many Americans.
We’ve see it in the past in our country.
It’s dangerous politics.
And we need to describe it for what it is.
MODERATOR: I’m sorry that we’re limited on time.
We need to move on.
MODERATOR: A question for Senator Edwards.
If you’re elected president you’ll hear competing claims about H1B visas for highly skilled workers.
People like Bill Gates will tell you we should have much, much more of them to bring in more highly skilled workers.
Critics of that will say: No, the United States is training other countries’ engineers, and in fact those workers are working for less than American-trained specialists and engineers would.
What would you do as president, expand H1B visas or scale them back?
EDWARDS: Well, the first point is: Why is America not educating and training American workers to do these jobs?
I mean, that’s the starting point.
MODERATOR: Well, there are Americans who say that they are being trained for those jobs, but that they can’t compete with workers from India, who will work for 10 percent less.
If American workers are actually competent to do those jobs, American workers should be doing those jobs.
The whole purpose of the H1B visa program is to bring people from other places who have to do jobs that we don’t have American workers to do.
Now, I think there are two pieces to this.
One is, if there are American workers who can do the jobs, they should be doing them, as I just said.
And they will, when I’m president.
Second, if we don’t have adequate American workers -- and this is the other side of the equation, what Bill Gates and others would argue, and I’ve heard the same arguments -- then that means America’s not doing its job of educating our young people.
MODERATOR: But are you saying that, for you it’s a matter of fact-finding, to see which way you would go on H1B visas, or have you already made up your mind that they should be limited or they should be increased?
EDWARDS: I believe that there are American workers who can do some of these jobs that people are being brought from other places to do.
And I think those American workers, if they’re there and available, should be doing the jobs.
But you’ve got to give my 30 more seconds on this.
Because you can’ ignore the underlying issue.
The underlying issue is, are we making it easier for kids to go to college?
Are we driving our young people into engineering, science, and math, the very areas that we’re talking about?
And are we doing it in a way that will strengthen the American economy over the long-term?
Because if we don’t -- if we are not the most creative, best educated, most innovative workforce on the planet, it is very difficult for us to compete.
MODERATOR: Senator Biden?
BIDEN: Look, I’ve been working with this for a long time, as former chairman of the Judiciary Committee -- that’s where it comes out of.
We have it about right now, except that the employers aren’t doing their part.
You used the example of an Indian engineer who’d work less than an American engineer.
The truth is they’re not allowed to hire based on that.
If there’s American there that will take the job, they can’t undercut it by hiring an Indian engineer who will work for less.
That’s illegal.
We’re not enforcing it.
The second point I’d make is, you know, we make this all out to be so black and white.
I’m the author of the Violence Against Women Act.
It came to my attention not long -- it’s relevant, believe it or not.
Immigrant women getting the living crap beat out of them; getting brutalized -- brutalized.
And they’re afraid to come forward and acknowledge they’re being brutalized because they’ll be deported.
So what we have to do, sometimes humanitarian needs trump -- trump immigration laws.
It’s now the law that a woman who comes forward of being beaten will be effectively immune from being deported so you can put the SOB who’s beating her in jail.
So sometimes it trumps.
Sometimes humanitarian needs trump an existing law relating to immigration like that.
MODERATOR: Let me move on to another subject here because our time is quite short.
DODD: Health care would be a good example of that as well.
(CROSSTALK)
(LAUGHTER)
MODERATOR: Let me move on.
We’re running shy of time here.

The agreement would allow distressed borrowers who are current on their payments to keep their low introductory rates and escape an increase of 30 percent or more in their monthly payments when those rates expire.
“The housing market is moving through a period of change,” Mr. Bush said.
“In recent years, innovative mortgage products have helped millions of Americans afford their own homes, and that’s good.

The agreement contains numerous limitations that would exclude many — if not most — subprime borrowers.
It would apply to loans taken out between Jan. 1, 2005, and July 30, 2007, and scheduled to rise in 2008 and 2009.
It would exclude those who are delinquent on their payments — about 22 percent of all subprime borrowers, according to First American LoanPerformance, an industry research firm.

Among those sure to be disappointed are borrowers whose introductory rates expire before Jan. 1.
About $57 billion in subprime loans were scheduled to be reset at higher rates in the final three months of this year, according to estimates by First American LoanPerformance.
Mortgage companies could also exclude borrowers who they conclude are making enough money to afford higher monthly payments.
Barclays Capital — extrapolating from a similar program recently unveiled in California — estimates that only about 12 percent of all subprime borrowers, or 240,000 homeowners, would get relief.
The plan is emerging as fallout from the mortgage crisis is seeping into the political sphere.
But with the meltdown growing worse, housing prices still plunging and many economists worrying about a recession, President Bush and his Democratic opponents are now racing to come up with answers.

Mr. Bush said the Justice Department “will continue to pursue wrongdoing in the banking and housing industries, so we can help ensure that those who defraud American consumers face justice.” He also prodded Congress to enact legislation to make more loan assistance available through the Federal Housing Administration.

Democratic presidential candidates have complained that the White House plan was overly narrow.
“It seems that President Bush is going to give struggling homeowners far less than they need,” Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York said in a statement on Monday.
“With news accounts using terms like ‘whittled down’ and ‘limited’ to describe the scope of the Bush plan, it appears that the president is pushing a freeze for a very narrow group of borrowers.”
Mrs. Clinton visited the Nasdaq stock market in New York on Wednesday and assailed Wall Street firms for the mortgage mess.
She called for a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures and a rate freeze that would apply to all borrowers current on payments and some who have fallen behind.

Despite the criticism, the Bush plan is a significant change in an initial reluctance to impose solutions.
As recently as a month ago, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. argued that lenders should try to work out new terms on a case-by-case basis.
But Mr. Paulson and federal banking regulators became increasingly impatient with the industry’s failure to produce a systematic, rapid approach to evaluating borrowers.

Sheila C. Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, proposed a comparatively radical plan to permanently freeze rates on all subprime loans.
Mr. Bush will also ask Congress to temporarily expand the authority of states and localities to issue tax-exempt mortgage-revenue bonds to help people refinance their mortgages.

Treasury officials are also pushing the industry to come up with a streamlined way to help subprime borrowers refinance with a more conventional, lower-rate mortgage.

Subprime loans typically come with high interest rates, and were originally intended for people with poor credit histories.
But some analysts say that more than a third of all subprime borrowers could have qualified for cheaper conventional loans at the outset.
Republican presidential candidates have seemed reluctant to propose government rescue plans, seeing them as a bailout.
But they are feeling the heat nonetheless, and some are joining Mr. Paulson’s effort to help people in danger of losing their homes.

John Edwards, the Democratic presidential candidate and former senator from North Carolina, on Wednesday proposed a seven-year freeze in subprime interest rates, as well as a new fund to help distressed borrowers.
Mr. Edwards also called for a change in bankruptcy laws that would give homeowners far more bargaining power in negotiating new terms.
Senator Barack Obama of Illinois jumped ahead of many of his Democratic presidential rivals in September with detailed recommendations that included a government rescue fund, changes in bankruptcy law and a new tax credit on mortgage interest for people who do not itemize their taxes and cannot currently deduct their interest payments.

Adding to the political pressure, many of the states that are hardest hit by mortgage defaults and falling home prices are important election swing states.
They include Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
The first two voting states, Iowa and New Hampshire, have not been particularly hard hit by the housing crisis, but two of the states with early nominating contests — Florida and Nevada — have among the worst problems in the country.
“Even though foreign policy has been dominating the election for the past year, economics will pay a bigger role next year,” said Howard Glaser, a mortgage industry consultant who worked in the Clinton administration and is an adviser to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.
“Not only will the specific mortgage and housing problems intensify, the ripple effects on the economy will also magnify.”
On Wall Street, markets barely moved yesterday, absorbing the jobs data with ambivalence.
The employment picture offered assurance that the economy was not plummeting and might continue to expand, sustaining corporate profits.

A number of market participants have urged a half-point cut in the Fed’s key throttle control over the banking system, currently at 4.5 percent, but a stronger job market may make a quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate more likely.
Central bankers have signaled that they intend to try to avert a recession with looser credit, but remain wary of fueling inflation with an unnecessarily sharp cut in rates — particularly in a period of high oil costs and rising food prices.
“Financial markets can kiss goodbye any chance of a half-point cut,” said Ellen Zentner, United States macroeconomist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.
“The kind of average jobs growth we’ve been getting, in the neighborhood of 100,000 per month, is like butter to the Fed, which looks to keep job creation going, but not so much so that wage inflation becomes a concern.”

Average hourly wages among rank-and-file workers — about four-fifths of the work force — rose 8 cents, to $17.63 last month, according to the jobs report.
But the November wage came against a more pronounced backdrop pointing to a longer-term erosion of spending power for most American workers.

While many Americans at the top of the income ladder have done well, wage gains in the current economic expansion have been generally weak.
The inflation-adjusted hourly wage for rank-and-file workers has risen by just a penny over the last four years, from $17.62 in November 2003.
Over the last year, they have actually fallen.

“Workers are still very anxious about their economic security,” said Andrew Stettner, interim director of the National Employment Law Project in New York.
The biggest job losses were concentrated in housing, which has been hit hard this year by the collapse of the real estate bubble.

The greatest concern continues to revolve around whether the real estate downturn and the subprime mortgage crisis will ripple out to inflict damage on the broader economy.
Yesterday’s data lent credence to such fears.

Yet by the middle of this year, those two areas were shedding about 25,000 jobs each month.

In the first 11 months of this year, the rate has dropped to 118,000 a month.

Thomas Jefferson saw those words as “building a wall of separation between church and state.” So, much later, did John F. Kennedy, who in a speech predating Romney’s by 47 years, declared: “I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.”

The absolute has proved porous.
The U.S. culture wars have produced what David Campbell of Notre Dame University called: “the injection of religion into politics in a very overt way.”
Much too overt for Europeans, whose alarm at George W. Bush’s presidency has been fed by his allusions to divine guidance — “the hand of a just and faithful God” in shaping events, or his trust in “the ways of Providence.”
Such beliefs seem to remove decision-making from the realm of the rational at the very moment when the West’s enemy acts in the name of fanatical theocracy.
At worst, they produce references to a “crusade” against those jihadist enemies.
God-given knowledge is scarcely amenable to oversight.

Of course, the religious heritage of which Romney spoke is real.
Indeed, the devastating European experience of religious war influenced the founders’ thinking.
That is why I find Romney’s speech and the society it reflects far more troubling than Europe’s vacant cathedrals.
Romney allows no place in the United States for atheists.
He opines that, “Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom.” Yet secular Sweden is free while religious Iran is not.
Buddhism, among other great Oriental religions, is forgotten.

He shows a Wikipedia-level appreciation of other religions, admiring “the commitment to frequent prayer of the Muslims” and “the ancient traditions of the Jews.” These vapid nostrums suggest his innermost conviction of America’s true faith.
A devout Christian vision emerges of a U.S. society that is in fact increasingly diverse.
Romney rejects the “religion of secularism,” of which Europe tends to be proud.
But he should consider that Washington is well worth a Mass.
The fires of the Reformation that reduced St. Andrews Cathedral to ruin are fires of faith that endure in different, but no less explosive, forms.
Jefferson’s “wall of separation” must be restored if those who would destroy the West’s Enlightenment values are to be defeated.

Even if the rumor is false, it can break the bank.
If everyone, believing that the bank is about to go bust, demands their money out at the same time, the bank would have to raise cash by selling off assets at fire-sale prices — and it may indeed go bust even though it didn’t really make that bum loan.

And because loss of confidence can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, even depositors who don’t believe the rumor would join in the bank run, trying to get their money out while they can.
But the Fed can come to the rescue.
If the rumor is false, the bank has enough assets to cover its debts; all it lacks is liquidity — the ability to raise cash on short notice.
And the Fed can solve that problem by giving the bank a temporary loan, tiding it over until things calm down.
Matters are very different, however, if the rumor is true: the bank really did make a big bad loan.
Then the problem isn’t how to restore confidence; it’s how to deal with the fact that the bank is really, truly insolvent, that is, busted.

And the reason is that this time the financial system — both banks and, probably even more important, nonbank financial institutions — made a lot of loans that are likely to go very, very bad.
It’s easy to get lost in the details of subprime mortgages, resets, collateralized debt obligations, and so on.
But there are two important facts that may give you a sense of just how big the problem is.

To restore a historically normal ratio of housing prices to rents or incomes, average home prices would have to fall about 30 percent from their current levels.
Second, there was a tremendous amount of borrowing into the bubble, as new home buyers purchased houses with little or no money down, and as people who already owned houses refinanced their mortgages as a way of converting rising home prices into cash.

As home prices come back down to earth, many of these borrowers will find themselves with negative equity — owing more than their houses are worth.
Negative equity, in turn, often leads to foreclosures and big losses for lenders.

And the numbers are huge.
The financial blog Calculated Risk, using data from First American CoreLogic, estimates that if home prices fall 20 percent there will be 13.7 million homeowners with negative equity.
If prices fall 30 percent, that number would rise to more than 20 million.
That translates into a lot of losses, and explains why liquidity has dried up.
What’s going on in the markets isn’t an irrational panic.
It’s a wholly rational panic, because there’s a lot of bad debt out there, and you don’t know how much of that bad debt is held by the guy who wants to borrow your money.
How will it all end?
Markets won’t start functioning normally until investors are reasonably sure that they know where the bodies — I mean, the bad debts — are buried.
And that probably won’t happen until house prices have finished falling and financial institutions have come clean about all their losses.
All of this will probably take years.

Meanwhile, anyone who expects the Fed or anyone else to come up with a plan that makes this financial crisis just go away will be sorely disappointed.
Fast forward to last week, when, with great fanfare, the White House announced a plan that encourages mortgage lenders to give across-the-board breaks to a certain category of subprime borrowers who are in danger of losing their homes.
The lead dog in unveiling the complicated plan was Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
It was under his auspices that all the various mortgage constituents — loan originators, holders of mortgage-backed securities, servicers, and representatives of the borrowers — met and agreed on the plan.

Mr. Paulson is also the one being praised by those who are happy to see the administration finally doing something about the subprime crisis — and criticized by both those who say it does too little, and others who believe that the federal government should stay out of it entirely and let the parties take their lumps, no matter what the consequences.
(Those are the so-called liar loans)

Particularly troubling to her was a series of popular adjustable-rate mortgages — loans with teaser interest rates of, say, 7 percent that would reset within a year or two at much higher interest rates.
“That could often bring a payment shock of 30 to 40 percent,” she said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The truth is, when these loans were made, nobody ever expected that they would be repaid.
Instead, the widespread assumption was that they would be refinanced before the reset ever kicked in.
Why?
Because widespread foreclosures would be bad for everybody.

The holders of the debt — primarily Wall Street, which holds the complex securities into which subprime mortgages were bundled — would at least get some money if the loans were modified, instead of nothing.
Homeowners would get to stay in the homes and make payments they could afford, while waiting for the market to recover.
They hurt entire neighborhoods.
Vacant properties contribute to crime.
And they hurt the economy at large.”

Once upon a time, loan modifications would be made by bankers who met with the borrowers and hammered out new terms.
But now that loan originators sell the mortgages to Wall Street, that is no longer possible.
So in March, the F.D.I.C.
held a series of “securitization round tables,” essentially an effort to jawbone debtholders into agreeing to freeze the starter interest rate, instead of allowing the reset rate to go into effect.

“We have a huge problem on our hands,” she said.
She continued: “For owner-occupied housing where the loan is current, just convert the subprime hybrid A.R.M.
into a fixed-rate mortgage.
Keep it at the starter rate.
Convert it into a fixed rate.
Make it permanent.
Ultimately, the voluntary plan announced last week by Mr. Paulson is narrower than Ms. Bair’s idea; it will freeze the resets for five years, instead of permanently.
And most experts I spoke to believe it will probably cover, at most, only 300,000 of the 1.7 million mortgages that are due for resets over the next few years.

Some of these exclusions make obvious sense — anyone who got a subprime mortgage to buy a second home won’t be eligible, for instance.
Other caveats don’t make much sense at all: eligibility is based in part on credit scores, and people with poorer credit will make the cut while those with very good credit won’t.
“People will rearrange their circumstance to meet the criteria,” predicted Peter D. Schiff, the author of “Crash Proof: How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse.”
Still, says Daniel Alpert, the managing director of Westwood Capital, “It’s a Band-Aid.” And thus the real question: Should the government be doing more to help the people who took on subprime loans and now face foreclosure?
It is a hard question to answer.
Many of the sweeping relief plans floated by Democrats ignore the fact that many people who got liar loans were speculators searching for the quick score — and many others simply lacked the financial means to be homeowners.

There is also a surprising amount of opposition to even the limited plan put forth by Mr. Paulson.
I’ve been struck, for instance, by the groundswell of resentment from homeowners who did not speculate or get caught up in the housing bubble — and who now feel that people who acted irresponsibly are getting a break they don’t deserve.
The problem, however, is that Ms. Bair is right about the potential consequences of doing nothing at all.
“But if the alternative is that the economy will be crushed, I don’t see why the rest of us have to pay for that” just to make a point to those who overreached.

And then there are the real fire-breathers like Mr. Schiff, who think any government intervention is too much.
“The people in those homes who can’t afford to pay the mortgage have no right to be in them,” he said sternly.
“They have no means to pay for it.
They don’t get squatters’ rights.
If they’re foreclosed on, they won’t be homeless.
There is an ample supply of rental properties.”
I suppose.
But I like Ms. Bair’s analysis better.
“Sometimes,” she said, adding a final rationale for her idea, “I think you have to have some compassion.”
Sometimes you do.
THE economy faces a vicious downward spiral of foreclosures, declining property values and mounting losses on mortgage-backed securities and related financial assets.
The resetting of interest rates on more than 2 million subprime loans will prompt a large number of foreclosures, perhaps a million a year in both 2008 and 2009.
These huge waves of foreclosures will depress the price of residential real estate still further.
Plummeting real estate values and escalating foreclosures will cause further losses on mortgage-related securities and will further burden American consumers already dealing with higher energy prices and substantial debt.
Given the dampening effects of these developments on both consumption and investment spending, it is increasingly likely that the economy will slip into recession next year.
The Federal Reserve should continue to cut interest rates and to experiment with new ways to pump liquidity into the financial system.
The Bush administration’s plan for a voluntary freeze by lenders on interest-rate resets for a small fraction of subprime loans has been judged inadequate by the financial markets.
Bolder measures — a temporary moratorium on foreclosures on subprime owner-occupied homes, a freeze on interest rate resets for subprime adjustable rate mortgages, and federal funds to help at-risk borrowers to stay in their homes and at-risk communities to reduce foreclosures — are required to contain the potential damage to the overall economy from the crisis in the housing and mortgage markets.

L’Express said on its Web site that the couple seemed very relaxed on Saturday as about 10 professional photographers snapped away.
Pascal Rostain, a photographer who has photographed Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Bruni together in recent days, told LCI on Monday, “She is living a true love story, the president as well,” adding, “They have nothing to hide.”
Some commentators noted the unease some French feel for what is called the “people-ization” of French politics by Mr. Sarkozy, in which private life is selectively used in public life.

“Some people are amused by this story because Sarkozy seems to have bounced back after the divorce,” Michèle Fitoussi, one of France’s leading social commentators and a columnist at the French edition of Elle magazine, said in a telephone interview.
“But a lot of people are fed up that he is so obsessed by his image, obsessed with being the center of attention, especially at a time when the French are worried about serious issues like the sad state of the economy.”

Less than two months ago, Mr. Sarkozy and his wife, Cécilia, announced their divorce after 11 years of marriage.
Ms. Bruni, like the former Mrs. Sarkozy, is a high-cheekboned, pale-eyed brunette and former fashion model taller than Mr. Sarkozy.
Cécilia Sarkozy, however, is 53; Ms. Bruni will turn either 39 or 40 (accounts differ) on Sunday.

The conservative daily Le Figaro, one of several newspapers to feature the story on Monday, ran a front-page color photo of a smiling Ms. Bruni under the headline, “Carla Bruni, the friend of the president.” It used the word “amie,” which can also mean girlfriend.
“Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni wanted to make this known, otherwise I don’t know why they would have gone to Euro Disney to watch a parade with Mickey Mouse,” Colombe Pringle, editorial director of Point de Vue, a gossip magazine that plans a cover spread on the subject this week, told France Inter radio on Monday.

LCI, the all-news television channel, devoted much of Monday morning to the story, largely ignoring the international donors’ conference for the Palestinians, for which Mr. Sarkozy was the host.
During a call-in period, a number of French callers expressed delight that their president may have found love again.
“And what does he choose as a relaxation spot?
Her most recent recording early this year, an interpretation of famous English-language poets like W. B. Yeats and Emily Dickinson, was not a commercial success.
In the novel, Ms. Levy describes a woman who is “beautiful and bionic, with the look of a killer,” a “terminator.”
The resolution was nonbinding; its symbolic weight made barely a ripple in the news ocean of the United States, where governments’ right to kill a killer is enshrined in law and custom.
But for those who have been trying to move the world away from lethal revenge as government policy, this was a milestone.
Progress has come in Europe and Africa.
Nations like Senegal, Burundi, Gabon — even Rwanda, shamed by genocide — have decided to reject the death penalty, as official barbarism.
Together this blood brotherhood accounts for more than 90 percent of the world’s executions, according to Amnesty International.
These countries’ devotion to their sovereignty is rigid, as is their perverse faith in execution as a criminal deterrent and an instrument of civilized justice.
But out beyond Texas, Ohio, Virginia, Myanmar, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and Zimbabwe, there are growing numbers who expect better of humanity.
Many are not nations or states but groups of regular people, organizations like the Community of Sant’Egidio, a lay Catholic movement begun in Italy whose advocacy did much to bring about this week’s successful vote in the General Assembly.
They are motivated by hope — and there is even some in the United States.
The Supreme Court will soon hear debate on the cruelty of execution by lethal injection.
Mr. Kibaki, 76, is vintage old guard.
He is from Kenya’s dominant tribe, the Kikuyu; he has been a member of Parliament since Kenya’s independence in 1963, and he is a reliable friend of big business and the United States (his campaign ads are even red, white and blue).

Mr. Odinga seems different.
For starters, he is Luo, one of the country’s largest tribes, but one that many Kenyans say has never gotten its due.
Although Kenya has one of the most mature democracies in Africa, many Kenyans still vote along tribal lines.
Kenya’s 37 million people are split among some 40 distinct ethnic groups.
And unlike many politicians who would rather not acknowledge tribal frictions, Mr. Odinga is confronting them head on and has made inclusion and an end to discrimination the cornerstones of his campaign.
“Ethnicity is the disease of the elite,“ he says, adding that throughout Kenya’s history, money, land and opportunity have been sprinkled around unequally, based on tribe.

But it is not as if Mr. Odinga is working class.
In 1982, he was accused of plotting a coup against the president at the time, Daniel arap Moi and spent eight years in jail, where he was beaten and tortured.
Since then, his Marxist politics have mellowed, though he still talks a big proletarian game.
He promises to focus on poverty, unemployment and corruption.
The big question is, if he wins how much will Kenya change?
The economy has been humming along, with a growth rate around 7 percent and a billion-dollar-a-year tourism industry.
And there is peace, which is nothing to sneeze at in a neighborhood that includes war-racked Somalia, Sudan and Congo.

Macharia Gaitho, a managing editor at The Daily Nation, Kenya’s biggest newspaper, does not think Mr. Odinga will disrupt that stability.
“I see a Jekyll and Hyde character,” Mr. Gaitho said.
“He can set himself up as a populist leader who responds to the masses.
But on the other level he is very pragmatic.
He is a businessman, with ties across all ethnic lines.”

But some voters, especially Kikuyus, argue that Mr. Odinga profits from tribalism as much as he rails against it.

“Even if Kibaki could have improved this economy by 80 percent, believe you me, the people in Raila’s tribe, they would not vote for him, because they are kinsmen,” said Andrew Macharia, who is running for a city council seat in the capital, Nairobi.
“It’s a sorry state that our politics are tribal-based.”
The president’s inner circle has accused Mr. Odinga of making promises he cannot keep.
Amos Kimunya, the finance minister, dismissed Mr. Odinga’s economic plans as “domonomics,” a play on the Swahili word for mouth and meaning something like “talk economics.” Mr. Odinga’s proposals “will cause debt to balloon, interest rates and inflation to rise,” Mr. Kimunya wrote in a recent opinion piece.

The neck-and-neck race between Mr. Odinga and Mr. Kibaki shows how far Kenya’s democracy has come from just a decade ago, when it was still under the grip of Mr. Moi, who has been widely criticized as a dictator and who is campaigning for Mr. Kibaki.
Today, there is a free press, 2,548 candidates running for Parliament and genuine issues separating the leading parties, like strong central government versus federalism.
Electoral politics here are not saddled by the deep cynicism that dogs Nigeria, Africa’s most populous democracy, or the one-party rule of South Africa, the continent’s most developed country.

Mr. Odinga, who has been a member of Parliament for the last 15 years, has taken full advantage of Kenya’s open system and used his flair for appealing to the masses to reel in millions of Kenyans who feel marginalized by the Kikuyu elite.
He has also charmed many Muslims upset at the Kibaki government’s crackdowns in Muslim areas as part of its counterterrorism campaign.
“The best way to explain this is not who is popular but who is so unpopular,” said Chweya Ludeki, a political science professor at the University of Nairobi.
“Raila’s harvesting from Kibaki’s unpopularity and the perception that the president has favored his ethnic group.”

Though the cabinet includes members of many tribes, the ministries that matter — like defense, justice, finance and internal security — are all run by Kikuyus.
The government’s response has been that it hires the most qualified people.

Many of Mr. Odinga’s supporters are worried that these politicians might try to steal the election.
There have also been some cheap shots.
Circumcision is a rite of passage in many tribes, including the Kikuyu, but not the Luo.
If a man is not circumcised, the whisper campaign goes, then he is not a real man.

Still, Mr. Odinga draws thousands of fans to his rallies.

It was a jostling mass of orange — orange hats, orange T-shirts, orange shopping bags, even orange shukas, the signature cloaks Maasai herders wear.
Orange is the official color of Mr. Odinga’s party, the Orange Democratic Movement, and Nalanju Punyua, a woman selling sodas, said Mr. Odinga looked fabulous in it.

“We want to empower consumers to make informed real estate decisions and help them cut their mortgage transaction costs,” Mr. Kratzer said.

Indeed, while consumers can book travel arrangements, trade stocks and otherwise shop intelligently online, comparing costs associated with a mortgage has not been easy to do on the Internet.
Much of the process is shrouded in mystery until the last moment, when it is time to close on a property.
By giving borrowers a way to compare early on what they will probably pay for a mortgage in commissions, points, interest rates and fees, the founders of FeeDisclosure.com say they hope to bring transparency to what is not only a mind-numbing process but also the biggest financial commitment a consumer typically makes.
EVERY year, for example, home buyers pay an estimated $50 billion in transaction fees when they take out mortgages.
Some $17 billion of that consists of junk fees charged by lenders, Mr. Kratzer said.
Items like $100 e-mail charges, $75 document preparation fees and $25 FedEx charges are common.

But other elements can also add to borrowers’ costs — like hidden relationships between service providers, appraisers and lenders.
The fee disclosure Web site helps consumers identify both junk fees and hidden relationships, and it costs consumers nothing.

First, the site’s fee analyzer lets a borrower assess the data from a good-faith estimate supplied by a potential lender and see if the fees are excessive.
Such estimates include fees for hazard insurance, document preparation, lawyers’ services, appraisals and other items.

The fee analyzer gives borrowers a range of fees charged for those services and a national average.
It also provides a tool to help the borrower negotiate fees, Mr. Zimmerman noted.
“By simply asking the questions, the fees will come down,” he said.
“This is a baseline for people to educate themselves.”

Consumers can also go a step further.
In the top 50 metropolitan areas (the site plans to add more) prospective borrowers can ask their real estate broker or banker to give them a fee disclosure report that the professional generates from the Web site after feeding it data.
This is a plain-English description of a loan’s terms and costs, describing the type of loan — adjustable rate or fixed — and whether there is a prepayment penalty, for example.
The report also compares the fees levied in the transaction with national averages.
Each fee is described and identified as either common or not, giving consumers a place to start negotiating for lower or fewer charges.
In addition to fees, relationships that may exist among the different providers are noted.
A sample copy of a fee disclosure report can be found on the Web site.
The service is driven by some 30,000 real estate professionals who have signed up with FeeDisclosure.com to supply data about their offerings, including fees they charge, services they provide and affiliations.
More professionals are signing up every day, including lenders, notaries, appraisers, real estate brokers, mortgage brokers and providers of hazard insurance.

The site does not participate in consumers’ real estate or mortgage transactions and does not collect a commission or payment on the transactions.
It earns money from real estate professionals in two ways.
First, it charges brokers and real estate agents $99 a year to join the site; those who want their companies and services highlighted on the service pay an additional $49 a year.

By joining the site, the professionals get exposure to prospective borrowers and home buyers.
As the FeeDisclosure.com site grows, so does competition.
To help keep vendors on the site accountable to consumers, it also has a rating mechanism for participants to rank the real estate professionals they used, on six factors, including service, accuracy and expertise.

To be sure, none of the site’s disclosures are meant to replace regulatory documents that also are legally required to be given to borrowers.
But the site’s extra information can help borrowers get advance warning of costs and allow them to chisel away at unnecessary or high fees before they are seated around the loan closing table and under the gun.
The site also allows consumers to name the fees they are willing to pay and see which service providers may be willing to work with them.
“People are very distraught about what the industry is doing to them,” Mr. Zimmerman said.

The fact that Christmas almost coincided this year with the Muslim holiday Id al-Adha may have prompted more emigrants to return.
In other ways, it is an ominous time: Lebanon has been without a president since Nov. 23, when Émile Lahoud stepped down without any agreement on a successor.
Since then, Parliament has delayed voting on a new president 10 times, and negotiations have grown steadily more rancorous.

Mr. Hasbini, who works for a television and film equipment company in Jidda, waved it all aside.

For some families, Lebanon has become little more than a reunion site.
“We’re all here for the holidays but none of us live here anymore,” said Maria Pamoukian, 28, an urban planner based in Abu Dhabi who was born in Beirut.
There are 10 people in the family — seven adults and three children — she added, all now scattered across the globe, though they still maintain a big apartment here.
Beirutis like Mr. Masri are too hardened by years of civil war to be intimidated by a bombing.

But there is a corollary to this ritual of return: much of the middle class — including many of its best and brightest — no longer live in Lebanon.
The pace of emigration appears to have picked up after the violence of the 2006 war with Israel and the political crisis that has followed, said Guita Hourani, a sociologist at Notre Dame University in Zouk Mosbeh, north of Beirut, who has studied migration patterns.
The oil wealth in the gulf region has also helped lure away more young Lebanese.
“Gulf companies come here and poach people from banks and other sectors.
They recruit whole classes of graduating seniors.”
These migrants supply Lebanon with about $1,400 per capita every year, Mr. Ghobril said — one of the highest rates of remittances in the world.
Those transfers are one of the pillars sustaining the consumer economy, he added, though they do not make up for the country’s soaring public debt, the lack of long-term investment here, or the slow bleeding of the country’s main natural resource — its people.

But there is another way of looking at it.

The latest rain had only a small effect on the metropolitan area’s main source of drinking water, Lake Lanier, where the receding water is exposing roads and the foundations of buildings submerged since the reservoir was created in the 1950s.

“What’s falling now won’t show up until tomorrow or the next day,” said Rob Holland, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates the reservoir.

“Anything that stops the level from falling is a good thing,” Mr. Holland added.
“But we’d like to get a whole lot more.”
The lack of rainfall across the region has set off intense fighting among Georgia, Florida and Alabama over the federal government’s management of water in the region.
Gov.
Sonny Perdue of Georgia has asked the federal government to release less water from its reservoirs, like Lanier, but Alabama and Florida are concerned about how that would affect their supplies.

Ultra-safe Treasuries and risky emerging markets both rewarded investors.
Including dividends and interest payments, the S.& P. returned 6.2 percent while a Merrill Lynch index that tracks government-backed debt returned 8.5 percent.
A Merrill Lynch index that tracks floating-rate securities backed by home loans fell 10.9 percent through November, after including interest payments.
MBIA, a company that guarantees those debts, fell 74.5 percent for the year.
Other areas of the market rose, but the decline in these two big sectors hurt benchmark indexes.
Together the sectors accounted for about one-third of the stock market’s valuation at the start of 2007; they account for about one-fourth now.
Billions of dollars flowed from the developed world into fast-developing economies in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe.
“Typically, you would expect in a flight to safety that investors would flee emerging markets,” Mr. Peta said.
“That they haven’t shows that there is a strong desire to invest in growth.”
The growth in developing economies also has helped propel the prices of commodities like oil (up 58 percent), wheat (68 percent) and gold (31 percent).
And the United States dollar has fallen against many currencies, including the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar.

Many investors believe that the slower growth of the American economy will not hobble its trading partners in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
Their view also reflects a belief that the dollar will continue to sink, making stocks elsewhere more attractive.
From the start of 2007 through Dec. 26, investors had put $141 billion into foreign equity funds, compared with just $49 billion in domestic stock funds, according to AMG Data Services, a research firm.

But some specialists are unsure that developing economies, many of which rely heavily on exports to developed countries, will continue to thrive.
Bernard Connolly, the global strategist for Banque A.I.G.
“World demand, which has been extremely buoyant for a couple of years, is visibly melting away,” Mr. Connolly said.
“Sitting here in London, it’s very easy to see.”
Mr. Levkovich of Citigroup said he was also concerned that foreign stock markets might be overvalued.
But unlike Mr. Connolly he is more upbeat about the American stock market, at least through the first six months of the new year.
In the second half of the year, he worries, corporate profit margins could come under pressure.
Mr. Levkovich also asserts that most American stocks are not overvalued as they were in 2000 at the height of the tech boom.
The price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500 index, for instance, stands at 18.6, down from 30 in early 2000 but still higher than the long-run average of about 16.
The stock market, he said, has punished companies that were most closely tied to the mortgage mess but has been kind to others, a pattern he thinks will continue.
“Equity markets didn’t have the same kind of bubble conditions that the credit markets had.”
Still, the stock market’s fate will be closely tied to the housing and credit markets, specialists say.
The economy will be most vulnerable if banks are not willing to lend to businesses and consumers with good credit histories.
Without access to capital, businesses will not be able to expand or invest in new products.
It would also be hard for consumers to move for new jobs and pay for education and training.
“The linchpin for the U.S. is how quickly do the credit markets behave normally,” said Robert C. Doll, vice chairman at BlackRock, the asset management company.
In an indication that at least some parts of the market are beginning to unlock, the interest rates banks charge one another to borrow have been falling since the Federal Reserve started lending to banks through a new auction system in mid-December.

The three-month interbanking lending rate fell to 4.7 percent Monday, from 5.1 percent on Dec. 11.
The difference between that rate and the cost at which the federal government borrows also fell over the same period, to 1.5 percentage points on Monday from 2.2 percentage points, though it remains very high relative to historical norms.
“It’s going to be a challenge getting back to a normalized level,” Mr. Peta said.
But the recent drop “does say to me that things are improving.”
Following are the results of Monday’s auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills.
The bursting housing bubble remains a locus of concern.
An era of free-flowing credit and speculation has led to a far-flung empire of vacant, unsold homes — 2.1 million, or about 2.6 percent of the nation’s housing stock, Mr. Zandi said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
This assemblage of unsold properties will not be whittled down to normal levels, economists suggest, until national home prices fall by at least 15 percent from their peak, reached in the summer of 2006.
So far, prices have dropped a little more than 5 percent, according to the Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller home price index.
The glut could be exacerbated if an already alarming wave of foreclosures continues to broaden, claiming even those with supposedly good credit.
Nearly one-fourth of such loans were in default as of November, according to data from First American LoanPerformance and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Though default rates on loans to homeowners with relatively good credit are far lower, they are rising sharply, too.
This is a potentially ominous sign, because subprime and Alt-A mortgages issued in 2006 together made up about 40 percent of all mortgages.
Like many of the subprime loans that have landed in trouble, Alt-A loans often begin with a low introductory interest rate that later escalates.
The spike in foreclosures is happening even before many mortgages have reset to higher rates, suggesting that borrowers are falling behind because their homes are worth less.
Many are having trouble refinancing as banks tighten lending standards.
All of which explains why many economists expect national housing prices to fall by 5 to 10 percent more in 2008, and perhaps into 2009 as well, before hitting bottom.
Such a drop could ripple out to the broader economy by depressing consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of all economic activity.

“It’s almost inconceivable that there won’t be severe constraints on the U.S. consumer economy,” said Bernard Connolly, chief global strategist at Banque AIG in London.
Through the recent era of multiplying housing prices, Americans have turned increased home values into cash via sales, refinanced mortgages and home equity loans — more than $800 billion a year from 2004 to 2006, according to several analysts.
The pace of this flow has slowed sharply in recent months.
Fierce debate centers on how much of that money winds up financing consumer purchases, but estimates suggest that every dollar of lost housing value is likely to constrain 5 to 10 cents of spending by consumers that otherwise would have taken place over the next year or two.
That could be enough to turn an expansion into an recession.

Forecasting the demise of consumer spending, however, is notoriously risky.
The willingness of Americans to spend, whatever the size of their debts, seems to transcend the rules of economics.
But conditions suggesting a slowdown have been taking shape: The labor market cooled last year, creating new jobs at roughly half the rate of 2006.
Early indications suggest Americans were relatively thrifty during the holiday season.
“You have to ask yourself: where does the consumer continue to get his or her spending power?” said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
“If consumption falters, it’s good night nurse for the American economy.”
This is what many economists deem the most plausible of the negative situations that could unfold in 2008: Housing prices fall, consumers tighten up, and companies eliminate jobs in response to declining business, particularly in retailing, restaurants and travel.
Companies curtail investments, cutting jobs in real estate, construction and banking.
This takes more money out of the economy, generating a downward spiral of declining activity.
In a word, recession.
Those focused on this prospect are concerned by the weakening job market and recent increases in those filing for unemployment claims.
In a report last month, Ian Morris, United States economist for HSBC, predicted that unemployment would climb to 5.3 by the end of 2008, up from an average of 4.7 percent in 2007, with the economy generating only about 40,000 nonfarm jobs each month — about one-third the pace for most of 2007.

The prospect of such a development has spurred the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times since September, bringing its benchmark rate down to 4.25 percent from 5.25 percent.
Cheaper credit generally lubricates the wheels of the economy by encouraging investment and spending.
The Fed has expressed reluctance to continue cutting because of concerns about inflation.
But further signs of economic trouble will impel it to keep lowering borrowing costs.
And if oil and other commodity prices fall enough this year to dampen fears of inflation, that would give the Fed room to cut interest rates more aggressively.
The economy is rife with surprises, and unexpected good news could step in to provide relief.
American consumers, despite their general gloom about the economy, continue to express satisfaction with their personal finances.
That could carry the day, as they tap credit cards to finance meals out and trips to the mall, even as housing wealth dries up.
Added support for the economy is likely to come from abroad, sustaining rising exports, which have been propelled by healthy growth everywhere from China and India to Europe and the Middle East.
The weak dollar helps make American products more competitive in foreign markets.
A combination of any of these factors might be enough to generate jobs and keep the economy going, regardless of real estate troubles.
Moreover, some economists assert that worries about the housing market are overblown in terms of the effect on the broader economy.
While bad news seems certain to continue for real estate agents, construction companies, home improvement stores and anyone else with fortunes tied to demand for garages and ceramic tiles, the economy can continue to grow even with house prices in the doldrums, they say.
In this view, the crucial factor is the availability of credit.
The mortgage crisis has made markets skittish about the extent of losses still hiding in the weeds.
Lenders have been casting a wary eye at potential borrowers, diminishing the flow of credit to support everything from car purchases to the development of office towers.
If the Fed’s lowered interest rates do the trick, making banks feel more secure, an upward spiral could commence, as fresh lending spurs business and keeps the economy growing.
But if jitters persist and banks remain tight, that could snuff out business, cut jobs and send the economy into a tailspin.
“If the credit card is a little harder to come by, that means there’s a little less shopping going on,” said Neal Soss, an economist at Credit Suisse Securities in New York.
“If banks go into hibernation and there’s no cash for anybody, then it’s very hard to get the economy to grow with any vigor.”

Western diplomats, who have been putting enormous pressure on Kenya’s government and opposition leaders to negotiate and bring an end to the bloodletting that has killed more than 300 people in the past three days, said the two sides remained locked in a standoff.

Within the span of a week, one of the most developed, promising countries in Africa has turned into a starter kit for disaster.
Tribal militias are roaming the countryside with rusty machetes, neighborhoods are pulling apart, and Kenya’s economy, one of the biggest on the continent, is unraveling — with fuel shortages rippling across East Africa because the roads in Kenya, a regional hub, are too dangerous to use.
Roadblocks set up by armed men, something synonymous with anarchic Somalia, have cropped up across the country, in towns on the savannah and in the cramped slums.
Kenya’s president, Mwai Kibaki, who was declared the victor by a narrow margin on Sunday despite widespread evidence of ballot rigging, has rejected the opposition’s offers for outside mediation.
“Are we in a civil war?
Is this Somalia?
“Our problem is with some hooligans.
Adding to the incendiary atmosphere, Raila Odinga, the opposition figure who said he was robbed of the presidency, has vowed to go ahead with a million-person rally in the capital, Nairobi, on Thursday.
The government has said the rally is illegal, and busloads of police officers in helmets and padded suits have begun to muster downtown.
“We want to appeal directly to the people,” Mr. Odinga said on Wednesday.
Many Kenyans are worried the rally will turn into an enormous brawl.

The Bush administration said that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was calling both sides to urge them to do everything they could to end the violence, and the United Nations issued a statement on Wednesday saying that Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general, was “concerned with the deteriorating humanitarian situation, as large numbers of people have been displaced by the violence.”

The Red Cross estimates that nearly 100,000 people have fled their homes.
Some have even crossed into Uganda.
Kenya historically has been a country that accepts refugees, not creates them.
The fighting is especially brutal in the Rift Valley, which is ethnically divided between tribes that support the president and tribes that back the opposition.
In Kiambaa, a village in the Rift Valley about a five-hour drive from Nairobi, the tensions boil down to Kalenjin, the biggest tribe in this area, and Luo, the tribe of Mr. Odinga, versus Kikuyu, Mr. Kibaki’s tribe.
In Nairobi, the slums exploded, with crowds hurling rocks at police officers and burning down Kikuyu businesses.
In the Rift Valley, where the tawny veldt meets lush green farms, and mountains loom on both sides, Kalenjins and Luos began hunting down the outnumbered Kikuyus.
Kenya is a mosaic of some 40 tribes, and for most of its history, they have intermarried and gotten along fine.
That is one reason the country has enjoyed decades of stability, avoiding the turbulent fate of neighbors like Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan and Rwanda.
But this election, the first competitive one between political heavyweights from different tribes, seems to have cracked open a new divide.
“A church is supposed to be safe.”

“Predicting oil prices continually demonstrates the perils of prophecy, because oil prices are the derivative of what happens in the global economy and global geopolitics,” said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
Mr. Yergin said he could foresee oil prices surging as high as $150 in the next few years or falling as low as $40.
“We have to make investments based on our outlook over a long period of time,” he said.
“It is tough.”
Central to the question of where oil prices will go is the effect of high prices on the consumption and development of alternative fuels.
Large amounts of public and private investment are going into solar, wind and biofuel development, but so far they are making only a slight contribution to energy supplies.
Scientific and engineering leaps, like developing the atomic bomb or sending a man to the moon, can be made relatively quickly, but they are still measured in years.
Until now, most economists have been surprised that the rise in oil prices — from as low as $11 less than a decade ago — has not had a greater effect on American consumers.
But with oil prices rising at an increasingly rapid rate over the last few months in conjunction with the housing market slump and credit squeeze, many economists now wonder whether oil prices could tip the economy into a recession.
A recession, of course, would curb oil demand.
That would push oil prices right back down again, or so the theory goes, as fewer consumers drive to the mall, companies produce and ship less and world trade slows.

“If we are slowing down, we will not be buying as much goods from China and services from India,” said Addison Armstrong, director for market research at Tradition Energy, an energy broker that deals with banks and hedge funds.
“My forecast for 2008 is that crude prices will average $75 a barrel, and that is based on a scenario of a slowing economy in the United States.”
But Mr. Armstrong and other experts cautioned that a protracted insurgency in Nigeria, a punishing hurricane season or other unpredictable events could take oil prices up even more.
So why are oil prices going up now?
The military situation in Iraq is arguably improving, and Iraqi oil exports are beginning to flow again.
Tensions with Iran have eased a bit.
There are forecasts for a mild late winter in the United States, which should help bolster oil and gasoline inventories going into the spring and summer driving season.

Many experts say the answer lies in the investment decisions of traders and hedge funds.
With the markets in equities, housing, credit and currency shaky in the United States, traders are betting on oil and other commodities as a perceived safe haven.
But most experts say that if oil prices do go down, they will probably not go down very far or for very long.
Mr. Richels of Devon Energy said that consumers in Europe and Japan were not feeling the same pressure as Americans because their currencies have been strengthening and not weakening.
“There is still a lot of demand that is outside of the United States,” Mr. Richels said.
“There is increasing oil consumption, particularly in the developing nations, and oil is getting more difficult to find.”
It is not an easy time of year to sit in a tree in Dresden, where lately the temperature has stayed consistently below freezing.

Prior to World War II, Dresden was known as “Florence on the Elbe” for its exceptional baroque and rococo architecture.
But in the aftermath of a devastating series of Allied bombing raids in 1945, the city began a long struggle to rebuild.
For Dresdeners, the World Heritage status is thus a particular point of pride.
However, the official Unesco designation is Dresden Elbe Valley, which covers not just the city’s buildings but also its parklands and greenbelts along the river.
Leading a protest against the bridge here last month, Mr. Grass, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature for such works as “The Tin Drum,” said that the history of the city’s destruction meant that “one must be particularly angry and alert that this form of destruction is never repeated.”
Opponents have tried several ways to stop the bridge from going up.
Experts estimate that only around 650 remain in Germany, some in the vicinity of the proposed bridge.

In December, protesters held a sit-in around several old oak trees that had survived the World War II bombing raids to prevent workers from chopping them down.
Their action failed, leading a few days later to the more drastic pre-dawn seizure of the beech tree by the activists.
Environmentalists from Robin Wood arrived at 5:30 a.m. on Dec. 12, set up camp in and around the beech tree and have been there ever since.
Wood platforms, about eight feet long and three and a half feet wide, were suspended from the stronger branches using a pulley-and-anchor system.

“I’m for it,” Doreen Kaufhold, 20, a bookkeeper, said of the bridge as she waited for a streetcar in downtown Dresden.
“It would be a relief for traffic.” In Saxony, although the population has dropped, car ownership per capita has risen even faster, to 546 per 1,000 residents last year from 423 per 1,000 in 1994.
Indeed officials are surprised that it has become an issue.
Planners are hoping to sway Unesco with modifications that would make the bridge less obtrusive, allowing them to have their crossing and their heritage standing too.

“We hope that with these changes we can reach a point where Unesco finds it acceptable and we can maintain the World Heritage status,” said Michael Sagurna, a senior official in the Saxony state government.
“We’re fairly sure that with these changes the dispute won’t be quite so heated as before.”
That he was black, born in 1745 to a white planter and his slave mistress in Guadeloupe, not only shaped his life in France but has fed a growing interest in him today.
“He’s not a Mozart, but his innovative violin technique makes him a bridge between Italian virtuosos like Vivaldi and Locatelli and Beethoven in his violin writing,” Mr. Banat said in an interview in his home here.
(His second symphony will be performed on April 12 and 13 by the Stamford Symphony Orchestra at the Palace Theater in Stamford.)
Mr. Banat, who had an acclaimed solo career before becoming a 23-year member of the New York Philharmonic, considers Saint-Georges the first significant black classical composer.
Now retired, Mr. Banat, 81, has spent years researching and writing about Saint-Georges, who made music in the court of Marie Antoinette and went on to lead a regiment of black soldiers in the French Revolution.

Some of the more innocuous errors about him, Mr. Banat notes in the preface to his biography, include “the year of his birth, the identity of his father, the spelling of his family name and the place where he spent his childhood.” Mr. Banat said that legends of Saint-Georges being a “ladykiller” and Marie Antoinette’s lover were “tinged with racism” because of their insinuations about black male sexuality.
Mr. Banat said he first heard of Saint-Georges in the 1970s while browsing in the New York Public Library for new material for his recitals.
“Chevalier,” a film about Saint-Georges, is now in development by Griot Pictures Entertainment and is scheduled to start production later this year.
Mr. Banat says he is concerned about how the composer will be portrayed.
Sitting at the table in her suburban kitchen, with her four young children tumbling in and out, Ms. O’Brien, 36, seems an unlikely candidate to be food’s Erin Brockovich (who, by the way, has taken Ms. O’Brien under her wing).
She now puts the icon, a green stop sign with an exclamation point, on lunch bags, stickers and even the little charms children use to dress up their Crocs.
Working largely from a laptop on her dining room table, she has looked deep into the perplexing world of childhood food allergies and seen a conspiracy that threatens the health of America’s children.
And, she profoundly believes, it is up to her and parents everywhere to stop it.
Her theory — that the food supply is being manipulated with additives, genetic modification, hormones and herbicides, causing increases in allergies, autism and other disorders in children — is not supported by leading researchers or the largest allergy advocacy groups.
That only feeds Ms. O’Brien’s conviction that the influence of what she sees as the profit-hungry food industry runs deep.
Through creative use of e-mail, relentless inquiry and a persona carefully crafted around the protective mother archetype, Ms. O’Brien has emerged as a populist hero among parents who troll the Internet for any hint about why their children have food allergies.
“You have changed my life ... my diet ... my health ... my spirit ... and I thank YOU,” a father who had lost his teenage daughter to anaphylactic shock told her by e-mail.

Ms. O’Brien encourages people to do what she did: throw out as much nonorganic processed food as you can afford to.
Don’t eat food with ingredients you can’t pronounce.
“It was absolutely terrifying to unearth this story,” she said over lunch at a restaurant in Boulder, Colo. “These big food companies have an intimate relationship with every household in America, and they are making our children sick.
You don’t want to hear that this has actually happened.”
But has it?
Record numbers of parents are heading to doctors concerned that their children are allergic to a long list of foods.
States are passing laws requiring schools to have policies protecting children with food allergies.
But no one knows why the number of allergies seems to be on the rise, or even if they are rising as fast as some believe.
Ms. O’Brien and leading allergy researchers agree that few reliable studies on food allergies exist.
The best estimates suggest that 4 to 8 percent of young children suffer from them, though the reactions tend to grow less serious and less frequent as children grow older.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the number of deaths linked to food allergies at 12 in 2004, the most recent year for which data are available.
However, its statisticians point out that such figures are drawn only from doctors’ notations on death certificates.
Dr. Elizabeth Gleghorn is the director of pediatric gastroenterology at the Children’s Hospital and Research Center in Oakland, Calif. She has been in practice for 20 years, and has noticed a recent increase in eczema, which can indicate food allergies.
But she doesn’t think food allergies are increasing dramatically.

Often, a child might have intolerance to a food and not a true allergy.
But the Internet has afforded more ways for parents to inform themselves and do their own diagnosing, which could add to the popular impression that food allergies are rising at alarming rates, Dr. Gleghorn said.

Many health professionals, though, agree that something is changing.
Among the amalgam of theories that weigh the effects of genetics and environment, the hygiene hypothesis intrigues many researchers.
It holds that children are being exposed to fewer micro-organisms and, as a result, have weaker immune systems.
“But this alone cannot account for the massive relative increase in food allergy compared with other allergic disease such as asthma,” said Dr. Marc E. Rothenberg, the director of allergy and immunology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, the second-largest pediatric research facility in the country.

Could it be that a toxic food environment has made children’s immune systems go haywire?
It’s hard to find an expert in the field who supports Ms. O’Brien’s theory.
“I don’t think it can be proven, so I can’t say scientifically one way or the other,” Dr. Gleghorn said.
Mix the lack of hard data with an increasingly complex food landscape, and you’ve got Robyn O’Brien.
He also has a niece with a peanut allergy.
Mr. Pollan, who said he has no idea if her theories are accurate, asked her to stop telling people he was working with her.
Leveraging brief e-mail exchanges with notable people is an important method that Ms. O’Brien uses to build her universe.
The unlikely mix includes members of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s staff; Mary Alice Stephenson, a host of “America’s Most Smartest Model”; and, recently, Dr. Mehmet Oz, a regular on Oprah Winfrey’s show.

“The fact that people like him and Malcolm Gladwell, presidential campaigns, celebs take the time to reply means a lot as it gives me hope that people are still engaged,” she said in an e-mail message to this reporter.
While some of her contacts, like Mr. Gladwell, an author and a writer for The New Yorker, don’t remember her, the strategy has worked.
But her biggest asset might be a relentless drive to wind together obscure health theories, blog postings and corporate financial statements.
She then posts her analyses on her Web site.
She chides top allergy doctors who are connected to Monsanto, the producer of herbicides and genetically modified seeds.
She asserts that the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, the nation’s leading food allergy advocacy group, is tainted by the money it receives from food manufacturers and peanut growers.
She said the group now has 30,000 members and a $5.6 million budget.
Mrs. Muñoz-Furlong said that she and doctors on her medical board do not believe that genetically modified foods cause food allergies because most children with allergies react to specific foods, like eggs or milk.
And, she said, communicating regularly with industry can help get the word to parents about potential allergens in products, and supporting research to identify causes of allergies helps consumers more than companies.
She also cautioned against taking the advice of people who have no medical training or run Web sites not certified to have reliable medical information.
“She’s a dot-com,” Mrs. Muñoz-Furlong said of Ms. O’Brien.
“It’s completely different than a dot-org.
From the very beginning our intent was education.”

(Ms. O’Brien did recently start a nonprofit foundation to support research that is not tied to the food industry.)
On the days when Ms. O’Brien grows discouraged at being David against the Goliath of Big Food, she turns to the people who believe her.
She is an environmental consultant who is popular on the inspirational lecture circuit.
Ms. Brockovich said her new friend does a great job of arming everyday people with facts, so they can take a stand.
“You don’t have to be a doctor or a scientist to look into whether our food supply is safe,” she said.
Frankly, I think it takes a little bit of being crazy to make a difference in this world.”
Mr. Bush was here on Wednesday, and will go to the Palestinian territories on Thursday, to push Mr. Olmert and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to get serious about their negotiations and their obligations to each other, as written in the first stage of the “road map” outlining steps to be taken.

Appearing with Mr. Olmert after a day of pomp including an English and Hebrew version of “Over the Rainbow” sung by Israeli youngsters, Mr. Bush declared this a “historic moment, a historic opportunity” to overcome the deep skepticism here and elsewhere that the peace efforts begun in Annapolis, Md., in November would succeed.
“I’m under no illusions,” Mr. Bush said after two and a half hours of meetings, including an hour privately with Mr. Olmert.
“It’s going to be hard work.
I fully understand that there’s going to be some painful political compromises.
I fully understand that there’s going to be some tough negotiations, and the role of the United States is to help in those negotiations.
“It’s essential that people understand, America cannot dictate the terms of what a state will look like,” he added.
“The only way to have lasting peace, the only way for an agreement to mean anything is for the two parties to come together and make the difficult choices, but we’ll help and we want to help.”
In interviews before and during Mr. Bush’s visit, officials described the evolution of the deep bond between the leaders, reinforced by their shared views of Israel’s security, and their own political problems in selling their approach to their respective constituencies.
Mr. Bush’s relationship with the two Israeli leaders he has known best, Mr. Sharon and Mr. Olmert, have differed in detail, if not in spirit.
“With Olmert, it’s completely different,” the Israeli official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing private interactions between the leaders.
“They’re the same age.
They’re both runners.
They both feel that most of the world is against them, which, I think, is not far from the truth.”
Mr. Bush often relies on the personal in his foreign policy, responding to world leaders based on his own gut sense of their trustworthiness, as he expressly and, some say, wrongly did with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

Their relationship is politically useful to both of them, as both seek, in their own ways, to shore up their legacies as leaders.
A large photograph of Mr. Bush and Mr. Olmert, walking shoulder to shoulder, hangs prominently in the West Wing of the White House.
In Mr. Olmert’s private study, there are two photos of him with Mr. Bush, one like the one in the White House and the other with Mr. Olmert’s hand on the president’s shoulder.

For Michael Oren, an Israeli historian of American-Israeli relations, “the message is very clear” that Mr. Bush is a strong supporter of Israel and of its current prime minister.
However warm, the relationship is not one of equals.
“But in the end, Bush is the leader of the free world, someone whose decisions affect the entire world.
And you see the dynamics of that in the room.”

Mr. Olmert’s effusive praise of Mr. Bush can embarrass Israelis, but they also understand that the relationship with Washington is central.
Mr. Bush, as usual, is more circumspect in his public comments.
Part of that may be personality, but part also reflects the power of Washington and the need to try to seem even-handed between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Mr. Olmert, who is said to have begun his acquaintance with Mr. Bush with a little skepticism, fed by his dovish wife, Aliza, has come to admire and trust Mr. Bush, his aides say.
They say he believes that Mr. Bush, with his post-9/11 stance against terrorism and his belief in Israel’s democratic values, is a dependable ally who understands Israel’s security problems, both with the Palestinians and regionally, with Iran, and who is committed to defending Israel’s existence.
For Mr. Olmert, the close connection to Mr. Bush is both a lifeline and an insurance policy, that Israel will not be pressed to sacrifice its security to satisfy the American desire for a peace treaty.
“I trust him, I like him, and I think he’s a man of strength,” the president said.
“He’ll make sure he knows the extracurricular interest of his interlocutor,” Mr. Levy said.
Mr. Olmert gave Mr. Bush, who has traded running for biking, an Israeli national bike-team uniform, a water canteen emblazoned with “George W. 43” and a global positioning system for the handlebars, loaded with the trails on his Texas ranch and riding paths in Israel.
When the G.P.S.
is turned on, the American and Israeli flags appear, and the sentence: “To my friend George Bush, from one athlete to another, happy trails.”

When you leave the park and head east along Route 86, you’ll pass through the Tohono O’odham Indian Reservation.
The land there is grassier, with stands of yucca plants and the deciduous desert tree called the palo verde.
Homes are spread out at a distance from the highway or clustered in Sells, the Tohono O’odham capital.
Beyond the reservation, at the town of Three Points, head south on Route 286.
A left on Arivaca Road leads to the tiny town of Arivaca.
Depending on your predilections, you can enjoy a strong cup of joe at Caffe Aribac, where the beans are roasted on site, or a beer at La Gitana Cantina, an old cowboy bar where a sign on the wall reads “Manuell Corona Killed here June, 24, 1912.
“Years back, we had a lot more fights.”
Nearby, the Arivaca Cienega Trail, located in a nature preserve, is a haven for wintering birds and their admirers.
Another adventure awaits just off the main drag.
Distant mountain ranges rise in every direction.
After a few miles, the asphalt gives way to a dirt road, bumpy and slow going but passable in most cars.
Twelve miles and about 40 minutes later you’ll reach the ghost town of Ruby.
Prospectors started pecking around these hills in the 1850s, but it wasn’t until after the Civil War that an actual settlement began to take hold.
Today, Ruby, which is about four miles from the Mexican border, is privately owned and having a second life as a quasi-tourist attraction.
Its collection of crumbling buildings, serenely set under the rocky dome of Montana Peak, can easily fill a couple of hours of exploring.
He told his new friends that he was “like a dog following the sun.” The name stuck and is now, he said, what everyone knows him by.
Sundog has worked his way from Alaska to Chile.
In these borderlands, he has hiked over many miles and into a few of the old mine shafts, and he’ll gladly share his knowledge.
“Not only is the area part of a major migration corridor,” he told me, “but it’s also the northernmost range for several Central American plant and animal species.” Ruby’s visitors, he said, span the ranks of the curious from biologists and bird watchers to “ghost town people,” travelers who keep life lists of all the ghost towns they have visited.

Back on the trail, Ruby Road will take you 22 more winding miles through vistas of oak and grassland before running directly into Interstate 19, the main artery between Tucson and Nogales.
About two miles south, you’ll find authentic Mexican food at Soto’s PK Outpost, and close by, the Hacienda Corona de Guevavi, a bed-and-breakfast, offers up a charming retreat in a restored adobe ranch house.
Just off Highway 82 lies another less traveled but very drivable dirt road.
Forest Service Road 61 (also known as Duquesne Road) follows the border for 55 stunning miles over the Patagonia Mountains, across the sweeping grasslands of the San Rafael Valley, and up to 6,575 feet atop Montezuma’s Pass in Coronado National Memorial.
As you make your way up the backside of the Huachuca Mountains, you begin to see vistas into Mexico.

“I’ve seen more wildlife on that road than anywhere else in the area, including a mountain lion, and once a pack of coatimundi,” noted Maggi Daly, a park guide at the visitors center.
“Even after three years of being here, I am still struck by the incredible beauty all around.
It’s phenomenal.”
From the parking lot at the pass, it’s a short hike up to Coronado Peak and a sweeping panorama of the Sierra Madre in Mexico.
Farther east, San Jose Peak rises from flat desert to 8,337 feet.
Up here, the rugged landscape takes on a magical, golden-hued softness; somehow, it’s easy to imagine Vasquez de Coronado leading 350 Spaniards across the valley in the 1540s.
Nearby, the mile-long Yaqui Ridge Trail descends to the border, where a rusty barbed-wire fence stretches in both directions as far as the eye can see.
For now, it’s all that separates Mexico and the United States in this remote spot.
A border marker— a tall, thin white obelisk — gleams, sentinel-like, in the hot bright sun.
This marker, No.
102, and dozens more like it were erected in the early 1890s.
The peaceful serenity of this great, grand emptiness belies the political strife that has plagued this boundary from the day it was drawn.
Overhead, a shiny black raven, free of any land-bound constraints, floats on the breeze, slowly drifting from one side to the other.
One last stretch of dirt road, about 50 miles away, is also worth a look.
Driving east out of the town of Douglas, 15th Street becomes the Geronimo Trail and wends its way past rounded hills.
Thickets of ocotillo and tall agave stalks spike the horizon.
About a quarter-mile from the turnoff on Geronimo Trail, you see the white gate that says “Slaughter”; make a right and drive through it and into the John Slaughter Ranch, established in the 1880s.
John Slaughter’s immense cattle empire encompassed pretty much all the land you see before you.
Today the collection of handsomely restored buildings, about 200 yards from the border, is part of the Johnson Historical Museum of the Southwest.
“Just out there is where Pancho Villa camped with thousands of men during the Mexican Civil War before the battle at Agua Prieta,” Bill Elliott, the resident caretaker, said, pointing beyond the barbed wire fence into Mexico.
Within easy walking distance of the homestead, past the cottonwoods and willow trees that flank a natural spring-fed pond, another old border marker awaits: No.
77.
In these parts border politics is a delicate topic, and talk of the various types of fences now being erected brings passionate exchanges.
Mr. Elliott, an affable man who hails from nearby Bisbee, takes a pragmatic view: “The government has a 50-foot easement along the border,” he said, “and they are allowed to do what they want.”
Mr. Elliott acknowledges that Border Patrol activities have some negative effect on the wildlife, and he hopes the vehicle barrier planned for the boundary along the ranch’s property won’t be too disruptive.
“We can always plant more trees and shrubs to minimize its visual impact,” he said.
Nevada, with 10,666 filings in 2007, had the highest year-over-year increase in bankruptcy filings, at 110 percent, according to court records that A.A.C.E.R.
examined.
California, the nation’s most populous state, was second with 70,638 filings, up 87 percent.

People have two main options in seeking bankruptcy protection.
They can file under Chapter 7, the so-called fresh start, which eliminates many unsecured debts like credit card charges and medical bills.
Or they can file a Chapter 13 reorganization plan, which allows them to save their homes and cars but often requires that they repay some unsecured debts.
Consumers who make more than their state’s median income must pass a means test to file for Chapter 7, a crucial new element of current bankruptcy law.
“It is rare for a household with income less than $100,000 not to pass the Chapter 7 means test,” said Henry J. Sommer, president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys.
For those who do not pass the test, their only other bankruptcy remedy is usually Chapter 13.
According to an analysis of court records by Robert M. Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, about 30 percent of those filing for bankruptcy protection throughout 2004 chose Chapter 13.
“The new law has contributed to a higher percentage of Chapter 13s, but the mortgage crisis undoubtedly plays a role,” he said.
“Distressed homeowners traditionally file Chapter 13 to save their homes.”
In Las Vegas, Judge Bruce A. Markell of United States Bankruptcy Court has seen a larger percentage of Chapter 13s lately.
But an increasing number are “placeholder” filings by consumers who have no possibility of affording their mortgages’ resetting interest rates, he said.
Unless a creditor is very diligent, a Chapter 13 filing stays a foreclosure for two or three months, Judge Markell explained: “The placeholder filing buys you time to time to maneuver, to find another location.”

But James F. Molleur, a bankruptcy lawyer in Saco, Me., said federal oversight, required under the new law, is also increasing the percentage of Chapter 13 filings, by focusing on debtors who file for Chapter 7.
“The Department of Justice’s Trustee Program, which supervises bankruptcy law,” he said, “is conducting audits and investigations, looking for above-median-income debtors who file Chapter 7s and aggressively working to push them into Chapter 13s.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Jane Limprecht, a spokeswoman for the United States Trustee Program at the Justice Department, said it had no comment on Mr. Molleur’s claim.
Legislation pending in Congress could spur still more people to choose Chapter 13 to save their homes.
For primary residences, the bills would allow bankruptcy judges to lower interest rates and reduce values to the current appraisals.
These powers are similar to those that bankruptcy judges have for other types of secured loans under Chapter 13.
“Current bankruptcy law makes it easier for debtors to keep vacation homes, investment property and yachts than it does for them to keep their residences,” said Mr. Sommer, of the bankruptcy lawyers’ association.
The financial services industry opposes the legislation.
Steve Bartlett, president and chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, an association in Washington representing the nation’s largest lenders and securities dealers, said such changes would be “a disaster for both consumers and the economy” because they would drive up rates on new mortgages for everyone else and further disrupt the global securities market.
Proponents of the 2005 bankruptcy law say it is working.
“For anybody who has real hardships and can’t repay their debts, the bankruptcy safety net remains as strong as ever,” Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who sponsored the legislation changing the bankruptcy rules as a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail message.
“The reforms to bankruptcy law have helped ensure that people who are able to repay their debts are taking responsibility for at least some of their bills,” Senator Grassley said.
Lois R. Lupica, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law, argued that there have never been many abusers in the bankruptcy system.
“What reform — and I use that word loosely — did was to make bankruptcy more expensive and cumbersome to file, and to scare people away from it.”

Professor Lawless said that with consumers’ debts higher than ever, “only the increased cost of filing bankruptcy under the new law” explains why there are fewer filings than under the old law.
The new law’s ambiguities, as well as increased liability for lawyers and demands for more paperwork on short deadlines, have pushed up legal fees considerably, he said.
“You have to pay for Chapter 7 legal fees upfront in cash,” he said.
“You can be too poor to go bankrupt.”

Judge Markell in Nevada said the normal fee for a Chapter 13 in Las Vegas is now around $4,300, up from about $2,700 before the new law.
Chapter 13 may be the only remedy for wealthy consumers whose homes are worth less than they owe or who have unmanageable unsecured debts.
“Some considering bankruptcy will be shocked to find they may not be able to get a clean slate under the new law,” said Jeffrey S. Conner, a San Francisco real estate lawyer.
Not everyone who wants a Chapter 13, which has always had debt limits, can get one.
“It’s easy to be over the caps with home prices in places like California, and people who can no longer file a Chapter 7 are neither fish nor fowl,” said David A. Tilem, a bankruptcy lawyer in Glendale, Calif. Their only bankruptcy remedy is a pricey plan under Chapter 11, which is used mostly by businesses.
But Mr. Molleur advised him to make a filing under Chapter 13, through which he will pay a total $2,000 over five years on the $100,000 delinquency and avoid tax liability on it.
“I feel like the lead balloon over my head has gone away,” Mr. Alexander said.
Mr. Molleur has a different take.
“The Trustee Program feels vindicated by having more Chapter 13s to pad their statistics,” he said, “but many unsecured creditors do not really benefit.”
Joseph Giacobbe, a mortgage specialist in Manhattan, and his wife felt the long arm of the United States Trustee Program after filing for Chapter 7 last April.
They sought relief from $69,000 in unsecured debt, including $52,000 in credit card bills, partly incurred when the couple quit their jobs to care for Ms. Giacobbe’s ailing parents.
Filing for bankruptcy has been a nightmare, Mr. Giacobbe said.
Crystal Erickson, 33, an artist and teacher in Portland, Me., is considering bankruptcy as she tries to communicate with her lender about a two-family dwelling she and her fiancé, Dobol Luak, 34, a student, bought in September 2004.
The couple managed to make payments after the first reset but could not afford them after the second one last summer.
In a Chapter 13 case, a judge can change the terms of a loan for consumers who were victims of predatory lending.
“We don’t want to move,” Ms. Erickson said.
“We’re part of this community, and from working with kids who live in public housing, I see that communities are created or destroyed depending on whether people have ownership in their homes.”
Mike Henry, 48, a maintenance technician and single father from Madisonville, Tenn., said he reluctantly filed for Chapter 7 protection last year after spending most of his savings to pay medical bills.
“I felt a little relieved, but mostly guilty because I’ve always paid my debts all my life,” Mr. Henry said.

AS emerging-market bonds have racked up strong gains and become more expensive in recent years, fund managers seeking new opportunities have often turned to such debt that is denominated in local currencies.
Traditionally, emerging-market bond funds have invested primarily in government-issued, emerging-market bonds issued in dollars and euros.
But, as the economies of emerging markets have strengthened because of strong commodities markets and fiscal and monetary reforms, governments in countries like Brazil, Mexico and Russia have been buying back such bonds and issuing bonds denominated in reals, pesos and rubles.
“Most countries are issuing less debt in dollars,” said Mike Conelius, manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond fund, which has $666 million in assets.
“It’s a sign of better credit conditions, but it means dollar-denominated debt is somewhat more expensive than local-currency debt.
Mr. Conelius noted that 10-year local currency notes issued by Brazil, for example, yield about 13 percent, or almost nine percentage points over comparable United States Treasuries, while the same credit issued in dollars is yielding less than two percentage points over Treasuries.
The difference is attributable primarily to the currency risk, he said.
“As an investor, I’m interested in finding the cheapest way to invest in these markets,” Mr. Conelius said.
“In many cases, that means buying local-market debt.”

Today, 25 percent of the T. Rowe Price fund is invested in local-currency debt.
However, Mr. Conelius has hedged 60 percent of that position into dollars, reducing the fund’s currency exposure.
The fund returned 5.8 percent in 2007, putting it in the top 24 percent of emerging-market bond funds.
While emerging-market bond funds over all returned 6.6 percent in 2007, the Pimco Developing Local Markets and Pimco Emerging Local Bond funds, which invest solely in local-currency debt, were the top-performing emerging-market debt funds, with returns of 13.2 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively.
The holdings of Developing Local Markets have an average maturity of less than one year, compared with seven years for the Emerging Local Bond fund.
Developing Local Markets, with $4.4 billion in assets, is the largest emerging-market bond fund tracked by Morningstar.
Local-currency emerging-market bonds returned, on average, 5.5 percent in 2007, when returns were not converted into dollars, according to data from JPMorgan.

Over time, as these markets mature, he said, local interest rates are likely to decline, providing good potential for capital appreciation.
Investing in these bonds can also stabilize returns, he said.
“With 40 to 50 investable countries, each with different economic conditions,” he said, “you really get good diversification benefits.”
But some fund managers caution that because of the risk of recession in the United States, this is the time to become more conservative.
But in December, he brought that exposure down to 10 percent, saying that it was time to reduce risk, although he is bullish over the long term.
“Layering local debt into emerging market bond funds provides money managers with real opportunities to add value without subjecting investors to too much volatility,” he said.
“It really is about expanding investment opportunities.”
His fund, which has $403 million in assets, returned 5.7 percent in 2007, better than 65 percent of its peers.
John Carlson, manager of the Fidelity New Markets Income fund, which has $2.1 billion in assets, is similarly cautious for now but optimistic over the long term.
The fund has 2 percent of its assets allocated to local-currency bonds, down from 5 percent in October.
“We’ve had a tremendous run in the currencies,” Mr. Carlson said.
“I’m taking some chips off the table.” Still, he said, “over the long term, local currency will become a larger and more stable part of the portfolio as the markets evolve.” Money managers generally caution individuals to keep emerging-market debt to no more than 10 percent of their fixed-income portfolios.
“At that level, you get the diversification benefits of the asset class without subjecting your portfolio to getting swamped in a down swell,” said Lawrence Jones, a Morningstar mutual fund analyst.
And the use of an exoskeleton could be quite fruitful.”
A brain machine interface is any system that allows people or animals to use their brain activity to control an external device.
But until ways are found to safely implant electrodes into human brains, most research will remain focused on animals.
In preparing for the experiment, Idoya was trained to walk upright on a treadmill.
And some fired in anticipation of her movements.
The video and brain cell activity were then combined and translated into a format that a computer could read.
This format is able to predict with 90 percent accuracy all permutations of Idoya’s leg movements three to four seconds before the movement takes place.
The robot, called CB for Computational Brain, has the same range of motion as a human.
It can dance, squat, point and “feel” the ground with sensors embedded in its feet, and it will not fall over when shoved.

Designed by the Sarcos Research Corporation in Salt Lake City, the robot was chosen for the experiment because of its extraordinary ability to mimic human locomotion.
She could see the back of CB’s legs on an enormous movie screen in front of her treadmill and received treats if she could make the robot’s joints move in synchrony with her own leg movements.

What would Idoya do?

Vision is a powerful, dominant signal in the brain, Dr. Nicolelis said.
In the near future, Idoya and other bipedal monkeys will be getting more feedback from CB in the form of microstimulation to neurons that specialize in the sense of touch related to the legs and feet.
When CB’s feet touch the ground, sensors will detect pressure and calculate balance.
When that information goes directly into the monkeys’ brains, Dr. Nicolelis said, they will have the strong impression that they can feel CB’s feet hitting the ground.
At that point, the monkeys will be asked to make CB walk across a room by using just their thoughts.
“We have shown that you can take signals across the planet in the same time scale that a biological system works,” Dr. Nicolelis said.
“Here the target happens to be a robot.
It could be a crane.
Or any tool of any size or magnitude.
The body does not have a monopoly for enacting the desires of the brain.”
To prove this point, Dr. Nicolelis and his colleague, Dr. Manoel Jacobsen Teixeira, a neurosurgeon at the Sirio-Lebanese Hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, plan to demonstrate by the end of the year that humans can operate an exoskeleton with their thoughts.
It is not uncommon for people to have their arms ripped from their shoulder sockets during a motorcycle or automobile accident, Dr. Nicolelis said.
All the nerves are torn, leaving the arm paralyzed but in chronic pain.
Dr. Teixeira is implanting electrodes on the surface of these patients’ brains and stimulating the underlying region where the arm is represented.
The pain goes away.
By pushing the same electrodes slightly deeper in the brain, Dr. Nicolelis said, it should be possible to record brain activity involved in moving the arm and intending to move the arm.
The patients’ paralyzed arms will then be placed into an exoskeleton or shell equipped with motors and sensors.
“They should be able to move the arm with their thoughts,” he said.
“This is science fiction coming to life.”
By 1992, as a matter of fact, the economy was already growing again.

The main problem now is that the good times are no longer good enough to carry the middle class through the bad times.
For much of the last 35 years, the incomes of most workers have been growing far more slowly than they once did.
In the current expansion, which started in 2001, the median weekly paycheck of workers has actually fallen 1 percent, once inflation is taken into account, according to the Labor Department.
Economists argue about the reasons for the great wage slowdown — technology, globalization, health care costs, the decline of unions, the rise of the new wealthy — but it clearly seems to have made people feel more vulnerable to small economic swings.
This glumness is especially striking because perceptions of the economy usually lag behind reality, and the reality hasn’t deteriorated much yet for most families.
But as in 1992, said Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, “people are more sour about the economy than the data would seem to warrant.”
Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Republican from Utah on the Joint Economic Committee, put it this way to me: “There is a growing disconnect between the way the economy is operating and the way people feel about it.
And it stems from individual families’ sense of economic anxiety.”
The most important difference between 1992 and today — if not the most obvious one — is the source of that anxiety.
Companies weren’t investing enough in new equipment, and productivity — the amount an average worker turns out in an hour — had been growing slowly since the 1970s.

In some ways, the good times have continued under the current President Bush.
For the last six years, the economy has been growing at a pretty healthy clip.
The problem now isn’t the level of growth but how little of it is filtering down to the middle class.
In today’s economy, middle-class incomes have almost no margin for error.
Unless there is a true boom, incomes don’t grow much.
And the economy has slowed enough this decade to tip the balance and to leave people worrying that worse is yet to come.
“In 2008, there is a greater fear of falling.”

The solution will probably need to involve some combination of education, health care and tax changes.
Keep in mind that middle-class families have received not only modest raises in recent years; they have also received smaller reductions in their overall federal tax rates than high-income families have.
That’s a tough combination.
For now, the campaign debate has shifted toward short-term questions like how to design a good stimulus package.
Unfortunately, no stimulus package will solve the larger issues.
The threat of recession “is a terrible distraction to everyone,” as Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Senator John McCain’s economic adviser, said, because it moves the debate away from globalization, energy policy and climate change, and onto smaller topics like one-time tax rebates.
Yet I think the big questions may still end up dominating the debate.
By this summer, and certainly by Jan. 20, 2009, the stimulus package will be old news, one way or the other.
“The main problem is not short-term,” Mr. Blinder, the former Fed vice chairman, said.
“But short-term problems have a way of grabbing people’s attention.”
The president’s tax cuts, which lowered rates for individuals and investors, are set to expire at the end of 2010.
Mr. Bush has said repeatedly that he will devote his last year in office to making them permanent, a vow he reiterated in a speech in Chicago before leaving for the Middle East.

“In a time of economic uncertainty,” the president said, “we ought to be sending a clear signal that taxes will remain low.”
Vice President Dick Cheney has also been a strong supporter of the tax cuts, although it is not clear what role he is playing in the current debate.
The debate casts a fresh spotlight on the White House economic team, a little-known collection of forecasters, strategists and business executives who have struggled for influence inside an administration that has long been preoccupied with terrorism and the war in Iraq.

It is a team that has often been in flux.
Mr. Bush is on his third treasury secretary, Mr. Paulson, who was wooed away from his job as chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs by Mr. Bolten, himself a former executive there.
Mr. Bush has had four National Economic Council directors; Mr. Hennessey replaced Allan B. Hubbard, an Indianapolis businessman who has known Mr. Bush since their days at Harvard Business School together.
And there have been five chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers, a group now headed by Edward P. Lazear, who is on leave from his job as a Stanford University business professor.
“We’re not doing this just to play games here,” he said.
“So we obviously want to propose something that we feel would do the American economy some good, and that means it has to be enacted.”

Within the current economic team, Mr. Paulson clearly wields the most clout.
With his Wall Street credentials, he has Mr. Bush’s ear, as well as that of some leading Congressional Democrats, including Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York.
Kenneth M. Duberstein, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. Paulson, calls him “first among equals.”
Mr. Schumer said that he has told Mr. Paulson it would “cause real problems” for the White House to insist that a stimulus package be linked to permanent tax cuts.
One Republican close to the White House said he believed Mr. Paulson and the other pragmatists would ultimately persuade the administration that it would be worth making some concessions to get a rescue package through Congress.

“They’re not going to start off signaling that they’re going to be flexible, but Paulson and Bolten and Gillespie know that this is going to be a negotiation,” said this Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity.
“Their view is a stimulus is essential and their No.
1 priority, and therefore everything else has to be negotiable to achieve the priority.
It’s a huge shift.”
Mr. Paulson came into the administration viewed as someone who could bridge the divide with Democrats, yet he has had some difficulty doing so.
As a whole, the economics team has also drawn criticism for overly optimistic economic predictions.
“We still have not heard from the president as to what he wants to do on this,” Mr. Lazear said Tuesday.
“He’s been focused on the Middle East.”
Mr. Bernanke asked a good question: “Why is the United States, with the world’s largest economy, borrowing heavily on international capital markets — rather than lending, as would seem more natural?”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
His answer was that the main explanation lay not here in America, but abroad.
In particular, third world economies, which had been investor favorites for much of the 1990s, were shaken by a series of financial crises beginning in 1997.
As a result, they abruptly switched from being destinations for capital to sources of capital, as their governments began accumulating huge precautionary hoards of overseas assets.
Why?
Because, said Mr. Bernanke, of the “depth and sophistication of the country’s financial markets.”
All of this was right, except for one thing: U.S. financial markets, it turns out, were characterized less by sophistication than by sophistry, which my dictionary defines as “a deliberately invalid argument displaying ingenuity in reasoning in the hope of deceiving someone.” E.g., “Repackaging dubious loans into collateralized debt obligations creates a lot of perfectly safe, AAA assets that will never go bad.”
In other words, the United States was not, in fact, uniquely well-suited to make use of the world’s surplus funds.
Directly or indirectly, capital flowing into America from global investors ended up financing a housing-and-credit bubble that has now burst, with painful consequences.

The saving grace of America’s situation is that our foreign debts are in our own currency.
But even without those currency effects, the next year or two could be quite unpleasant.
What should have been done differently?
Some critics say that the Fed helped inflate the housing bubble with low interest rates.
The real sin, both of the Fed and of the Bush administration, was the failure to exercise adult supervision over markets running wild.
The fact is that as America’s financial system has grown ever more complex, it has also outgrown the framework of banking regulations that used to protect us — yet instead of an attempt to update that framework, all we got were paeans to the wonders of free markets.
Right now, Mr. Bernanke is in crisis-management mode, trying to deal with the mess his predecessor left behind.
I don’t have any problems with his testimony yesterday, although I suspect that it’s already too late to prevent a recession.

But let’s hope that when the dust settles a bit, Mr. Bernanke takes the lead in talking about what needs to be done to fix a financial system gone very, very wrong.

The Nasdaq composite index declined 6.88 points Friday, to 2,340.02, and is down 11.77 percent so far in 2008.
Amid steep drops in the housing market, huge losses at Wall Street banks, rising energy prices and growing fears about a recession, this year is shaping up to be a tough one for the faint-of-heart.
“The R-word is really scaring investors,” said Leon Rousso, a certified financial planner in Ventura, Calif. “I’ve been holding hands and comforting people to get through this and not to panic.”
Yet some analysts warn the news could get much uglier.
Earnings forecasts “have gone down quite dramatically” this year, said Michael Thompson, a managing director at Thomson Proprietary Research.

Analysts, already bracing for a wave of weak fourth-quarter earnings, have doubled their loss estimates since the year began.
They now expect S.& P. 500 companies to report a 20 percent drop in earnings for the final three months of 2007, down from estimates of a 10 percent decline just three weeks ago.
Earnings forecasts for the first quarter of this year are being scaled back, too.
Forecasts have been driven down by the poor performance of financial companies, which typically generate 25 percent of overall earnings growth in the S.& P. 500.
Analysts now expect them to contribute 1 percent.
“All you’re getting is baggage with these guys,” Mr. Thompson said.
And some worry the financial sector remains at risk for further losses.

“What could cause greater economic losses or fallout in the market would be further recognized losses or downgrades in the financial sector,” said Joe Davis, an economist at the mutual fund company Vanguard Group.
“That is the heart of the problem and where the greatest risks lie.”
Indeed, while many of the world’s largest financial institutions, including Citigroup, Mejrrill Lynch and UBS, have written down billions of dollars worth of securities linked to mortgages in recent weeks, some investors remain concerned that losses could grow if default levels continue to climb not only on mortgages, but also on credit card bills and auto loans.

Making matters worse, there is mounting concern about the ability of companies that sell insurance for bonds, including MBIA and Ambac, to survive.
That move could have a major ripple effect on Wall Street because many banks and investors buy insurance from these companies to protect themselves from losses.
“Eventually, there is the possibility that there are so many defaults that these companies will not be able to meet the interest payments,” said Rob Haines, a senior insurance analyst with the research firm CreditSights.

Still, some investors are hanging their hopes for a rebound in the market on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut interest rates again by the end of the month.
Some also hope that Washington can quickly cobble together a fiscal stimulus package that would give the economy a boost.
On Friday, President Bush called for $145 billion in tax rebates for American families and incentives for businesses to keep the economy from sliding into recession.
“I believe there is a bipartisan belief that fiscal stimulus is needed.
We just don’t know what form Congress will eventually pass,” Ms. Cohen said.

For her part, Ms. Cohen believes her call for the Dow to end 2008 at 14,750 will stand because much of the bad economic news will come out in the next few months.
“But economic growth will be looking better by the end of ’08 and into 2009,” she added.
Others clearly share that view.
While the market has tumbled, some investors have looked at the pullback as an opportunity to increase their holdings.
Vanguard, for instance, said it has had net inflows into its equity mutual funds so far this year.
“I definitely tell some of my more aggressive clients that this is absolutely the time to buy,” Mr. Rousso said.
“I don’t tell all of my clients that — especially the older ones — but the younger ones should absolutely look at the market.”
Likewise, Ms. Cohen said she has taken calls in recent days from pension funds, endowments and other investors with long-term investment strategies that are “looking at interesting opportunities that are developing,” she said.
Interest is also rising in the United States stock market by foreign investors and corporations whose strong currencies make American investments even cheaper, she said.
Moves by Congress and the Federal Reserve over the next few weeks could very well determine whether the economy slides into a full-blown recession and the markets continue to be pummeled by bad news, said Mr. Davis of Vanguard.
“There are a lot of wild cards out there right now, including rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and what a tax stimulus package could look like,” Mr. Davis said.
“I do not think it is too late to prevent a recession, but we are at a critical juncture.”
Many observers, including Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, as well as a group of bearish stock traders, say the United States may already be sinking into a recession.
The White House has started talking about proposing relief.
And just recently, Bernanke sent the clearest signal yet that the 17-member Federal Open Market Committee (which governs the Fed’s interest-rate policy, and over which Bernanke presides) would cut interest rates when it meets at the end of the month.
In a speech, Bernanke warned that “the downside risks to growth have become more pronounced,” a gloomier assessment of the economy than he had given previously.

Bernanke also has strong reasons to worry, however, about easing rates too much.
Inflation has failed to fall as the Fed expected.
(In fact, lately it has been rising.)
Also, lower interest rates induce foreigners to switch out of dollar-denominated investments like Treasuries and into currencies with higher yields.
Thus, any rate cut would tend to escalate the stampede out of the dollar.
Bernanke is aware that he holds the same potential for influence as Burns — which is to say he has a profound ability to affect the political landscape this year.
Polls show that the economy is now the most important issue to voters in the presidential election (more important even than the war).
A recession would seem to be a clear repudiation of President Bush’s policies and, by extension, the Republican Party.
Those who know Bernanke, however, say he is not motivated by politics.
“He wants to be known as a great central banker,” says Mark Gertler, his close friend and an economics professor at New York University.
“Those with the worst reputations are the ones who helped politicians.”
A wage-and-price spiral similar to that in the 1970s would not only be a political nightmare for the Republicans, it would also be a crushing blow to Bernanke’s reputation as a Fed chief.
And with oil and food prices going through the roof, inflation is already a worry.
The consumer price index surged 4.3 percent over the past 12 months — more than twice the inflation rate that Bernanke has delineated as the upper bound of his comfort range.
(The widely watched “core” rate of inflation, which does not include volatile food or energy prices, is not as high as the overall rate, but it, too, has edged higher than Bernanke would like.)
“I think Bernanke is in a very difficult situation,” Paul Volcker told me.
“Too many bubbles have been going on for too long,” Volcker added.
“The Fed is not really in control of the situation.”
This past fall, as markets and sometimes the world seemed to be tumbling all around Bernanke, I met him in his office for a mostly off-the-record chat.
We sat at a coffee table from which I could make out a Bloomberg terminal at his desk, some framed bills from the first series of Federal Reserve notes, his certificate of nomination by President Bush and shelves of economics books.
Bernanke has a serious manner, befitting a scholar who once expected to spend his entire career in academia.
However, I have the advantage of having a terrific committee” — the Federal Open Market Committee — “and strong staff support, and I think we have a good hold and understanding of the situation.”

Behind the modesty and blandness of such remarks, Bernanke is uncommonly thoughtful and also resilient.
With more than a million households facing the possibility of home foreclosure in the next year, he will need all of his resourcefulness and more.
“Every central-bank governor goes through tests of some sort,” says Stanley Fischer, the governor of the Bank of Israel and the man who was Bernanke’s thesis adviser at M.I.T.
“Usually, the gods oblige by providing a test early on.” Bernanke’s exam looks like a doozy.
The Fed is facing two distinct threats — an apparent slowing of the economy over the intermediate term and a short-term market panic that has caused lenders (both banks and investors) to tighten credit lines, putting a squeeze on banks and other institutions that rely on short-term borrowing.
To ease the immediate crisis, the Fed has made credit more available through the so-called “discount window,” where it lends to private banks.
Among other things, the Federal Reserve Bank is a bank — actually a group of banks with branches around the country.
Lending at the discount window is one way that the Fed fulfills its unstated mission, which is to be the banker of last resort in times of crisis.
The Fed also has two formal missions that are codified in law: to promote “maximum employment” (thus its duty to head off recessions) and, of course, to maintain a stable purchasing power, which is generally interpreted as keeping the inflation rate at a tolerable level.
There is a general notion that the Fed has vast powers over the economy itself.
This is an impression enhanced by Greenspan’s Delphic pronouncements (anyone so inscrutable must have been pulling all the strings, or so it was tempting to believe).
As Bernanke notes, the public has high expectations for what the Fed can do.
Actually, it has very little influence over most of what makes the economy tick, like improvements in productivity, educational levels or whether commodity prices are trending higher or lower and so forth.
The Fed’s principal power is its control over the supply of money.
You can think of the Fed as the banker in a national game of Monopoly.
Normally, everyone gets $200 when they pass “Go,” but when business conditions slump, the Fed can give the economy a boost — much like hiking the “Go” rate to $300.
Or, if the prices of the little green houses and red hotels are rising too swiftly, it can hand out less money.
Of course, the Fed doesn’t really hand out money.
Its principal monetary lever is something called the federal funds rate, which is the rate that private banks charge one another for overnight loans.
The Federal Open Market Committee cannot “set” the fed funds rate by fiat; when it wants to, say, lower the rate, which as of this writing was 4.25 percent, it directs the New York Fed to inject cash into the system.
The New York Fed lends money to major dealers in government securities, taking Treasuries as collateral.
(Conversely, to tighten rates, the New York Fed borrows money.)
This power to expand the money supply is unique.
If one bank purchases bills from another, there is no net change in the banking system’s liquidity.
Only the central banker, the Fed, can create new money.
The fed funds rate does not directly affect rates on car loans or leveraged buyouts or anything else.
But when the fed funds rate eases, it’s an indication that the Fed has added liquidity to the system.
Since the only thing banks can do with liquidity is lend it out, a flush banking system will act like a healthy heart, pumping credit into the economy.

During the Volcker era, the Fed conducted policy by adding or subtracting money until the total of bank reserves and checking accounts (what is commonly referred to as the “money supply”) reached a desired level.
But with innovations in the financial system, like brokerage checking accounts, the lines between “money” and other financial assets blurred, and counting the money supply became too difficult.
Now it simply monitors the interest rate.
If it wants to ease the rate, for instance, it keeps adding liquidity until banks react by reducing overnight rates to the target level.
In an illustration of how one bubble seems to beget another, however, the Greenspan rate cut greatly stimulated the housing industry.
In particular, since adjustable-rate mortgages are determined by short-term interest rates, low rates paved the way for the explosion in ARMs, the very mortgages that lately have been defaulting at an epidemic pace.
As demand for mortgages swelled, banks began to engage in highly dubious lending practices, including issuing mortgages without verifying the income of borrowers.
The Fed, which apart from its monetary role is also one of the federal agencies that regulates banks, was warned that standards were slipping.
Thus, in both of its main areas of responsibility — monetary and regulatory policy — Fed laxity has seemingly contributed to the current mess.
Bernanke deflects such criticisms, partly because he maintains that the mortgage fiasco had many fathers and partly because he has a scholar’s disdain for perfect-hindsight-type judgments.
Bernanke has also shown his academic bent in how he runs the Fed.
He has democratized interest-rate policy by giving the members of the Open Market Committee more of a voice.
But as the point man for the U.S. economy in a time of crisis, perhaps the Fed chief should be more commanding, suggests Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman and a former Princeton colleague.

The shadow of the czarlike Greenspan lingers over Bernanke, and as Greenspan has been promoting his memoirs and has otherwise been keeping visible, it is unlikely to go away.
Somewhat embarrassingly, he has suffered dissents on both ends of the spectrum.
Under Bernanke, the various Open Market Committee members have felt freer to speak their minds, and they have done so.
This free speech has sometimes sounded cacophonous; the president of the Philadelphia Fed has clamored for a more hawkish policy, the Boston Fed for a dovish one.
(In Fed parlance, hawks want to tighten rates; doves favor easing them.)
Not surprisingly, Wall Street has found this dissonance confusing.
Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, insists that several times in recent months the market hasn’t heard what the Fed is saying.
One of Bernanke’s Open Market Committee colleagues admits that he worries about the extent to which “democracy,” however admirable, has dulled the Fed’s aura and, perhaps, its ability to lead.
On the other hand, Bernanke has held the group together (committee members respect him enormously), and the wide diversity of their opinions points to Bernanke’s greatest strength, which is teasing out a consensus.
“He is very good at hearing what everyone else has to say — of summarizing the discussion and then making his own observations,” says Charles Plosser, the president of the Philadelphia Fed and a hawk on the committee.
“Does he persuade?
He listens very carefully.
He summarizes.
Then he tries to shape what we should do.”

The Federal Open Market Committee is an unwieldy and archaic body in the best of times; it includes seven Fed governors in Washington (at the moment there are only five) and the presidents of the Fed’s 12 regional banks, which are dispersed in cities like Richmond and Cleveland, in the country’s industrial centers circa 1913, when the Fed was founded.
This hydralike form is a result of the country’s abiding fear of concentrated financial power.
Congress twice set up central banks in the early years of the republic but let their charters lapse.
In its early decades, the Fed had the ability to provide an elastic currency, but was unwilling to use its power to add liquidity except to support an influx of gold, or to finance so-called “real bills” — meaning paper backed by industrial and agricultural goods.
The head of the Philadelphia Fed lamented, in the midst of the Depression, “If we were to expand now we would be putting out credit when people don’t need it.” He was warning against the very tonic — a little extra liquidity — that might have allowed businesses to start investing money and hiring workers.
That view is now widely accepted, and Bernanke’s scholarship added a dimension by emphasizing the pivotal role of banking panics in aggravating the monetary failure.
For Bernanke, the Depression was the unique laboratory for learning his craft.
As he is fond of saying, “If you want to learn about seismic activity, you study earthquakes, not tremors.”
Bernanke updates Bush and Vice President Cheney several times a year, but he prizes his political independence.
Unlike Greenspan, he has avoided taking positions on economic issues that do not relate to the Fed’s mission.
(An exception is his affirmation that he “believes in the laws of arithmetic,” a none-too-subtle rejection of the Bush ideology that championed deficit-spawning tax cuts.)

Tension with the White House was long part of the Fed chief’s job description, largely because the bank’s dual mandate (fighting inflation and promoting growth) was seen to be in conflict with itself.
No president wants inflation, but most want high interest rates even less.
Nixon, the incumbent vice president and Republican presidential nominee that year, blamed Martin for sabotaging his chances in November.
One version of what occurred, according to Richard Fisher, the current head of the Dallas Fed, who has studied the history, is that “Lyndon took Martin to his ranch and asked the Secret Service to leave the room.
And that’s what Burns did.
“It’s no fun raising interest rates,” Volcker admitted.
In September 1980, with Carter and Ronald Reagan in a close race, Volcker administered the coup de grâce by hiking the discount rate.

It was an object lesson on the dangers of creating too much liquidity.
Printing money (or as Friedman famously quipped, dropping bundles of bills from a helicopter) would spur the economy only temporarily.
At first, as the money supply expanded, businesses would hire more workers and produce more goods.
The economy would be “tricked” into operating at a higher gear.
But after a while, workers would insist on wage hikes, and companies would jack up prices.
The higher prices would cool off the economy again.
So the net result of printing money would be just inflation — no gains in production.
In the long term, neither the Fed nor anyone could spur an economy to grow faster than its “natural rate” — which is determined by all those other factors: productivity, population changes, technological advances, demand for exports and so forth.
Thus the dictum that inflation would lead to jobs was out.
According to the new thinking, low inflation is consistent with, and even a prerequisite for, reaching whatever the economy’s potential is.
That means that Fed chiefs and presidents are on the same side.
Only in the very short term — say, when a stimulus is needed — are the Fed’s two mandates in conflict.
Of course, since elections are decided in the short term, the potential for political infighting remains.
(The Fed is a creature of the Congress, and Bernanke must take care not to alienate it.)
This is the sort of thing they don’t train you for at M.I.T.
Judaism is important to Bernanke, though, as with other personal subjects, he does not discuss it.
His academic research was steeped in the increasingly sophisticated discipline of econometrics, which uses computer models to simulate (and predict) the economy.
The difference is partly generational, but Bernanke is clearly more comfortable working with mathematical formulas than with anecdotal examples.
The Princeton economics faculty is roughly as cohesive as the various ethnicities of the former Yugoslavia, with the principal cleft being between the “empiricists” and the “theoreticians.” Department meetings were so contentious that two professors stopped speaking to each other.
Bernanke is exceptionally methodical; he once told Alan Blinder, his Princeton colleague, that you can learn a lot about people by noting when they fish their car keys from their pocket; Bernanke does so as he leaves the office, long before he reaches his car.
He is also determined.
He and Alan B. Krueger, another colleague, were once waiting in Newark airport for a flight to Boston.
Krueger suggested renting a car.
Bernanke maintains that if the Fed is clear about its policies, the public will tailor its behavior accordingly.
For instance, if the Fed can demonstrate that it has the fortitude to snuff out inflation, individual businesses will be less likely to worry that their costs will rise, and thus less apt to raise their prices.
Following this logic, Bernanke and two colleagues proposed that the Fed become more transparent and publicize an explicit inflation target.
Frank, who had been working with Bernanke for two years, said, “What’s Bush doing appointing a Democrat?” Bernanke said, “Actually, I’m a Republican.” Bernanke rarely discusses his politics, and he tends to look at issues through a nonideological lens.
Being a Fed governor was a low-profile job, especially with Greenspan making all the decisions.
Though consumer prices were rising, Bernanke feared a possible bout of deflation — the potentially devastating phenomenon in which prices drop, leading to lessened business activity and then still lower prices and so forth.
(To what extent he influenced Greenspan is hard to determine.)
Both men were proponents of the risk-management approach to central banking, which argues in favor of taking out “insurance” to minimize even small risks — in this case, the risk of deflation.
It’s possible that it would have occurred had rates not been kept low, but in any case, Bernanke must be regarded as one of the intellectual authors of the low-rate policy that fed the housing bubble.

Bernanke is also firmly opposed to the notion that central banks should raise rates to prick bubbles in the stock market or elsewhere.
In a paper written at the height of the dot-com mania, in late 1999, Bernanke and his friend Gertler argued that it is virtually impossible to identify a bubble before it pops.
Many Wall Streeters dismiss this out of hand.
Robert Barbera, the chief economist at ITG, remarked of 1999, “A child of 4 had to know it was a bubble.” Regardless, Bernanke maintains, the interest rate is too blunt a tool for addressing a narrow sector of the economy like tech stocks or even housing.
This view remains highly controversial.
Asset bubbles are bound to burst, and various foreign central bankers argue that when they do, the economy suffers and people lose jobs.
Ignoring them is hardly without risk.

When Bernanke was nominated to be the Fed chief, a meltdown was not on many people’s radar.
The Fed now reports more frequently, and also more exhaustively, on the economy.
But he learned that “transparency” is a double-edged virtue.
Since then, the chief has spoken with more care, even among his friends.
Bernanke has discovered that even standard communication with the public — not just off-the-cuff remarks — can be fraught with peril.
In recent years, a highly watched futures contract has developed that enables investors to bet on the outcomes of Open Market Committee meetings rather like Las Vegas bookmakers laying odds on the Super Bowl.
The result is a weird hall of mirrors.
Investors scrutinize the every utterance of Fed officials and vote with their dollars, whereupon the committee must either fulfill investors’ expectations or risk a market crash.
Though the committee members that I talked to (half of the current group) denied that they feel obligated to ratify the fed funds futures, none dispute that it is a factor.
“There is excessive emphasis on reading the entrails of the Federal Reserve,” grumbles Fisher, the Dallas Fed chief.
“We get put on a table and sliced open.”
The Open Market Committee has eight regularly scheduled meetings a year.
The week before the members gather, they are sent the “green book,” with the staff’s economic outlook, and also the “blue book,” with a menu of policy options.
The other governors, whose offices are down the hallway from Bernanke’s, typically know which way the chairman will be leaning.
But the bank presidents, who generally do not confer between meetings, often arrive in Washington with no firm idea of what Bernanke wants.
The group assembles around a massive, 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table in the conference room, which adjoins the chairman’s office, and at 8:30 a.m. the room falls silent, a side door opens and Bernanke enters.
After briefings from the staff, the members go around the table as if it were a Princeton seminar, each expounding on his or her view of the economy (transcripts of Bernanke meetings are running much longer than those under Greenspan).
The bank presidents give an idea of conditions around the country, and the governors tend to coalesce around Bernanke’s view.
In Greenspan’s era, the chairman led off by giving a lengthy disquisition of his outlook and policy recommendations.
In a profound switch, Bernanke now presents his views last.
The committee also consults academic formulas that derive the theoretically “correct” fed funds rate according to the level of inflation and other economic indicators.
The most famous of these formulas, known as the Taylor Rule, correctly predicts the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee about 85 percent of the time.
Bernanke disputes the idea that he could be replaced by a computer, but to some extent, the success of modern economics has downsized his job.
The housing meltdown has defied the forecasting abilities of the Fed’s 220 crack economists, computers and all.
As late as May, Bernanke gave a speech in which he opined that “the effect of the troubles in the subprime sector on the broader housing market will likely be limited.”
It has proved to be anything but.
The country’s banks have admitted to mortgage-related losses of almost $100 billion, and the full extent of the damage, as homeowners continue to default, is not known.
He could cut interest rates and risk inflation and a run on the dollar and, at the same time, be seen as bailing out people and institutions who made bad bets on subprime mortgages.
Or he could do nothing and run the risk that the troubles in housing would leach into the general economy, causing people to lose jobs and possibly a recession.
No decision could be made in isolation, since every move would be reflected in that hall of mirrors.
And it would take time to see the effect of each decision because, as Bernanke never tires of pointing out, monetary policy works with a lag.
The Open Market Committee can never know until well after the fact — until, say, a recession occurs — whether it has made the wrong move.

The committee voted to hold rates firm.
Markets, well-versed in Fed-speak, would interpret that to mean that a rate cut might be in the offing later.
By day’s end, Countrywide Financial, a leading purveyor of cheap loans during America’s mortgage boom, would announce that “unprecedented disruptions” in markets could jeopardize its financial condition.
Banks were paying as much as 6 percent for overnight money — far more than the official Fed rate of 5.25 percent.
Bernanke has no ego about such matters, and he consulted extensively with Timothy Geithner, the president of the New York Fed, as well as with Kevin Warsh, a fast-rising 37-year-old Fed governor and former investment banker at Morgan Stanley, whose unofficial role is to keep tabs on Wall Street.
He had also forged a close relationship with Donald Kohn, his vice chairman, who has been with the Fed for 32 years and has a deep understanding of the institution and its abilities.
This unofficial war cabinet deliberated in a series of urgent telephone conversations about how to respond.
Meanwhile, some of the governors, as well as William Dudley, a former Goldman Sachs economist and now the markets chief of the New York Fed, were canvassing C.E.O.’s, bank executives, traders and the like.
A source he described as a “hedge-fund billionaire” told him that credit assets weren’t trading; people didn’t want them at any price.
“Markets weren’t functioning,” he says.
“That is very dangerous for a central banker to hear.”
Bernanke, a fan of brainstorming sessions, began to raise alternatives with his more market-savvy colleagues.
The central bankers were still looking for a golden mean — a way to arrest the particularized distress of banks without overheating the economy in general.
More disquietingly, although the fed funds rate was a half-point lower, various other interest rates — the ones that people and institutions actually borrow at — hadn’t moved by as much.
Clearly, the subprime crisis could no longer be regarded as a little problem of Wall Street or even of the housing industry.
Securities backed by subprime mortgages plummeted, but securities backed by other, more stable assets also weakened.
When specific problems breed generalized selling, central bankers get nervous.
Americans were still buying cars; factories were churning out goods.
The news solidified the feeling of the committee hawks that they should hold rates firm.
But Bernanke — ever the believer in tailoring policy to conditions as they are forecast, and not just as they are — figured that the economy was bound to weaken.
Minutes of the meeting would describe it as a “close call,” suggesting a significant amount of internal disagreement.
Still, Jim Cramer, the high-voltage CNBC stock tout, gloated, “The Fed has got your back,” implying gleefully that the Fed would protect investors at all costs.
The Fed’s dance with the futures market is a pressure-packed aspect for Bernanke, who knows that investors stake millions of dollars every day on what the chairman will do, and also react to it with the shortest-term horizon imaginable.
But Bernanke cannot ignore the futures market, as tempting as that might be.
He was reared on the academic theory of “rational expectations,” which posits that for monetary policy to work, the market and the Fed must each have a clear idea of where the other is going.
Investors have to watch the Fed, but the Fed also has to take the pulse of investors.
Bernanke and Kohn, the Fed’s vice chairman, gave speeches late in the month, indicating that they, too, were adjusting their economic outlook downward, because of repeated signs that bank credit was tightening.
Paul McCulley, a managing director at Pimco, a big bond-trading firm, accused the Fed of “breaking a covenant.” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Economy.com, complained that the Open Market Committee’s press release, a waffling statement citing the “uncertainty surrounding the outlook,” read as if it were the product of a committee.
Committee members dispute the notion that Bernanke doesn’t lead, though it’s assuredly more of a group endeavor than it was in the past.
with a leader.
It’s not that I dictate the answer, but I have to be comfortable with the outcome of the process, and as chairman I aim to shape a process that produces the best outcome.”
What about the charge that the Fed is simply bailing out Wall Street?
Bernanke invariably insists that the Fed is not concerned with investors per se.
However, as he noted in August when central bankers gathered in Jackson Hole, Wyo., “developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets.”
When Wall Street shudders, the Fed pays attention — but only, various Fed governors argued to me, because Wall Street’s angst is a symptom of real or potential economic problems: in this case, a credit crunch and an economic slowdown.
But history will no doubt judge him on how effectively he deals with this housing meltdown.
There is plenty of room to quibble with the Open Market Committee’s various decisions, but viewed from a distance, the individual moves and even the directional shifts seem less important.
By cutting rates by a total of one point since August, Bernanke has clearly moved toward a policy of stimulus.
Perhaps unconsciously, he has mimicked the directive of Irving Fisher, one of the United States’ first great economists, who likened the task of central bankers to that of steering a bicycle: “Turn the wheel slightly, and if that is not enough, you turn it some more, or if you turn it too much, you turn it back.”

Such an approach can work in normal times.
Indeed, the United States has spent only 16 months of the last quarter-century in recession — a vast improvement over previous eras.
The recent period has been called the Great Moderation; growth cycles have evened out, and inflation has abated in almost every country around the globe.
But will it work now?
The Fed faces not only the twin demons of recession and inflation but also the specter that further rate cuts would cause foreign investors — who own more than $2 trillion of U.S. debt — to bail out, sending U.S. interest rates soaring.
That, combined with the steadily worsening housing slump, could make for a long and nasty recession.
And it would mark the end to the Great Moderation.
Perhaps the Great Moderation has been the result of good luck.
Or perhaps it has been because of improved management skills —business learning not to overstock inventories, for example.
Bernanke has written that it is something else.
He sees it as a result, in large part, of better monetary policies.
He says that central bankers have finally learned how to guide economies — not with mystique but with economic science.
If that is so, we will not need a wizard behind the curtain anymore, only intelligent engineers who can steer markets to a promised land of rational expectations.
To prove that he is right, Bernanke will need to minimize or, if possible, avoid the looming recession that looks ever more likely.
It will not be easy.
Bernanke’s education has just begun.
The Big Dog relished playing the candidate again, wearing a Technicolor orange tie and sweeping across the state with the mute Chelsea.
“I’m not standing in his way,” he said.
“I think Hillary would be a better president” who’s “ready to do the job on the first day.” He added: “No one has a right to be president, including Hillary.
Keep in mind, in the last two primaries, we ran as an underdog.” He rewrote the facts, saying that “no one thought she could win” in New Hampshire, even though she originally had had a substantial lead.
He said of Obama: “I hope I get a chance to vote for him some day.” And that day, of course, would be after Hillary’s eight years; it’s her turn now because Bill owes her.
“I think it would be just as much a change, and some people think more, to have the first woman president as to have the first African-American president,” he said.
Bad Bill had been roughing up Obama so much that Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina suggested that he might want to “chill.” On a conference call with reporters yesterday, the former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a national co-chairman of the Obama campaign, tut-tutted that the “incredible distortions” of the political beast were “not keeping with the image of a former president.”

Jonathan Alter reported in Newsweek that Senator Edward Kennedy and Rahm Emanuel, the Illinois congressman and former Clinton aide, have heatedly told Bill “that he needs to change his tone and stop attacking Senator Barack Obama.”
In the Myrtle Beach debate Monday night, Obama was fed up with being double-teamed by the Clintons.

“I can’t tell who I’m running against sometimes,” he snapped at Hillary, obviously entrapped and psyched-out by the Clinton duo.
The Clintons, he said “spent the last month attacking me in ways that are not accurate.
At some point, it’s important for me to answer.” Recalling that Hillary had called mixing it up the “fun” part of politics, he said: “I don’t think it’s the fun part to fudge the truth.”

Bill has merged with his wife totally now, talking about “we” and “us.” “I never did anything major without discussing it with her,” he told a crowd here.
“We’ve been having this conversation since we first met in 1971, and I don’t think we’ll stop now.” He suggested as First Lad that “I can help to sell the domestic program.”
It’s odd that the first woman with a shot at becoming president is so openly dependent on her husband to drag her over the finish line.
She handed over South Carolina to him, knowing that her support here is largely derivative.
“I would be willing to engage in a dancing competition with him, even though he’s much younger and thinner than I am,” he said.
“If I’m going to get in one of these brother contests,” he added, “at least I should be entitled to an age allowance.”
He said, “I kind of like seeing Barack and Hillary fighting.”
“How great is this?” he said.
“Neither of them has to be a little wind-up doll who’s supposed to behave in a certain way.
They’re real people, flesh and blood people.
They have differences.”
And if he has anything to say about it, and he will, they’ll be fighting till the last dog dies.
Indeed, this month two important software programs make their debut.
One is a minor upgrade from a big company: Microsoft Office 2008 for Macintosh.
The other is a big deal from a tiny company: MacSpeech Dictate, a new speech-recognition program.

Office first.
The basic version of this software package ($150) comes with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage, an e-mail/calendar/address book program.
Office for the Mac still isn’t as powerful (or as confusing) as the Windows version, but it has its charms.
For example, the Mac programs have been rewritten to exploit the modern Mac’s Intel processor (instead of running in a slower simulation mode, as Office 2004 did).
This, frankly, is the best part.
When you type in Word or delete a message from Entourage, the response is smart and snappy.
There’s no more fraction-of-a-second delay when you type in Word, and no more mysterious 90-second lockups in Entourage.
Furthermore, the whole thing has been successfully redesigned to match the look of Mac OS X.
The fonts, color schemes and tool panels look like they’ve come straight from the designers at Apple — especially the palette that lets you drop your iPhoto pictures into Word or the other programs.
Photo
Considering the four-year gap since the last version came along, Microsoft hasn’t added much.
For example, you get a global search in Entourage, formula auto-complete in Excel, control over PowerPoint slide shows with the Apple remote, and a terrific page-layout view in Word, complete with linked boxes with auto-flowing text.
Office 2008 also lets you save your documents, if you like, in the new, more compact file formats of Office 2007 for Windows (ending in .docx, .xlsx and so on).
Blockbuster new features, however, are nonexistent.
Worse, one old blockbuster feature is now nonexistent: macros, the recording and playback of routine steps.
This is a devastating loss to power users.
In 2008, it’s all gone.
If you’re geekily inclined, you can recreate some of these software robots using the Mac’s own AppleScript language; Microsoft is readying a guide for doing just that.
Otherwise, for Microsoft to remove any power-user features at this stage seems like a risky move; there are plenty of simpler, less expensive Office-compatible programs, including Apple’s own $80 iWork suite and the free Google Apps.

The other Mac software news this month is more exciting.
For years, the industry’s most amazing speech-recognition program has been Dragon NaturallySpeaking for Windows.
Seven years ago, I asked iListen’s creator, a former Dragon engineer named Andrew Taylor, why on earth he’d based his Mac program on the Philips software instead of Dragon’s.

The answer, it turns out, was that the Dragon technology would cost too much, and the conditions for using it were too onerous, in Mr. Taylor’s view.
The new program, MacSpeech Dictate ($200 with headset), is a big deal, especially for the thousands of Mac lovers who have been running Windows all these years just so they could use Dragon NaturallySpeaking.
Photo
MacSpeech Dictate is fast and accurate, pouring correctly transcribed text into any program where you ordinarily type, as fast as you can speak.
When I read a 1,000-word book excerpt, the program transcribed only nine words incorrectly — 99.1 percent accuracy.
(I had read the four-minute training script and fed the program a folder full of documents I’d written, which is how you introduce special terminology and names to the program’s dictionary.)
You get a giddy feeling the first time you see Dictate in action; you can’t help contemplating how much more e-mail you’ll be able to plow through in a day, or how your aching hands will no longer have to keep up with your brain when you’re writing.
Dictate can also operate your computer.
You can say “Open iMovie” or “Open Calculator,” for example.
You can also speak menu commands and button names, and you can select text that you’ve already dictated earlier (“Select ‘five score and six years ago’ ”).
At that point, you can delete it, format it or replace the highlighted phrase.
You can also run AppleScript programs or open Web sites by voice.
All you see of the program when you’re using it are two small translucent floating windows (both of which you can hide, if you like).
One contains the microphone on/off button.
The other, called Available Commands, shows you what commands are available at the moment.
Here’s where you discover, for example, the delightful “scratch that” command that deletes your last utterance and the “cap” command that capitalizes the next word you speak.

The program also lets you create voice macros, where you say one thing (“buzz off”) and it types out something different (“I respect your opinion, but I’m afraid we’ll have to agree to disagree on this one”).
That’s a huge time-saver for anyone whose work entails repetitive answers or clauses.
So Dictate 1.0 is attractive, simple and Mac-like.
It is not, however, as good as NaturallySpeaking 9.0 for Windows ($200).
It lacks features like audio playback of what you said, a simple “add word” command, legal and medical versions, and non-English language kits.
It also lacks voice correction.
When NatSpeak makes an error, you just say “Correct ‘ax a moron’ ” (or whatever it typed); and choose from a list of alternate transcriptions.
The program not only corrects the error in your document, but also learns from its mistake.
Over time, the accuracy edges ever closer to 100 percent.
In Dictate 1.0, however, you have to fix transcription errors by hand.
The company intends to add voice correction in a 1.1 update; in the meantime, though, your accuracy won’t improve.
The late beta version I tested has some bugs.
The company intends to get these fixed by the 1.0 version’s mid-February release.
Even so, Dictate gets the big things — speed and accuracy — right, which may be enough for a lot of people.
This program and the new Mac Office fill big holes in the Macintosh landscape — a landscape that’s looking brighter all the time.
And sending checks to people in good financial shape does little or nothing to increase overall spending.
People who have good incomes, good credit and secure employment make spending decisions based on their long-term earning power rather than the size of their latest paycheck.
Give such people a few hundred extra dollars, and they’ll just put it in the bank.

In fact, that appears to be what mainly happened to the tax rebates affluent Americans received during the last recession in 2001.
On the other hand, money delivered to people who aren’t in good financial shape — who are short on cash and living check to check — does double duty: it alleviates hardship and also pumps up consumer spending.
That’s why many of the stimulus proposals we were hearing just a few days ago focused in the first place on expanding programs that specifically help people who have fallen on hard times, especially unemployment insurance and food stamps.
Photo
There was also some talk among Democrats about providing temporary aid to state and local governments, whose finances are being pummeled by the weakening economy.
Like help for the unemployed, this would have done double duty, averting hardship and heading off spending cuts that could worsen the downturn.
But the Bush administration has apparently succeeded in killing all of these ideas, in favor of a plan that mainly gives money to those least likely to spend it.
Why would the administration want to do this?
It has nothing to do with economic efficacy: no economic theory or evidence I know of says that upper-middle-class families are more likely to spend rebate checks than the poor and unemployed.
Instead, what seems to be happening is that the Bush administration refuses to sign on to anything that it can’t call a “tax cut.”

Behind that refusal, in turn, lies the administration’s commitment to slashing tax rates on the affluent while blocking aid for families in trouble — a commitment that requires maintaining the pretense that government spending is always bad.
And the result is a plan that not only fails to deliver help where it’s most needed, but is likely to fail as an economic measure.
The words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt come to mind: “We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics.”
And the worst of it is that the Democrats, who should have been in a strong position — does this administration have any credibility left on economic policy?
— appear to have caved in almost completely.

Yes, they extracted some concessions, increasing rebates for people with low income while reducing giveaways to the affluent.
And that could turn out to be a very bad thing.
We don’t know for sure how deep the coming slump will be, or even whether it will meet the technical definition of a recession.
(For more on this, see my blog at krugman.blogs.nytimes.com.)
And if that happens, we’ll deeply regret the fact that the Bush administration insisted on, and Democrats accepted, a so-called stimulus plan that just won’t do the job.

Now that lower rates are a factor, Ms. Cannon said, the question becomes: At what point will buyers be compelled to act, thinking they are getting a price they can live with and a rate they do not want to miss?
One indisputable effect of the Fed action is a rise in refinancing applications, continuing a trend that started late last year.
The New York Loan Exchange, a marketplace used by mortgage companies and the investment banks they sell loans to, experienced a big spike in activity starting Tuesday as loan officers logged on to see if they could get lower rates for borrowers.

Purchase applications are a different story.
Kimberly Raber, a sales assistant at a pharmaceutical company, is doing her best to raise that number.
She lives in a cramped apartment in Vista, Calif., with her fiancé and their two children.
For six months, they have been looking for a bigger place.
He would not go below $377,000, and she could not go above $363,000.
“Now that the rates have gone down, we’re hoping to meet in the middle,” said Ms. Raber, 36.
“The rental market is very hot,” he said.
“That’s my plan — to buy cheap, rent to families cheap.”
Mr. Anderson’s agent, Otha Greer with Coldwell Banker, said he was not alone.
The drop in rates “has lit the fire in my business,” Ms. Greer said.
“I actually had an investor that called yesterday and she’s interested in buying five homes.”
Among sellers, too, the cut is inspiring flickers of optimism.
Switching agents and lowering the price to $98,000 did not help.

In October, they took the home off the market so they could remodel a bathroom and bedroom.
When the work is done, they said, they will try to sell the home again, probably at a lower price.
They calculate that a buyer could pay as little as $700 a month.
“Why would someone want to rent if they could own and pay the same thing?” asked Ms. LeCursi, who works in rehabilitation at the University of Michigan in nearby Ann Arbor.
“People need incentive.
Hopefully, that rate cut will supply it."
Such is the depth of the downturn, however, that for many, the incentives are not enough.
“I don’t have anyone interested in refinancing,” said Patricia Nosan Bednarcik, an agent in hard-hit Cleveland.
“Dollars to doughnuts, most people probably owe more than what the house is worth right now.
And that’s a problem since housing prices will probably fall even more.”

That is as much an article of faith in the current environment as was the conviction in 2004 that prices would never go down.
Indeed, the forecasts now are getting bleaker.
In an uphill battle to combat such attitudes, the National Association of Realtors started a print, radio and television ad campaign this month that emphasizes real estate as an investment.
“If you purchase one of the millions of homes that will be sold this year, the National Association of Realtors wants you to know that you’re making a good move,” says one of the TV ads.
“The cut gave him a nice feeling, but it wasn’t enough to get him to buy, or even get in his car to go look,” Mr. Klinge said.
Raising the loan limits is especially significant in high-priced California.
As part of the stimulus legislation before Congress, lenders for a year would be able to sell much larger loans to the havens of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage finance companies.
The limit would increase from the current $417,000 to at least $625,500 and possible as much as $729,750.
The exact amount is still being negotiated.
That should make refinancings easier, and would probably encourage sales activity, too.
The same is true of another provision of the plan, to increase the limit on loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration to $729,750.
In the distance, I glimpsed a bobbing line of white horns swooping down the hillside.
We found Mugira by the watering hole, whistling and waving a wooden switch called an enkoni, frantically trying to keep his Ankoles away.

“You know, in Uganda, we have to look for survival of the fittest,” Mugira said once he finished sorting out the confusion.
“These ones, they are the fittest,” he went on to say, gesturing toward his Holsteins.
Holsteins are lactating behemoths.
In an African setting, a good one can produce 20 or 30 times as much milk as an Ankole.
Their language contains a vast catalog of cattle names, which refer to characteristics like color and hide pattern.
The ideal Ankole, Mugira told me, has a lustrous brown coat and gleaming horns that curve out and then inward, forming a shape like a lyre.
“They are naturally good,” Mugira said.
“They are beautiful.
Experts are warning of a potential “meltdown” in global genetic diversity.
Yet the plight of the Ankole illustrates the difficulty of balancing the conflicting goals of animal conservation and human prosperity.
An estimated 70 percent of the world’s rural poor, some 630 million people, derive a substantial percentage of their income from livestock.
Increase the productivity of these animals, development specialists say, and you improve dire living standards.
The World Bank recently published a report saying it was time to place farming “afresh at the center of the development agenda.” Highly productive livestock breeds, the World Bank asserts, are playing an important role in alleviating poverty.
“You do have local animals with various kinds of disease resistance and whatever other kinds of things you don’t want to do away with,” said Chris Delgado, an agriculture policy adviser at the World Bank.
“But there’s a problem: They are kept by very poor people, and they don’t want to stay poor.”
Every cow in the world is the product of some human agency.
The extinct feral ancestor of all cattle, the auroch, was a fearsome horned creature that could grow to be six feet tall.
There are two theories about the taming of wild aurochs.
The traditional view holds that it happened around 6000 B.C.
in the Fertile Crescent.
But recent archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that domestication may have first occurred in Africa 2,000 years earlier, in the then-lush plains of the eastern Sahara.
For millennia, changing a breed’s genetics through husbandry required a long trial-and-error process.
But today it can happen in an evolutionary eye blink.
Multinational breeding companies, many of them based in the United States, collect semen from prime bulls, freeze it and export it to the developing world.
Official estimates say there are about three million Ankole cattle in Uganda and smaller populations in bordering nations.
An unknown — though by all accounts large — percentage of them are in the process of being turned into something else.
After one cross with a Holstein, the brown Ankole cow will produce a black calf with darkened horns.
After two, the horns will shrink and a dappled coat will appear.
The third generation will basically look like American dairy cattle.
With each cross, the offspring will produce more milk.
The World Bank estimates that 1.8 million small-scale farmers in East Africa are benefiting from such genetic changes to their cattle and that some 100 million cows and pigs are created through artificial insemination in poor countries each year.
Those numbers substantially understate the extent of genetic interchange, because half the offspring produced by artificial insemination are male and spread their genes the old-fashioned way.
To see the evolution in Ugandan dairy cattle, I visited a farmer named Jackson Sezibwa, who lives down a reddish dirt path outside the central Ugandan town of Mukono.
He showed me to the metal-roofed stall where he keeps his Holstein, Kevina.
Founded in 1944 by Dan West, an Indiana farmer, Heifer’s mission is to take quality livestock to impoverished places.
In Uganda, the cattle breed Heifer prefers is the Holstein.
“The American cow,” said Dr. Margaret Makuru, Heifer’s deputy country director, “once you feed it, it is a factory.”

Like any factory owner, Jackson Sezibwa had to think about inputs and outputs.
Making milk requires energy, which means eating grass.
Holsteins require much more grass than Ankole cattle, but unlike Ankoles, which need to roam, Holsteins can be kept in pens.
They don’t have any resistance to tropical diseases like trypanosomiasis — colloquially known as sleeping sickness — and East Coast Fever, which is spread by ticks.
(A typical Ankole would have given him between a quarter and a half gallon.)
In a country where an estimated 85 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day, that’s substantial income.
The money finances school for Sezibwa’s six children.
Sezibwa gave away her first calf to a neighbor, in keeping with Heifer’s philosophy of “passing the gift.” The next two — both males — he sold to farmers eager to acquire Holstein genetics, making enough profit to build himself a nice brick house.
Jackson Sezibwa is just one man, but Uganda’s economy is made up of millions like him.
Agriculture accounts for 30 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, and 10 percent of that comes from the livestock sector.
growth originating in agriculture is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty” as other types of growth.
Today, even after recent increases, the World Bank devotes less than 10 percent of its development assistance to agriculture, down from 30 percent a quarter-century ago.
Recently, the notion of helping poor farmers by making farming more lucrative has been dusted off by a new generation of economists.
And Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation have promised to finance a second Green Revolution.
But governmental aid agencies have been slower to rediscover the importance of agriculture.
Farming initiatives now account for just 4 percent of the assistance distributed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of the world’s most developed nations.
The U.S. Agency for International Development budgeted $392 million for agricultural programs last year, including a significant proportion to promote milk production.
Crossbreeding is an important component of its strategy.
“We should be able to do farming as a business, not sentimentally,” said Dr. Paul Kimbugwe, the Land O’Lakes country manager.
“Making money means you have to crossbreed.
And crossbreeding means that you are doing away with the genetics of that cow,” meaning the Ankole, “which I also encourage.”
Not everyone in Uganda, however, agrees that the foreign breeds are an upgrade.
Museveni belongs to the Bahima ethnic group.
Museveni, now in his 60s, still owns the descendants of that very cow, and he retains a strong bond to the Ankole breed.
“No, those are pollution,” Museveni replied.
“These,” he said, referring to his Ankoles, “the genetic material is superior.”
If the Ankole cattle are able to mount a comeback, it will be because circumstances have endowed them with a unique set of defenses, both evolutionary and political.
Members of President Museveni’s ethnic group populate the upper ranks of Uganda’s government.
Some prominent Bahima have started an organization devoted to preserving Ankoles, under the patronage of a one-eyed army general who spends his free time painting rapturous portraits of cows.
“They are excited about having these big earnings, and they are forgetting the cultural aspect.”

Kimbugwe, the Land O’Lakes representative, has a ready reply to such arguments.
“Culture — fine, it’s good to have,” he said.
“But first, the stomachs.” He views the Ankole as an atavistic indulgence for the country’s elite.
Competition for land is forcing cows onto smaller pastures.
Uganda has one of the highest birth rates in the world, and despite its poverty and diseases like AIDS, the population has more than doubled since 1980.
There’s a long history of tension between the Bahima and an agriculturalist ethnic group, the Bairu, which coexist in western Uganda, at times less than happily.
This is a common dynamic across Africa.
In Rwanda, a similar ethnic conflict between cattle-keeping Tutsis and farming Hutus culminated in genocide in 1994.
A number of experts say the “ethnic” war in Darfur is really a fight over grass.
Uganda has not experienced that level of conflict, but the local newspapers are filled with stories of violent skirmishes between farmers and encroaching pastoralists.
This is one reason that some say Holsteins represent the future.
Rwanda, now ruled by longhorn-loving Tutsis but trying to address the causes of the genocide, is enthusiastically encouraging the breed’s introduction, with assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development.

No one knows how many Ankole cattle exist.
“We’ve been saying the Ankoles are 50 percent of the national herd, but I don’t think that’s true anymore,” said Dr. Denis Mpairwe, an animal scientist at Uganda’s Makerere University.
“The crossbreeding the last five years has been so intense.” The International Livestock Research Institute predicts that if present trends continue, the Ankoles could go extinct within 50 years.
But Mpairwe says he believes it could happen much sooner.
I lived in Uganda between 2002 and 2004, and I couldn’t believe the change.
“Almost 100 percent are crosses.” He pointed up toward the hilltops, normally gently rounded and green, but now sandy in large patches from overgrazing.
The two scientists are studying how high-producing cattle interact with the African ecosystem.
If cows are like factories, you could say an Ankole is powered by a water wheel, while the Holstein requires a nuclear reactor.
The principle of the “tragedy of the commons,” perhaps the most famous metaphor in ecology, is a cattle parable.
It was first described by a 19th-century British economist and popularized by the biologist Garrett Hardin in a 1968 Science magazine essay about human overpopulation.
Hardin was trying to refute the view that an unregulated free market invariably produces beneficial outcomes.
The benefit of adding a single calf went to each individual farmer, while the cost of adding that calf (the grass it would consume) would be distributed to all pasture users.
“Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit — in a world that is limited,” he wrote.
The commons, he predicted, would inevitably be picked clean.
With the introduction of the Holsteins, something similar seems to be happening in Uganda.
Farmers aren’t literally increasing the sizes of their herds, but they are creating herds that consume unsustainable amounts of dwindling resources.
And something else is being obliterated: genes.
Each time a farmer crossbreeds his Ankoles, a little of the country’s stockpile of adaptive traits disappears.
It isn’t easy to measure genetic “dilution.” What is evident, however, is that the Ankoles possess much worth saving.
For instance, their horns, often seen as ornaments, actually disperse excess body heat.
Holsteins don’t like heat.
While a poorly adapted animal can survive for years in a harsh ecosystem, even a slight worsening of their conditions can have devastating effects.

“For countries on the equator, I think in almost all cases the Holstein is very poorly suited — maybe the least-suited breed,” says Dr. Les Hansen, a professor at the University of Minnesota and a leading expert in cattle genetics.
Often farmers are making decisions that are informed not by science, he said, but by sales pitches devised by multinational breeding concerns.
“As I travel the world,” Hansen adds, “my biggest challenge is countering all of the misleading marketing propaganda.”

The world market in cattle breeding is controlled by a handful of companies, several of them based in the United States.
The companies maintain facilities where they extract semen from bulls, keep genetic databases, publish rankings and cultivate a sort of bovine star system.
Hansen’s research suggests that every Holstein is descended from Chief and Elevation, and that 30 percent of all the Holstein genes in the world are traceable to those two bulls.
That has created a serious problem with inbreeding, which has adverse effects on fertility and mortality.
But overseas markets like Africa are, so to speak, virgin territory.
According to industry figures, American companies exported 10 million “doses” of cattle semen in 2006.
In Uganda, a company called World-Wide Sires, the international marketing arm of two American breeding cooperatives, is working with aid agencies to increase dairy production.
“The proof is in the bucket,” said George Nuwagira, a dairy farmer who is also the World-Wide Sires sales representative for western Uganda.
A stout, garrulous fellow, he was wearing a yellow baseball cap with a smiling cartoon cow on it.
He didn’t care about the Ankole.
“To me as a modern farmer, the horns don’t mean anything,” Nuwagira said.
He didn’t name his cows like the Bahima but instead referred to them by numbers.
But these days, things have changed.
When you talk of animals they don’t ask you the numbers.
They ask you the production.”
Nuwagira’s biggest problem was getting his product to market.
“You feed them, they will give you the volumes, but there are times when we find we are stuck having nowhere to sell it,” he explained.
Milk is perishable, and Uganda is a country where roads are bad and refrigeration is rare.
The dairy trade in rural areas is largely controlled by bicycle vendors who sell raw milk from aluminum jugs.
Anyway, some Ugandan tribes don’t drink milk.
They’re lactose-intolerant.
Crossbreeding follows the logic of the arms race.
But they’ve had to change because their neighbors are changing.
The volume of milk produced in Uganda doubled between 1993 and 2003, but in the absence of a surge in demand or improved delivery systems, the product has literally flooded the market.
As the price per liter has fallen, dairy farmers have had to rearm with Holsteins just to maintain their usual profit margins.
International organizations realize that increased productivity means little if it’s not accompanied by market growth.
That’s why the U.S. Agency for International Development is spending millions across Africa to promote dairy cooperatives and pay for advertisements inspired by America’s famous “Got Milk?” campaign.
But changing distribution and diets isn’t as easy as changing breeds.
“A lot of consumers don’t understand how important milk is,” says Jim Yazman, a livestock specialist with the agency.
Economic forces can push a breed to extinction with frightening swiftness.
In Vietnam, where pigs are the most important livestock species and the government has encouraged leaner foreign breeds, the percentage of indigenous sows has fallen to 28 percent from 72 percent since 1994, and 13 of the 15 local breeds are classified as either extinct or in danger.
Then, in just 15 years, indiscriminate crossbreeding with woollier imported sheep nearly drove them out of existence.

Many tropical breeds may possess unique adaptive traits.
The problem is, we don’t know what is being lost.
While data on many breeds are scant, the report found that over the last six years, an average of one breed a month has gone extinct.
“The threat is imminent,” says Danielle Nierenberg, senior researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group.
“Just getting milk and meat into people’s mouths is not the answer.”
As the world’s climate warms, and the environment becomes more inhospitable to the major breeds, humanity might need the genes that allow animals like the Ankoles to flourish in the African heat.
The challenge is to safeguard the resource.
There are two possible approaches: putting the animals in cold storage, or changing the economic equation.
Proponents of the first option desire something like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a doomsday depository for plant species that an international consortium is building in the Arctic Circle.
But storing sperm and embryos is far more expensive and technically difficult.
Biodiversity advocates say that it would be preferable, anyway, for breeds like the Ankole to go on living in their pastures.
The most obvious way to do that would be to create incentives to entice farmers to keep them.
But even those who want to save endangered breeds recognize that subsidizing unproductive livestock in hungry countries is problematic.
In November, at a conference sponsored by the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, Dr. Edward Rege, the organization’s biotechnology director, gave a speech listing several “inconvenient facts” about conventional wisdom in the field, adding that conservation approaches can effectively amount to “saying that farmers should remain poor.”
The best hope for the Ankoles may reside at a modest, terraced complex on a breezy hillside in Uganda overlooking Lake Victoria in the old colonial town of Entebbe.
It was constructed by the British in 1960, at the height of the Green Revolution, as an artificial-insemination center and a staging ground for introducing new breeds — animals that mostly died off during the subsequent wars and dictatorships.
Now called the National Animal Genetic Resources Center and Databank, the facility’s new mission is to save indigenous animals like the Ankoles by giving them better care and selectively breeding them to compete in production.
The center keeps a dozen bulls of different breeds, including two immense Ankoles that once belonged to President Museveni.
Twice a week, technicians collect semen, which is used to inseminate cows at government farms or else packaged and sold directly to farmers.
If it’s successful, the program could offer a model to other developing nations.
If, on the other hand, the Ankole cattle can’t be saved even with such government support, it’s difficult to imagine how any threatened breed will survive.
“They can produce milk and they put on meat,” said Dr. Dan Semambo, the center’s executive director.
“People don’t know what they have.”
Ugandans rave about the fresh milk out west, and every rancher I visited there served me a cup.
It has a delicious sweet thickness.
No matter how well nourished they are, though, the Ankoles probably can’t produce as much milk as the Holsteins.
Instead, the breed’s salvation could lie in the slaughterhouse.
President Museveni says he believes that Ankoles make exceptional beef cattle and wants to export their meat.
Some studies suggest that Ankole beef is unusually lean and low in cholesterol.
Mpairwe and his colleagues at Makerere University are completing a study in which Ankoles and crossbreeds were kept on nutrient-rich diets.
We met one evening at Le Petit Bistro, a European-owned restaurant that serves Kampala’s best steak.
“Ankole cattle, they are the best,” he said.
“I can tell in the tenderness.” I had my filet with a little garlic butter.
It was almost as if you could taste the contentment of an unbounded life on the open range.
Many historians have assumed that Europe’s deadliest plague, the Black Death of 1347 to 1351, killed indiscriminately, young and old, hardy and frail, healthy and sick alike.
Although it may not be surprising that healthy people would be more likely to survive an illness, it is not always the case.
Sexually transmitted infections like H.I.V.
disproportionately affect the strongest and healthiest, for the obvious reason that they are the most sexually active.
Plague is caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis, and it is usually transmitted to humans by fleas; flea-infested rats caused the 14th-century epidemic.
The bacteria invade the bloodstream, causing internal bleeding that leads to shock and death.

The scientists determined the victims’ state of health when they died by counting bone lesions, defects that suggest previous infections and other existing health problems.
The researchers also estimated age at death by noting dental development and using other established methods.
If the Black Death killed without discrimination, such skeletal defects would not be associated with an increased risk of death in East Smithfield.
Many of the victims would have had healthy-looking bones when the plague killed them.

Most of the bone defects that the researchers found can be caused by malnutrition, and the scientists suggest that the findings may show effects of starvation on immune function.
It is known from contemporary chronicles that many survived the plague, and they, the authors write, were probably well fed and healthy enough to mount an effective immune response.
“Even something as clearly deadly as the Black Death is still selective,” said Sharon N. DeWitte, a co-author of the study and an assistant professor of anthropology at the State University at Albany.
The Black Death, she continued, is comparable in some ways to various emerging diseases of today like Ebola or SARS, and studying it “gives us some insight into who might be at highest risk for these new diseases.”
The authors acknowledge that their findings are not conclusive.
The samples used were from two geographic areas, and similar lesions could have been caused by diseases of varying severity in the two areas.
Still, the authors write, the fact that a pattern of excess mortality was associated with different kinds of lesions suggests that the plague more often killed the weak than the strong.
“The stalling of the United States economy last quarter makes the need urgent for significant economic stimulus,” Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement.
“Alarm bells should be going off.”

But some economists say the fate of the economy is already sealed: While stimulus spending could ease the bite of a downturn, it can no longer avert one.
“The country is now teetering on the edge of recession,” wrote Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, in a note to clients.
“It is very doubtful that anything Washington can put together will work fast enough to revive economic activity this year.”
The slowdown reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday underscored the array of challenges confronting the economy, which has emerged as the key issue in a presidential race that only months ago seemed likely to focus on the war in Iraq.
Housing prices have been plummeting, depriving Americans of a crucial source of wealth and curbing spending.
Banks have lost tens of billions of dollars on bad mortgage bets, leaving them reluctant to lend, thus dampening new investments.
The job market has been slowing, taking wages out of the economy and further constraining growth.
Yet even as economic activity grinds down, the report added fresh reason to worry about inflation — rising prices propelled by the high cost of energy, food and other crucial goods.
Over all, the prices of goods purchased by Americans swelled by 3.8 percent in the last three months of 2007, compared with 1.8 percent in the previous three months.
Excluding energy and food, prices still climbed by 2.5 percent for the quarter.
“The one-word description of this report is ‘stagflation,’ ” said Ethan S. Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, using a term that harks back to the 1970s, when many economies throughout the world saw both rising prices and stagnant growth in the midst of an energy crisis.
“This isn’t exactly great news for the economy going forward.”
The growing threat of inflation highlighted the difficult ground that must be navigated by the Federal Reserve as it charts policy.
In recent months, the Fed has been dropping interest rates aggressively to encourage consumers to spend and businesses to invest, while putting aside worries that cheap credit will exacerbate inflation.
Some economists assert the Fed is risking larger problems down the road to stave off immediate discomfort.
The market has been anticipating that the Fed will ease the rate at which banks lend to one another overnight by another half-point on Wednesday afternoon.
That rate indirectly affects rates charged by banks for a host of commercial services, from auto loans to mortgages.

Policy makers and investors are looking to a snapshot of the nation’s employment situation scheduled to be released on Friday.

But in recent days, fresh signals have suggested that the job market may not be deteriorating.
New claims for unemployment have been dropping since mid-December.
The ADP report has been a far from perfect indicator, but if it proves an accurate preview this time, that would cushion against fears of a rapid unraveling.
In recent months, some economists have suggested that American companies might find enough sales abroad to compensate for deteriorating business at home, pointing to faster growing economies in Europe, Asia and Latin America.
Slowing export growth suggests that weakening demand for goods in the United States is slowing economies around the world.
The report reinforced how the unraveling of the American real estate market continues to assail the economy, with spending on new-home building plunging 23.9 percent in the last three months of 2007 — the largest quarterly drop in 26 years.
The report showed a slight erosion in consumer spending, which amounts to 70 percent of the American economy.
“It’s all the headwinds that consumers are facing,” Ms. Zentner said.
“Consumers have run out of funding now that they can’t tap into their houses for finance They’re facing high gas prices and overall inflation.
They’re getting bombarded by headlines about how bad the economy is, which makes them worry about their personal finances.”

But some analysts said fears of a downturn are overblown, suggesting that the slowdown amounts to the momentary leftovers of the global credit panic that broke out last summer, as the extent of mortgage losses emerged.
Global credit markets have already loosened substantially, he said, adding that if the United States can avoid recession for a few more months, the low interest rates delivered by the Fed will then kick in, fueling fresh economic activity.
Private businesses like factories and retailers decreased their inventories by $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter after expanding them by $30.6 billion in the third.
While that is consistent with a slowdown, it also means that inventories are now lean, making a sharp pullback in production less likely.
“That takes some of the edge off the report,” Mr. Zandi said.
Unfortunately, this is a case of the rich getting richer, and the poor being left holding the bag, or at least holding, and perhaps losing, the homes they wish they had never bought.
Even people with sterling credit will be unable to refinance if their homes are no longer worth what they owe.
Fraud enabled some buyers to qualify even if they could not meet the relaxed standards.
All that enabled home purchases by many young families, who a few years earlier would have expected to rent while saving up money for a down payment.
The number of homes being built soared, and residential construction came to account for a larger and larger share of the economy — a peak of 6.3 percent in mid-2005, up from about 4 percent in the late 1990s — and the number of new housing units rose faster than the population.

All that is over.
Banking regulators, who had insisted they could not regulate nonbank mortgage lenders, are now doing just that, barring many of the more generous lending practices.
Investors no longer want to buy the securities, which are costing banks multibillion-dollar write-offs, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking for cases of fraud.
Appraisers have gone from wildly optimistic to extremely cautious.
For home builders, the result is a plunge in demand.
“We don’t see this market turning around anytime soon,” said Antonio Mon, the chief executive of Tousa, a home builder that filed for bankruptcy this week.
“We are all building houses for practice.
We are not making any money from building houses.”

And that may get worse before it gets better.
It will take some time for all the houses now available to be absorbed by the reduced number of families who can qualify for mortgages.
And the sellers of those homes will face competition.
As Lennar, another builder with problems, said this week in its annual report, there is “an oversupply of alternatives to new homes, such as rental properties and used homes.”
Prices are plunging at an unprecedented rate.
According to the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller indexes of home prices, Miami’s prices have fallen more than 2 percent a month for four consecutive months.
In some markets, prices have fallen at a rate of more than 20 percent a year since the credit crisis began last summer.
It is to be expected that share prices of builders will recover before it is obvious that home prices are stabilizing and demand is coming back.
But the January rally is likely to turn out to be premature.
A changed world has reduced the number of possible home buyers, and the prices they can pay.
Neither the Fed nor Congress has the power to reverse those changes.

If she does not miss any payments, she will own the television by the summer, for a total of about $900.
Such televisions can be bought retail for well under $400, but that would require more money than Deborah Williams can put her hands on at one time.
This is a big week in the television rental business.
In 117 weeks, the customer would own the set outright, for $5,558.
If this were set up as a loan, the interest rate would be 71 percent and illegal under the usury laws.

would have such far-reaching effects.”
But to believe that Bernanke, with access to exponentially more insider information than most of us, as well as a deep knowledge of history, failed to see that they could have far-reaching effects seems unlikely.
The real question is why he didn’t say anything.
By remaining silent, he allowed a bad situation to get much, much worse.
It’s possible the investment banks were not forthcoming about the extent of their practice of bundling subprime junk with more secure prime loans into exotic derivatives instruments, expanding the damage even further.
If Bernanke was misled in that regard, he has good reason to be mad and should be condemning the lack of fiduciary responsibility of everyone involved and arguing for long-overdue regulation of a derivatives market run amok.
Instead, he is bailing the gamblers out as much as he can, with more cheap money, to help them pay for their shenanigans.
Perhaps because he knows the Fed is also partly to blame.

Lowenstein’s article was superb, but I have a caution about the suggestion that the Taylor Rule “has downsized” the chairman’s job to some extent.
In real time, using the Taylor Rule requires estimating a statistic that is purely conjectural — the current value of the “output gap” between actual and potential gross domestic product.
In real time, we have a pretty good estimate of actual G.D.P., but the level and rate of growth of potential G.D.P.
are projections.
Using the Taylor Rule requires deep insight into productivity and labor and product markets.
It’s not a downsized job.

LAST month the Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to food made from cloned cows, pigs and goats, with the agency’s top food-safety expert, Dr. Stephen Sundlof, declaring, “It is beyond our imagination to even have a theory for why the food is unsafe.” Opponents of biotechnology immediately let out a collective groan of disapproval — among them Jerry Greenfield of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream (who has called cloning “just weird”).
Cloning, after all, will now join genetically modified crops as yet another threat to organic agriculture.
I, too, let out a groan, but for a different reason.
“It is beyond our imagination to even find a theory ....” The hubris here highlights the saddest aspect of our perennial food wars.
Like abortion and capital punishment, biotechnology inspires knee-jerk rhetorical passion rather than rational debate.
One need look no further than the battle over genetically modified crops starting in the 1990s to understand how this language undermines the qualified benefits of biotech innovation.
Without a hint of doubt, pro-biotech forces insisted that genetically modified crops would end hunger and eliminate the need for pesticides.
Genetic modification was supposedly a harmless panacea that would save the planet.
What emerged from this investigation — undertaken by population experts, plant biologists, farmers, conservationists, nonprofit foundations and agricultural scientists — was cautious optimism for a new technology.
These specialists recognized that such crops could reduce deforestation by increasing crop yields on less land, moderate overuse of synthetic insecticides, decrease dependence on irrigation through drought-resistant crops, and greatly reduce soil erosion through no-till farming.

But the middle ground also confronted the dangers that could arise through genetically modified crops.
Indeed, it is possible for cross-pollination to “contaminate” wild varieties of food, decreasing biodiversity.
Likewise, it is possible (if very unlikely) that animals fed modified crops could pass genes to humans that render antibiotics ineffective.
That patents of transgenic methods are controlled by a few deep-pocketed corporations is also unsettling.
One need not be an anti-biotech radical to have problems with a “terminator gene” that prevents crops from producing second-generation seed.
Rather than dismiss these concerns (as Monsanto does) or grossly overstate them (as Greenpeace and Mr. Rifkin do), people like Per Pinstrup-Andersen, the former director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute, have asked a profoundly productive question: what are the limits of modern society’s precautionary principle?
In other words, knowing that it is impossible to prove a negative, when should a society agree to accept a technology with proven benefits and potential dangers?
Dr. Pinstrup-Andersen, for one, decided that the benefits of modified crops outweigh the drawbacks.
I hope that the same situation does not play out on cloning.
After all, our collective failure to grapple with genetic modification on its own terms been accompanied by the equally unfortunate failure to bring its benefits to cultures that might gain the most from it — insect-resistant cassava or drought-tolerant maize could be a boon to subsistence farmers in Africa.
Cloning technology, too, has many possible benefits.
It has the potential to produce products that are safer, healthier and tastier — bacon that has heart-protective Omega 3’s, say, or milk produced by cows that are stronger and thus need fewer antibiotics.
It might seem “just weird,” but cloning deserves a fair hearing, one in which impassioned language yields the floor to responsible discourse.
were expected to have cast a vote in favor of a presidential candidate when the tally is complete.
On the Republican side, Mr. McCain, an Arizona senator, and Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, added last-minute California campaign stops on Monday, with Mr. Romney essentially toe-touching the state after a cross-country plane ride.
Mrs. Clinton, a New York senator, had her husband, the former President Bill Clinton, traveling the state to campaign for her among Democrats, and both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama, an Illinois senator, called in to a Spanish-language morning television show on Tuesday hoping to make inroads among Hispanic voters.

Unaffiliated or “decline-to-state” voters account for nearly 20 percent of registered voters in California, and more than 700,000 voters in Los Angeles County.
The Republican Party does not allow them to vote in its primary, but Democrats and the state’s American Independent Party do.
His campaign set off automated calls, or “robocalls,” to voters on Monday, reminding independent voters to fill in the second oval declaring that they were voting in the Democratic primary.
Still, the final results will be known in fuller detail on Wednesday, because roughly half the state’s primary voters cast paper ballots by mail, not in person at the polls.
Those ballots must be fed manually into scanners, following Ms. Bowen’s decision last year to decertify the vast majority of electronic voting machines on the ground that they were defective and vulnerable to tampering.

“Fine,” Ms. Frankel says.
Apparently he’d already said there was no way he’d be leaving before the Super Bowl.
A few minutes later, though, her tone changes and she seems on the verge of tears.
And though the title of her book, “Hats and Eyeglasses,” is an old gambling expression for a dreadful run at the table, Ms. Frankel’s childhood memories are happy ones, in which gambling equaled friendship equaled food equaled laughter equaled love.
They bet on everything, from sports to how much her mother would lose at Weight Watchers.
At the University of Miami, she had a brief marriage to a classmate who bet on sports games and was dealing cocaine.
Her Web site, marthafrankel.com, shows pictures of her with her arms around her subjects, and many of the stories were the genial “tell us who you most loved working with” sort, but not all.
“Stan was alive then,” Ms. Frankel says.
“I wouldn’t have done it if he had died.” She reconsiders.
“No, I would have.
I just didn’t like her.
Ms. Frankel was flying to Europe, bringing in $3,500 to $4,000 a profile and making about $80,000 a year.
She remembers that she usually made money, but she was becoming obsessed with the game.

“Before ’95, I never turned down an assignment,” Ms. Frankel says.
“If the money was good enough, I’d interview Adolf Hitler and make him sound very fascinating: I’m a ho.
But when I started playing poker, I started turning down stories.
She lost from Day 1, but she could not stop.

“It was almost like a chemical change in me,” she says.
“I always heard crack cocaine was so different from cocaine — it has this thing that immediately hooks you.
It was faster, Ms. Frankel says.
In an amateur game, perhaps 18 hands would be dealt an hour; in the casinos it might be 30, but online it could be 60.
She could not make enough money to pay off her losses, so they were mounting.
“Every day this was my prayer — probably this is the prayer of every addict: Please let me stop today, please let today be the day,” she says.
“I had no idea what would make me stop.
Then one day her mother called, crying.
“She was hysterical,” Ms. Frankel says.
“She kept asking what she had done to make me so angry.” Her voice clutches up.
Her husband was infuriated, she writes.
Ms. Frankel’s lifestyle today hardly resembles Gamblers Anonymous recovery: though she long ago deleted the poker site from her computer, she still plays poker once a week with friends.
Has she also gone to casinos?
“Many times,” she says.
“It feels like a totally different thing.”
Some would call this denial.
“I don’t think I’m in denial,” Ms. Frankel says.
“Gambling barely affects my life.
I know recovering heroin addicts who drink.
I play poker.”
“I only play for what I can afford,” she adds.
“It might not suit everyone, but it’s impossible to think one thing suits everyone.”
A few days later, the reporter calls back with a question she had forgotten: When did Ms. Frankel finally tell her husband how much she lost?
The night after the reporter left, Ms. Frankel says.
The economic news has been fairly dire this week.
The credit crunch is getting worse, and a widely watched indicator of trends in the service sector — which is most of the economy — has fallen off a cliff.
It’s still not a certainty that we’re headed into recession, but the odds are growing greater.
And if past experience is any guide, the troubles will persist for a long time — say, into the middle of 2010.
The problems now facing the U.S. economy look a lot like the problems that caused the last two recessions — but this time in combination.
On one side, the bursting of the housing bubble is playing the role that the bursting of the dot-com bubble played in 2001.
On the other, the subprime crisis is creating a credit crunch reminiscent of the crunch after the savings-and-loan crisis of the late 1980s, which led to recession in 1990.
Now, you may have heard that those recessions were short.
And it’s true that the last two recessions both officially ended after only eight months.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But the official end dates for those recessions are deeply misleading, at least as far as most peoples’ experience is concerned.
There’s a reason that the Bush administration, in its (increasingly strained) efforts to tout economic performance on its watch, always talks about jobs added since August 2003.
Since the current problems of the U.S. economy look like a combination of 1990 and 2001, the shape of this episode of economic distress will probably be similar to that of the earlier episodes: even if the official recession is short, the bad times will linger well into the next administration.
How severe will the distress be?
The double-bubble nature of the underlying problem — a housing bubble and a credit bubble combined — suggests that it may well be worse than either 1990 or 2001.

And some highly respected economists are issuing dire warnings.
There has been a lot of buzz about a new paper by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that compares the United States in recent years to other advanced countries that have experienced financial crises.
They find that the U.S. profile resembles that of the “big five crises,” a list that includes, for example, Sweden’s 1991 crisis, which caused the unemployment rate to soar from 2 percent to 9 percent over a two-year period.
Maybe we’ll be lucky, and that won’t happen.
But what can be done to limit the damage?
Since September, the Federal Reserve has slashed its target interest rate five times, and everyone expects it to cut further.

Meanwhile, Congress and the Bush administration have reached agreement on a much-hyped stimulus package.
But the package, while probably better than nothing, is unlikely to make a noticeable dent in the problem — in part because the insistence of the administration and Senate Republicans on blocking precisely the measures, such as expanded unemployment insurance and food stamps, that are most likely to be effective.
Still, by January the White House will have a new occupant.
If the slump is still going on, which is likely, this will offer a chance to consider other, more effective measures.
In particular, now would be a good time to think about the possibility of going beyond tax cuts and rebate checks, and stimulating the economy with some much-needed public investment — say, in repairing the country’s crumbling infrastructure.

The usual rap against public spending as a form of economic stimulus is that it takes too long to get going — that by the time the money starts flowing, the recession is already over.
But if this turns out to be a prolonged slump, which seems likely, that won’t be a problem.
But we won’t get any innovative action to help the economy unless the next president has a couple of key attributes.
First, he or she has to be free of the ideological blinders that make the current administration and its allies fiercely oppose the idea that the government can do anything positive aside from cutting taxes.
Second, he or she has to be knowledgeable about and interested in economic policy.
Presidents don’t have to be their own chief economists, but they do need to know enough to take the right advice.
Will we have that kind of president?
What can borrowers do to extricate themselves?
If belt-tightening suffices, one option is a debt management repayment plan in which interest rates, but not balances, are reduced.

Ronald J. Mann, a law professor at Columbia University and a credit expert, describes credit industry practices as intended to enslave borrowers in a “sweat box.” He recommends a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that wipes out most credit card debt.
Many consumers, however, are loath to file for bankruptcy protection, said Mark S. Zuckerberg, a bankruptcy lawyer in Indianapolis.
And others may find that they cannot qualify for a Chapter 7.
Then there is debt settlement, when a debtor and creditor agree that payment of a negotiated, reduced balance will be payment in full.
Debt settlement generally works best when consumers can offer a lump sum, the experts said.
But consumers may face taxes on the amount the creditor has forgiven.
“Done correctly, it can absolutely help people,” said Cyndi Geerdes, an associate professor at the University of Illinois law school who also runs a consumer debt clinic.
Consumers can arrange debt settlement themselves, and many Web sites offer advice.
Consumers can also hire a lawyer or use debt settlement companies, many of which advertise online and on television.
The experts agree, however, that “buyer beware” is the best advice when considering debt settlement companies.
A thousand such companies exist nationwide, up from about 300 a couple of years ago, estimated David Leuthold, vice president of the Association of Settlement Companies, which has 70 members and is based in Madison, Wis.
Deanne Loonin, a senior lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center in Boston, has investigated them.
“It’s possible there are honest ones,” she said, “but I assume they aren’t until proven otherwise.”
Travis Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America in Washington, said distressed borrowers who cannot produce lump sums to settle with creditors were the most vulnerable to dishonest companies.
In some cases, these companies tell consumers to stop paying monthly minimums, explaining that they will negotiate a settlement when borrowers have saved enough.
Meanwhile, they take hefty monthly fees directly from clients’ bank accounts.

Creditors will not negotiate reduced balances with consumers who are still making monthly payments.
But when they stop paying, total balances swell with fees and interest rates.
And depending on the law in states where debtors live, creditors can attach wages and property to satisfy the new total owed.
“Many debt settlement companies never explain these risks clearly,” said Joseph A. Mullaney, a consumer affairs lawyer in Voorhees, N.J.

According to Ms. Geerdes, whether a creditor takes legal steps depends on its analysis of each debtor.
And his members must pledge to inform clients of risks and spell them out in contracts, he said.
David Johnson, senior vice president of ByDesign Financial Solutions, a nonprofit charity in Commerce, Calif., says he advises consumers to avoid companies that charge large fees upfront or through payments.

“It certainly would seem likely that there would be less incentive to push to settle quickly,” Mr. Johnson wrote in an e-mail message.
He recommended that consumers look for services that charge after settlement, about 20 percent of the amount of the negotiated reduction in balance.
Desperate consumers may turn to debt settlement, Mr. Mullaney says, because “they usually want to pay their debt” but are also “intrigued with the proposition of getting out of it without the dishonor of declaring bankruptcy and with the prospect of compromising the actual principal that they owe.”
And company employees can be smooth talkers, said Susan Block-Lieb, a law professor at Fordham University and a consumer affairs expert.
“You’ve got these really convincing, calm people with a really complicated formula, who are saying, ‘Don’t worry.’ ”
Katherine Taylor, the maiden name of a white-collar worker in Austin, Tex., who did not want to be further identified because she is a supervisor, said she realized last summer that she and her husband would soon be unable to make monthly minimums on their $59,000 in credit card debt.

On the first phone call with one based in Austin, she agreed to let the company take $676 from her bank account for five months, then $416 for the next 13.
Late last year, unable to reach the settlement company by phone and getting constant calls from collectors, Ms. Taylor contacted a local Better Business Bureau office.
Offered a partial refund by the service, she is considering her options.
“I’ve found redemption, through using my legal degree and what I’ve gone through, in counseling others who sit before me ashamed and in tears,” he said.
Marc S. Stern, a bankruptcy lawyer in Seattle, said most consumers should not negotiate for themselves.
“It’s too emotional, and a lawyer can say things about clients that they never will, like he’s a deadbeat and you’re never going to get any more from him,” Mr. Stern said.
Experts agreed that deals may be struck with many original creditors for 50 to 80 cents on the dollar, while debt buyers, who paid 20 cents or less on the dollar, may settle for a lower amount.
Debt settlement companies are regulated by state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission, but they are rarely prosecuted.
To improve regulation of this interstate business, the Uniform Law Commission, sponsored by state governments and based in Chicago, is promoting a model law that covers credit counseling and debt management companies.
Mr. Leuthold says his association welcomes regulation but has reservations about the model law, including its volume.
“Some say it is long and complicated, 80 pages, and a lot of states don’t want that level of detail,” he said.

Until the states or Congress act, credit card holders are “naked in the world,” said Elizabeth Warren, a law professor at Harvard and a bankruptcy expert.
“Unscrupulous debt counselors have built their business models around taking advantage of desperate people.”
AVERAGE apartment sale prices in Manhattan soared last month to the highest levels ever, showing the tenacity and power of the luxury market.
With at least 15 closings at the expensive new condominiums at 15 Central Park West, and a steady stream of sales at the most exclusive co-ops, including a record-setting $46 million sale on Fifth Avenue, the average apartment sold for nearly $1.75 million, according to a compilation of preliminary industry statistics.
Yet, despite the continuing euphoria in the luxury market, there were signs that the rest of the market was in a holding pattern.
Median prices reflect the broader market without the influence of the mega-sales.
Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at two brokerage firms, Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, says the pace of sales at the upper reaches of the market was set by the availability of trophy apartments that rarely change hands, while buyers in the rest of the market are “more sensitive to what is going on in the economy and with interest rates.”

“Many want to sit on the fence and wait,” he said.
“Some people have the misconception that we have the same inventory here as in the rest of the country, and it is not even close.”
The big transactions last month included the $46 million sale of a co-op apartment at 1060 Fifth Avenue, at 87th Street, to Scott A. Bommer, a hedge fund manager.
A $32 million duplex at 740 Park Avenue, near 71st Street, sold to D. Randall Winn, the managing director of Capital IQ, a division of Standard & Poor’s that provides financial analysis tools, and his wife, Tamara Winn.
She is a daughter of Ira Rennert, the billionaire investor who is sometimes credited with having the world’s largest home, in the Hamptons.
That apartment is now back on the market with a $24 million asking price.
As long as home prices were rising, these borrowers could refinance their loans or sell their properties to pay off their mortgages.
But now, with prices falling and lenders clamping down, homeowners with solid credit are starting to come under the same financial stress as those with subprime credit.
The running turmoil is also stirring fears that some hedge funds may run into trouble.
At the end of September, nearly 4 percent of prime mortgages were past due or in foreclosure, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The delinquency and foreclosure rate for all mortgages, 7.3 percent, is higher than at any time since the group started tracking that data in 1979, largely as a result of the surge in subprime lending during the last few years.
An example of the spreading credit crisis is seen in Don Doyle, a computer engineer at Lockheed Martin who makes a six-figure income and had a stellar credit score in 2004, when he refinanced his home in Northern California to take cash out to pay for his daughter’s college tuition.
Mr. Doyle, 52, is now worried that he will have to file for bankruptcy, because he cannot afford to make the higher variable payments on his mortgage, and he cannot sell his home for more than his $740,000 mortgage.
“Now I am caught.
I can’t sell my house.
I’m having a hard time refinancing.
I’ve avoided bankruptcy for months trying to pull this out of my savings.”
The default rate for prime mortgages is still far lower than for subprime loans, about 24 percent of which are delinquent or in foreclosure.
Some economists note that slightly more than a third of American homeowners have paid off their mortgages completely.
This group is generally more affluent and contributes more to consumer spending and the economy relative to its size.

Unlike subprime borrowers, who tend to have lower incomes and fewer assets, prime borrowers have greater means to restructure their debt if they lose jobs or encounter other financial challenges.
The recent reductions in short term interest rates by the Federal Reserve should also help by reducing the reset rate for adjustable loans.
Still, economists say the rate cuts and the $168 billion fiscal stimulus package are unlikely to make a significant dent in the large debts weighing on many Americans, because banks have tightened lending standards and expected rebates from the government will not cover most house payments.
The problems are most acute in areas that experienced a big boom in housing — California, the Southwest, Florida and other coastal markets — and in the Midwest, which is suffering from job losses in the manufacturing sector.
And it is not just first-mortgage default rates that are rising.
About 5.7 percent of home equity lines of credit were delinquent or in default at the end of last year, up from 4.5 percent a year earlier, according to Moody’s Economy.com and Equifax, the credit bureau.
Personal bankruptcy filings, which fell significantly after a 2005 federal law made it harder to wipe out debts in bankruptcy, are starting to inch up.
The so-called charge-off rate is still lower than before the 2005 law went into effect.
Banks are responding to the rise in delinquencies by capping home equity lines of credit in areas with falling real estate prices.
A few credit card companies have also moved to reduce the credit limits of customers they deem more risky.

Bank of America, Citigroup, Countrywide Financial, JPMorgan Chase, Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo are expected to announce on Tuesday at the Treasury Department that they will offer both prime and subprime borrowers who are more than three months behind a chance to halt foreclosure proceedings for 30 days and work out new loan terms.
In a conference call with analysts in December, Kenneth Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, said more borrowers appear to be giving up on their homes as prices fall, noting a “change in social attitudes toward default.”

“You don’t mind making a $2,000 payment when the house is going up” in value, said Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Scottsdale, Arizona, who has seen several clients walk away from their homes because they couldn’t refinance or sell.
“When it’s going down, it becomes a weight around your neck, it becomes an anchor.”
Home prices in the North Las Vegas neighborhood of Brenda Harris, a technology analyst at a casino company, have fallen 20 percent to 30 percent.
The builder who sold her a new three-bedroom home on Pink Flamingos Place for about $392,000 in 2006 is now listing similar properties for $314,000.
But Ms. Harris does not want to leave her home.
She estimates that she has spent close to $40,000 on her property, about half for a down payment and much of the rest on a deck and landscaping.
“I’m not behind in my payments, but I’m trying to prevent getting behind,” Ms. Harris said.
“I don’t want to ruin my credit.”
In addition to the declining value of her home, Ms. Harris, 53, will soon be hit with a sharply higher house payment.
She has an option adjustable-rate mortgage, a loan that allows borrowers to pay less than the interest and principal due every month.
The unpaid interest gets added to the principal balance.
She is making the minimum monthly payments due on her loan, about $2,400.
But she knows she will not be able to pay the $3,400 needed to cover her interest and principal, which she will be required to pay once her loan balance reaches 115 percent of her starting balance.
At the time, she asked for a loan that could be refinanced after one year without penalty.
A nonprofit community group, Acorn Housing, is trying to broker a modification of Ms. Harris’s loan.

Credit counselors say many borrowers like Ms. Harris were cajoled or pushed into risky mortgages that they never had the ability to repay.
“I’d say, Let me tell you something, this is crazy,” Mr. Brenner said.
“You cannot afford this house, even if nothing happens and rates stay as low as they are today.
And the response would be: I don’t care.”
Lenders extended credit to people without verifying their incomes and allowing them to make little or no down payments.
But borrowers like Mr. Doyle, the engineer in Northern California, say they are victims of their circumstances — housing prices collapsed and lending standards tightened just as they needed to sell or refinance.
In refinancing their home in 2004, Mr. Doyle and his wife were doing what millions of other homeowners did in the last decade — tapping into the rising value of their homes for home improvements, paying off credit card debt, college tuition and for other spending.
Until their most recent loan they never had a problem making their payments.
Still, Mr. Doyle does not regret refinancing in 2004.
Another Fed rate cut might unfreeze credit markets and give consumers access to somewhat cheaper loans, but there’s no going back to the easy money of a few years ago.
Lenders and borrowers have been badly burned, and the values of houses and other assets are dropping faster than interest rates can be lowered.

The underlying problem has been building for decades.
America’s median hourly wage is barely higher than it was 35 years ago, adjusted for inflation.
The income of a man in his 30s is now 12 percent below that of a man his age three decades ago.
Most of what’s been earned in America since then has gone to the richest 5 percent.
Yet the rich devote a smaller percentage of their earnings to buying things than the rest of us because, after all, they’re rich.
They already have most of what they want.
Instead of buying, and thus stimulating the American economy, the rich are more likely to invest their earnings wherever around the world they can get the highest return.
The problem has been masked for years as middle- and lower-income Americans found ways to live beyond their paychecks.
But now they have run out of ways.
The percentage of American working mothers with school-age children has almost doubled since 1970 — to more than 70 percent.
But there’s a limit to how many mothers can maintain paying jobs.

So Americans turned to a second way of spending beyond their hourly wages.
The typical American now works more each year than he or she did three decades ago.
Americans became veritable workaholics, putting in 350 more hours a year than the average European, more even than the notoriously industrious Japanese.
But there’s also a limit to how many hours Americans can put into work, so Americans turned to a third way of spending beyond their wages.
With housing prices rising briskly through the 1990s and even faster from 2002 to 2006, they turned their homes into piggy banks by refinancing home mortgages and taking out home-equity loans.
With the bursting of the housing bubble, the piggy banks are closing.
The binge seems to be over.
We’re finally reaping the whirlwind of widening inequality and ever more concentrated wealth.

The only way to keep the economy going over the long run is to increase the wages of the bottom two-thirds of Americans.
The answer is not to protect jobs through trade protection.
That would only drive up the prices of everything purchased from abroad.
Most routine jobs are being automated anyway.
A larger earned-income tax credit, financed by a higher marginal income tax on top earners, is required.
The tax credit functions like a reverse income tax.
Enlarging it would mean giving workers at the bottom a bigger wage supplement, as well as phasing it out at a higher wage.
The current supplement for a worker with two children who earns up to $16,000 a year is about $5,000.
That amount declines as earnings increase and is eliminated at about $38,000.
It should be increased to, say, $8,000 at the low end and phased out at an income of $46,000.

We also need stronger unions, especially in the local service sector that’s sheltered from global competition.
Employees should be able to form a union without the current protracted certification process that gives employers too much opportunity to intimidate or coerce them.
Workers should be able to decide whether to form a union with a simple majority vote.
And employers who fire workers for trying to organize should have to pay substantial fines.
Right now, the typical penalty is back pay for the worker, plus interest — a slap on the wrist.
Over the longer term, inequality can be reversed only through better schools for children in lower- and moderate-income communities.
This will require, at the least, good preschools, fewer students per classroom and better pay for teachers in such schools, in order to attract the teaching talent these students need.
These measures are necessary to give Americans enough buying power to keep the American economy going.
They are also needed to overcome widening inequality, and thereby keep America in one piece.
People complain that they have failed to deliver on their promises, that they have proved just as corrupt as other politicians and that they have presided over a worsening of security, demonstrated most vividly in a rising number of suicide attacks carried out by militants based in the nearby tribal areas.
The shift in mood here may be a bellwether of larger trends nationwide.
The religious parties held 59 seats in the 342-member Parliament, making them a kingmaker at critical times, like helping President Pervez Musharraf to extend his military rule.
But this time their number may fall to single digits, according to some estimates.
Pollsters and political analysts in Pakistan have maintained that the religious parties command only a small percentage of popular support and that the 2002 elections were an aberration, a reaction to the American intervention in Afghanistan and the result of rigging by Pakistan’s intelligence agencies, which have always had links with the religious parties.
Two opinion polls released this week show that the standing of the religious parties has fallen to a new low, with voters showing a strong shift of support toward the moderate parties.
A survey of more than 3,000 people at the end of January by the International Republican Institute showed that the religious parties could command only 1 percent of the vote nationally, down from 4 percent in November.
Meanwhile, support for the Pakistan Peoples Party, the party of the assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, has soared to 50 percent nationally, the poll found.
The face-to-face survey was conducted throughout Pakistan and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.
Another survey conducted by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based bipartisan group that seeks to reduce support for international terrorism, showed backing at 62 percent for the Pakistan Peoples Party and the faction of the Pakistan Muslim League led by the opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif.

If the Taliban were on the ballot sheet, they would garner just 3 percent of the vote, and Al Qaeda only 1 percent, according to the poll.
The face-to-face nationwide survey of more than 1,000 interviews was conducted in January with D3 Systems and the Pakistan Institute for Public Opinion and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Here in North-West Frontier Province, where religious parties won a majority and ran the government, they are blamed for being soft on the militants and for allowing “Talibanization,” the radical Islamist agenda creeping into society.

“People are fed up because they are not opposing the attacks by the Taliban openly,” said Muhammad Jawed, 40, a businessman who attended the funeral for Mr. Muhammad’s son.
That frustration has redounded to the favor of moderate opposition parties like the Awami National Party, a Pashtun nationalist party founded by Mr. Wali’s grandfather.
It is now hoping to triple that on Monday and to secure as many as 12 national assembly seats.
The religious coalition itself is in disarray, facing attacks from both left and right.
One of the largest parties in the coalition, Jamaat-e-Islami, is boycotting the elections, protesting what it says is an uneven playing field provided by Mr. Musharraf.
The other main party in the coalition, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, is split, tainted after its leader, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, made compromises to support Mr. Musharraf.
Today, Maulana Rehman is homebound, under threat from the militants who resent the support he has lent to Mr. Musharraf.
His house has come under attack, and he is under threat from suicide attacks, government officials have said.
For Mr. Wali, the expected trouncing of the religious parties on Monday is recompense.
“I feel,” he said, “that we Pashtuns have had enough of war, enough of bloodshed, and the common man now accepts that.”
I know that sounds dramatic.
Like many of the financial innovations that are now being called into question, auction-rate securities are complicated deals that seemed to offer something for nothing.

They seemed to offer the borrowers — typically local governments or quasi-governmental agencies, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Michigan Higher Education Student Loan Authority — a way to borrow long term without paying the relatively high interest rates investors usually demand on long-term loans.
The operative word in all of this, of course, is “seemed.”
Auction-rate securities seemed as good as cash because they involve regular, well, auctions, held as often as once a week, in which investors wanting out sell their positions to investors wanting in.
In principle, it was always possible for auctions to fail for lack of enough willing buyers — but that wasn’t ever supposed to happen.

Meanwhile, these securities seemed like a good deal for borrowers despite the fact that they contain a penalty clause: if an auction fails, the interest rate the borrower pays jumps up.
You see, there weren’t ever supposed to be failed auctions, so the penalties weren’t supposed to be relevant.
Now, what wasn’t ever supposed to happen has.
In the last few weeks, a series of auctions have failed, leaving investors who thought they had ready access to their cash stuck, even as borrowers find themselves paying penalty rates.
The collapse of the auction-rate security market doesn’t reflect newly discovered problems with the borrowers: the Port Authority is as financially sound today as it was a month ago.
Instead, it’s contagion from the broader credit crisis.

One channel of contagion involves monoline bond insurers, the specialized insurance companies that are supposed to guarantee debt.
These companies insured buyers of local government debt against losses — but they also guaranteed a lot of subprime-related investments, which makes everyone wonder whether they’ll actually have the money to compensate losers in other markets.
More important, however, is the way the ever-widening financial crisis has shaken investors’ faith in the whole system.
People no longer trust assurances that fancy financial instruments will function the way they’re supposed to — after all, they know what happened to people who thought their subprime-backed securities were safe, AAA-rated investments.
Why, then, should they believe that auction-rate securities are as good as cash?
And loss of trust can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Now that new investors won’t buy auction-rate securities because they no longer believe that they’re as good as cash, those securities become a much worse investment.

Needless to say, all of this is bad for the economy.
I like to think of what’s happening as a sort of minor-key reprise of the banking crisis that swept America in 1930 and 1931.
Frustrated investors who can’t get their money out of auction-rate securities aren’t as photogenic as angry mobs milling outside closed banks, but the principle is the same.
And so are the effects: would-be borrowers can’t get credit, and the economy suffers.
One simple measure of the seriousness of the credit problem is this: although the Federal Reserve has sharply cut the interest rate it controls over the past few weeks, the borrowing costs facing many companies and households have actually gone up.
And the financial contagion is still spreading.
What market is next?
“The reports didn’t seem to confirm recession, but they confirmed slow growth,” said Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America.
“Given what was happening in the financial markets this week, the vibes aren’t that good.”
Import costs grew last month at the highest annual rate since the Labor Department began keeping records in 1983, primarily because of surging oil costs.
The high price of gasoline is putting pressure on Americans to cut back on nonessential purchases.

“This is just horrible,” Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note.
“The sustained volatility in the markets, the rise in energy and food prices and, of course, the catastrophe in the housing market, is making consumers extraordinarily miserable.”
A closely watched measure of consumer confidence, the Reuters/University of Michigan survey, fell to 69.6 in February, the lowest reading since February 1992.
“Companies are responding remarkably rapidly to signs of weakness by cutting their production and cutting back on hiring,” said Edward E. Yardeni, an investment strategist.
“If we’re not careful we may push ourselves into a recession.”

The slowdown in growth is likely to result in further cuts to the Fed’s benchmark interest rate, which central bankers have already lowered by 1.25 percentage points this year.
But the rise in import prices underscores concerns that inflation might also be posing a problem, a development that could complicate the Fed’s rate-cutting decisions.
Lower interest rates stimulate growth by easing the flow of money among banks, consumers and businesses.
But they can also lead to higher prices and a weaker dollar.
Fuel, food and beverage costs led the rise, with the cost of imported petroleum up 67 percent from January 2007, according to the Labor Department.
The higher costs may partly explain the slowdown in import sales, which are lagging even as sales of exports surge.
Cold weather pushed up activity at electric and natural gas utilities, which offset a sharp decline in output at auto manufacturers.

Capacity utilization, which measures the proportion of plants in use, held steady in January at 81.5 percent.

“Everywhere else, including technology equipment, was still pretty good.”
But manufacturers have been hit hard.
A sharp drop in orders and payrolls led the decline, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
And analysts forecast more headwinds.
“An increasingly constrained consumer, deepening woes for the housing sector and no desire to build inventories will all weigh on manufacturing output, which we expect to remain weak for some time,” wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm.
But despite the conventional wisdom, the rental market has been showing strength.
Since two high-end rental buildings opened within a block of each other in Jersey City in late September, for example, more than 750 of their apartments have been leased.
The buildings, 50 Columbus and Grove Pointe, are next to a PATH train station, but well inland from the river; their rents start at $1,900 for a studio.

Such indications would seem to be bad news for the Peninsula at City Place in Edgewater, where developers converted a three-building rental complex to condominiums a year ago.
“People kept coming in and asking for rentals,” Mr. Anthony said.
“But buyer traffic went from 30 people a week down to the teens, or even less.”
Yet since mid-January things have changed again; an average of 40 potential buyers show up per week, Mr. Anthony said.
“I think there is a perception that there is a floor in the market — and we hit it, or have come very very close,” he said.
“With the recent compression of federal interest rates, and the trickle-down to mortgage rates, people are seeing ‘cheap money,’ and the desire to own is resilient.”
But one technique that may have encouraged that desire at Peninsula (a technique also applied at several other slow-selling condo projects) is a “rent to buy” program that went into effect last month.
It is drawing in buyers “like honey,” Mr. Anthony said.
The complex has 160 units; 60 have sold so far.
But prospective buyers now have a couple of extra possibilities to consider.
One is to rent with an option for purchase after a year.
If the option is exercised at that point, the 12 months already paid in rent serve as a down payment on a mortgage.
The other possibility, called rent-to-own, involves signing a purchase agreement at the same time as a year’s lease, with the purchase price and maximum mortgage interest rate locked in.
Mr. Anthony said that the former option seems to be appealing to Manhattanites wary of the move across the river, who want to try out life in New Jersey before committing.
“There really is no catch, no negative, to programs like that,” said Shaun Osher of CORE Group Marketing, which does sales promotion for both condo and rental projects.
“It takes away the uncertainty for a buyer.”

Mr. Osher added that while renting is “appealing,” he believes that “ultimately, if one is planning to be in a property for more than two years, with interest rates being what they are, buying is still the way to go.”
The mortgage tax deduction on federal income taxes continues to be a tipping factor, he added.
At Dixon Mills, a condo conversion project in Jersey City that offers mostly one- and two-bedroom units, Jon Ha, the sales manager, detailed the scenario he typically presents to prospective buyers: A one-bedroom unit at the complex is priced at $329,000.
With a 20 percent down payment, and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with 5.5 percent interest on the remaining $263,200, the monthly payment — including property tax and common charges — is $3,025.
But when the tax savings on the mortgage deduction is figured in, the net payment is $1,869.
“This is less — to own a one-bedroom — than to rent a studio at 50 Columbus or Grove Pointe,” he said.

For those now contending with Manhattan prices, it’s a bargain either way, of course.
His friends in Manhattan, meanwhile, are incredulous at the “deal” he got on his two-bedroom condo in New Jersey.
At a new development in Rahway adjacent to a transit center, 35 condos are priced from $315,000, and the developers are advertising a mortgage program that could make mortgage payments as low as $1,770.
(The estimate, which is on a 30-year Wells Fargo Bank mortgage with a fixed interest rate of 5.987, requiring a 5 percent down payment, does not include property taxes.)
“Well, when you see the deals being offered,” Mr. Otteau said, “it’s pretty clear developers really want to sell these condos and woo people away from rental.”
In the longer run, however, he is predicting that demand for rental housing will increase faster than for home purchases.
“New Jersey’s population density of 1,150 persons per square mile is the highest in the world, even greater than Japan, 850 persons, and India, 950,” he said.
This intensifies demand for housing, which leads to higher cost; currently, housing in New Jersey costs 53 percent above the national average, he said.
And if prices in New York remain where they are or go higher, that number is likely to increase.
The net effect will be to force more people out of the home purchase market — and into the rental market.
If at first you don’t succeed … go back to Wisconsin.
Or something like that.
The weather aside, Julie Bosman and Jeff Zeleny of The New York Times report that some Wisconsin voters are disappointed more national attention isn’t being paid to them.
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have spent some of the week ahead of the state’s primary away from Wisconsin as they think ahead to contests in Ohio and Texas.
“The campaign has been intense elsewhere in the country, but I don’t feel like it’s been intense here,” said Susan Lund, a legal secretary from Whitefish Bay, a suburb of Milwaukee.
Both of the top Democrats are seeking Mr. Edwards’s endorsement.
Mr. Huckabee, the G.O.P.
Mr. Huckabee turned the occasion into an opportunity to point out that his chief rival for the Republican presidential nomination, John McCain of Arizona, and the two Democrats seeking their party’s nomination are senators and that unlike them, he did not receive a taxpayer-financed salary while campaigning.
“No taxpayers pay for me to have health insurance, to pay my mortgage, to pay my bills,” Mr. Huckabee said.
“And so to me, it’s not just absurd, it’s beyond absurd — it’s insulting — to think that there’s something nefarious about my being here when nobody has raised the question about sitting U.S. senators taking their full paycheck and enjoying all the magnificent perks they get from the U.S. taxpayers.”
The top strategists for John McCain, the likely Republican nominee for president, over the weekend struggled with the issue of the current president.
But even as the consensus was that Mr. McCain needed to “stand in the sun” on his own, as one adviser put it, without the large shadow cast by Mr. Bush, left unsaid was the difficult calculus the McCain campaign faces: Using Mr. Bush enough to try to make the tough sell of Mr. McCain to conservatives but not so much that he will drive away the independents and some moderate Democrats that Mr. McCain is counting on in November.
Echoing former President George H. W. Bush, who is set to endorse Mr. McCain in Houston today, Mr. McCain said Americans would see “no new taxes” during his presidency, reports the Associated Press.
McCain told ABC’s “This Week” that under no circumstances would he increase taxes, and added that he could “see an argument, if our economy continues to deteriorate, for lower interest rates, lower tax rates, and certainly decreasing corporate tax rates,” as well as giving people the ability to write off depreciation and eliminating the alternative minimum tax.
The Wall Street Journal says the Democrats “have ratcheted up their antitrade, anticorporate rhetoric,” and are attacking those same corporate tax cuts that wouldn’t be out of the question under a McCain presidency.
In the New Yorker magazine, Ryan Lizza looks at Senator McCain’s campaign from his bus.
Looking ahead to the March 4 primary-caucus in Texas, Dan Balz of The Washington Post writes that Mrs. Clinton’s infrastructure there will be difficult for Mr. Obama to match.
In Texas, Obama cannot replicate Clinton’s affinity overnight.
His advisers believe they can overcome many of her built-in advantages, enough at least to emerge with a close split in delegates under the state’s convoluted primary-caucus system, by tapping into a new generation of Texans who have no connections to the Clintons and by arguing that the senator from Illinois would be the stronger general-election candidate.
But as was the case in the run-up to Super Tuesday, his advisers say he will be in a race against the clock.
Referring to a former Texas governor, he said: “They have good ties to the Ann Richards liberals.
They have good ties to labor in Houston.
Good ties to some of the Democratic money in Dallas.
Good ties traditionally to the African American community — though it won’t be as helpful — and good ties to the Latino community.”
Mr. Obama is doing what he can down there, reports The Los Angeles Times, including opening an office in Brownsville, Tex., half a mile from the Mexican border.
The grand opening celebration drew about 200 supporters, “a noteworthy crowd, the campaign said, for an event not attended by the candidate.”
Now, the Obama strategy is to peel away as much of that base as possible, helping him to either win Ohio and Texas outright or at least split the states’ delegations to the national nominating convention.
“We’re finding people who were Clinton supporters and making them Obama supporters.”
The Washington Post also looks at the specifics of that unusual primary-caucus system Texas uses to determine which candidate gets its delegates.
The bizarre process could be a boon to the Obama campaign.
What Clinton aides discovered is that in certain targeted districts, such as Democratic state Sen. Juan Hinojosa’s heavily Hispanic Senate district in the Rio Grande Valley, Clinton could win an overwhelming majority of votes but gain only a small edge in delegates.
At the same time, a win in the more urban districts in Dallas and Houston — where Sen. Barack Obama expects to receive significant support — could yield three or four times as many delegates.
“What it means is, she could win the popular vote and still lose the race for delegates,” Hinojosa said yesterday.
“This system does not necessarily represent the opinions of the population, and that is a serious problem.”
In another strange aspect of the nominating process, Washington State is holding its primary on Tuesday — although it already held a caucus and awarded Barack Obama the majority of its delegates.
Mr. Obama, known for his sweeping speeches, has used lines once uttered by Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts and an Obama supporter.
They share a world view,” Mr. Axelrod said.
“Both of them are effective speakers whose words tend to get requoted and arguments tend to be embraced widely.”
Newsweek weighs in with its profile of Michelle Obama, known by some as “the rock” in a lengthy article that explores her role in the campaign.

The Fed’s outlook helped propel the stock market higher on the expectation that the central bank’s more dismal outlook for the economy would lead to further interest rate cuts aimed at reviving growth.
Certainly inflation is nowhere near the double-digit rates of the late 1970s, and many economists agree with Fed officials that inflation will cool as the economy slows.
But the combination of rising prices and stalling growth, aggravated by the deepening downturn in housing and credit markets, has put the Fed in a box of its own making.
On one hand, officials are cutting interest rates in order to keep the economy growing at a time when oil prices are surging, credit is tightening and major financial institutions are shell-shocked from the housing and mortgage busts.
On the other, the fear of rising inflation makes it more difficult for Fed officials to jolt the economy with another wave of cheap money.
Lower interest rates have already pushed down the value of the dollar, which in turn prompted oil-producing countries to push for higher oil prices.
“They are walking a very fine line right now,” said Stephen G. Cecchetti, a professor at Brandeis International Business School.
“They are trying to maintain their low-inflation credibility at the same time they are dramatically cutting interest rates.
The facts are that growth is falling quickly, and that inflation is high and rising.”
Nowhere have the Fed’s limitations been more apparent than in the home mortgage market.

“What’s disturbing and scary is that the Fed is doing all the right things — cutting rates, and saying they’ll do more — but it’s not doing anything,” said Michael Menatian, president of Sanborn Mortgage, based in West Hartford, Conn. “We have hundreds of customers who want to refinance, but they’re locked out.”

Fed officials do not see themselves as powerless.
The central bank stunned investors by reducing rates twice in January, once at an unscheduled emergency meeting on Jan. 22 and again at a scheduled policy meeting on Jan. 30.
According to minutes of both meetings, released on Wednesday along with policy makers’ latest economic projections, Fed officials were increasingly worried that plunging confidence in financial markets would lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy of tighter credit conditions, stalled activity in the broader economy and even more fear in financial markets.
Fed policy makers, according to the minutes, noted that credit was becoming harder to get for both consumers and businesses and that financial institutions were vulnerable to more economic weakness after booking huge losses on mortgage-backed securities.
“Some noted the especially worrisome possibility of an adverse feedback loop, that is, a situation in which a tightening of credit conditions could depress investment and consumer spending, which in turn could feed back to a further tightening of credit conditions,” the central bank said in its summary of the discussion.
But at least some Fed policy makers were also worried about rising inflation.
The new Fed forecast, a compilation of the individual projections by Fed governors and the presidents of the regional Fed banks, anticipates that inflation will slow down in response to slower economic growth and that consumer prices will rise, from 2.1 percent to 2.4 percent this year.
“As had been the case in previous cyclical episodes, a relatively low real Federal funds rate now appeared appropriate for a time to counter the factors that were restraining growth, including the slide in housing activity and prices, the tightening of credit availability and the drop in equity prices,” the summary recounted.
“All this sets the stage for a difficult dilemma for the Fed,” Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm in Princeton, N.J., wrote in a report to clients.
“The only sure way the central bank can keep inflation expectations subdued is to tighten monetary policy and raise interest rates until investors, employees and business leaders are convinced that prices will remain low and stable.”
But Mr. Baumohl predicted that inflation would indeed moderate as Fed officials hoped, noting that major discount retailers like Wal-Mart had already reduced prices in anticipation of lower consumer spending.
“Pricing power is very limited in this environment,” Mr. Baumohl said in an interview.
“If companies raise prices to keep up with higher costs, they risk losing market share.
And once they lose market share, it becomes very expensive and hellishly difficult to get it back.”
In 1907, Morgan demanded that presidents of New York trust companies — then a type of second-class bank — act together to save one of their own, the Trust Company of America, from a bank run.
In Chicago, the futures market was talking about halting trading in stock index futures because there were not enough stocks trading to know what the futures were worth.
But efforts to organize concerted action this time have been limited.
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has sought to get agreements in two areas — renegotiating mortgages and putting together a fund to deal with one of the early manifestations of the problem, the threatened collapse of odd financial instruments called structured investment vehicles — but there has been no visible effort to deal with the underlying problem.

In part, that may reflect the slow realization of what is at stake.
But that label is far too narrow, and serves to obscure what is at stake.
“Rather ominously, borrowing costs for even the most creditworthy of firms have started to rise,” said Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics in London.
Homeowners who can still get mortgages have seen rates rise in recent weeks, and banks say they are tightening their standards for both credit cards and commercial real estate loans.

“The principal cause for concern today is the paralysis of the credit markets,” Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and an adviser to President Ronald Reagan, wrote in The Wall Street Journal this week.
“The collapse of confidence in credit markets is now preventing that necessary extension of credit.
The decline of credit creation includes not only the banks but also the bond markets, hedge funds, insurance companies and mutual funds.
Securitization, leveraged buyouts and credit insurance have also atrophied.”

The latest area of crisis is one that Morgan would have recognized in 1907.
The major Wall Street houses — from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to Citigroup and Merrill Lynch — have refused to commit capital to the auction-rate market, a market that was supposed to allow investors to sell each week, via an auction that set interest rates.
Now many auctions are failing.
That has left customers unable to sell securities that were supposed to have virtually guaranteed liquidity, and it has left the issuers — who paid fees to the banks to conduct the auctions — paying ridiculously high interest rates.
It’s not easy to get both borrowers and lenders feeling angry and abandoned, but Wall Street has managed the feat.
The failure of buyers to step up may have been rational.
But that is not true with some of the auction-rate securities.
They represent loans to borrowers that by any standard should be deemed good credits.
That lack of action has damaged the reputation of each of the houses, in ways that would have been unthinkable a few months ago.
But the bosses are scared.
They no longer are sure just how adequate their capital is, and they are afraid to commit it while the financial crisis swirls around them.
It is not clear what the Fed or the Treasury could, or should, do now.
The players can no longer be gathered into a single room, and they are regulated in different countries around the world, if they are regulated at all.
Things are far more difficult because many of these markets are unregulated, making it difficult to gauge who is at risk and for how much.
But it is hard to see this ending until something is done to, in Mr. Feldstein’s words, assure “that necessary extension of credit.” Lowering interest rates will not, by itself, do that so long as the banks and investors are too scared to lend money at any rate.
“In a globally complex financial system, will such collective action be possible if the crisis is triggered beyond the reach of any of today’s regulators?” they asked.
So far, it appears the answer is no.
Wall Street staged a turnaround late Friday, shooting higher in the last half-hour of trading after word that a bailout plan for the troubled bond insurer Ambac Financial Group could be announced next week.
Reports shortly before the closing bell that a bailout plan for the Ambac Financial could be announced Monday or Tuesday pushed shares up sharply.
Ambac finished up $1.48, at $10.71.
The market’s turnaround came after nearly two full days of selling.
“With the overall financial crunch we’ve experienced, this brings new confidence in the sector,” said Jim Herrick, manager of equity trading at Baird & Company, referring to Ambac.
Ambac’s proposal includes a plant to split itself in two in a bid to safeguard its top credit ratings and avert losses on securities that it guarantees for big banks.

The reports in recent weeks have raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve will be able to fend off a recession.
There have also been more urgent fears that the United States may be entering a period of stagflation — when stalling growth accompanies rising prices — for the first time since the 1970s.
As occurred Wednesday and again late Friday, investors at times set aside those concerns and snapped up stocks either to cover bets that stocks would fall or because of genuine optimism that officials from the Fed to other parts of the government could help right the economy.

The Fed’s next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for March 18.
Ryan Detrick, strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, said that among the reports next week, investors will be looking to readings on producer prices — a crucial measure of inflation — as well as consumer sentiment.
Mr. Detrick noted that recent consumer confidence figures, which have been weak, added to concerns that hesitant consumers could pare their spending.
In addition, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will be testifying about the economy during two appearances on Capitol Hill.
In corporate news, Merrill Lynch lowered its ratings on the government-sponsored lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to sell, contending the companies face continued headwinds amid the credit crisis.
The software maker Intuit fell $2.74, to $27.05, after posting a 21 percent decline in its second-quarter profit late Thursday.
Here’s a reminder: One of the four directors of “The Gates,” an HBO documentary about that saffron-hued extravaganza in Central Park, has been dead since 1987.
The long gestation of the project says something about the persistence of the artists involved (both the spectacular-makers and the filmmakers), as well as the shift in public mood from the late 1970s to the early 2000s.
(The credited directors of the finished film are the Maysles, Antonio Ferrera and Matthew Prinzing.)
The self-contained first half-hour of the documentary follows the artists’ progress through the bowels of the city’s cultural bureaucracy — from the office of the parks commissioner, Gordon Davis, to hearings before the Cultural Commission, the Manhattan Borough Parks Committee and other groups — ending with Mr. Davis’s rejection of their permit application in 1981.
This intimate, unadorned opening sequence is a fascinating period piece, closer in look and feel to 1970s Maysles projects like “Gimme Shelter” or “Grey Gardens” than to the current film’s glossy final hour.
The notion of “The Gates” is met with indifference, apprehension or outright contempt by politicians and cultural commissars in a city just emerging from a fiscal crisis, and none of them take much trouble to hide their feelings from the camera.
When the elegant Mr. Davis, in his wide tie and tight suit and holding the artists at bay with an ever-present cigarette, smiles and says, “If I make the wrong decision, they’ll come after me,” we know that “The Gates” didn’t have a chance.

After the dispiriting yet entertaining sturm und drang of 1979-81 the documentary leaps ahead more than 20 years, to when Michael R. Bloomberg, an arts enthusiast enjoying a period of post-9/11 mayoral fiat, announces the approval of “The Gates, Central Park, New York, 1979-2005.” The rest of the film, which records the project’s installation and overwhelmingly positive reception, is brighter, gauzier and significantly less involving.
With its tasteful score and pleasant but dull montages of crowds happily narcotized by Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s orange curtains, it becomes just another “Gates” keepsake, to be stashed away next to the poster and the commemorative print.

Tying together the film’s disparate sections are Christo and Jeanne-Claude themselves; their faces age, like visual emblems of the endurance required to bring about “The Gates,” but their combination of righteousness and wonder is a constant.
This combination appears to hurt their cause in the 1980s — as easy as it is now to see the enemies of “The Gates” as tiresome philistines, it’s also clear that the artists were unprepared or unwilling to deal with the strong and genuine feelings about Central Park that their project stirred up.
The art critic Michael Kimmelman, writing in The New York Times about events in the art world in 2005, said that “whether you thought it was ingenious or kitsch,” the project had “caused countless New Yorkers to debate the meaning of art.” In the film Mr. Kimmelman is seen riding in a car in the park with Jeanne-Claude and Christo, nodding noncommittally as Christo, grinning with delight, points out the window and says: “Look at that!
Look at that!
And that!” For the artists, and for the crowds we see walking the park’s paths in the February chill, there is no debate.

But Mr. Begley is no Hollywood operator.
Before he retired in 2004, his day job was as a partner in the white shoe law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, and I’m actually not sure I have ever seen him without a jacket and tie.
His slightly accented English and his manners are so impeccably correct he could double as the butler.
Or a spy.

But on a Sunday night in January, tie firmly in place, Mr. Begley fed a table of eight a groaning platter of bigos, the sauerkraut stew that many consider the national dish of Poland.
As Mr. Begley’s wife, Anka Muhlstein, a French historian and biographer, told me later, bigos is a very forgiving dish.
Once you’ve got a pot of it going, you can add most leftover meats, and the base will incorporate them (not lamb, though, Mr. Begley says; the taste is wrong).
He buys fresh sauerkraut there, which is a revelation compared with the stuff in the bag or the can.
Not at all bitter.
The assortment of meats he uses includes loads of cocktail-size franks (a direct hit for any pigs-in-a-blanket fan, which means everyone I’ve ever met); chunks of kielbasa, bacon and smoked duck; pigs’ knuckles; and ham hocks.

With a pot of coarse grain mustard on the side and boiled potatoes topped with dill, the overall effect is a grown-up’s version of a child’s dinner party: the meat is cut into small pieces so you get the perfect proportion of it and sauerkraut in every bite.
In Mr. Begley’s rendition, both vodka and red wine infuse the dish with flavor.
What I’ve never liked about French choucroute is how weighted down the bed of sauerkraut is with that lineup of sausages on steroids.
Mr. Begley’s version integrates the meats with the sauerkraut in a more subtle way, if sausage and sauerkraut can be subtle.
The first round of bigos disappeared in short order.
I was seated next to Charles Masson, whose family owns La Grenouille (one of the priciest old-school French restaurants in town).
I have encountered him only sporadically through the years, an elegant man who seems to suffer the absurdities of the rich and the entitled with exceptional grace.
My one mistake was saying no to Mr. Begley’s offer to take home leftovers.
But I knew if I accepted I’d be in the kitchen at 2 a.m. downing every scrap.
He invited me back for a lunch of leftovers the next week, assuring me the food would keep (some people freeze bigos; Mr. Begley does not).

I bombarded him with questions about his history with bigos.
Mr. Begley has been making it ever since, here and at his home in the Hamptons.
Laughing aside, I realized he had no intention of engaging in a long, searching chat about his childhood memories.
And truth be told, he didn’t need to.
I have repeatedly had to answer questions about a national idea.
I believe that a debate on this subject is largely ineffective.
But I am sure that each nation should have an understandable set of principles and goals that unite the people living in that country.
And these principles are developed in light of the very real things that society demands.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
What are these principles?
How are they seen today?
They are, above all, freedom and justice.
Secondly, the individual’s civic dignity.
Third, his or her well-being and social responsibility.
We do not need to invent anything in this respect.
The basic values of humanity were first formulated a long time ago, but applying them to the specificities of Russia’s situation has sometimes been a problem.
And the main issue is how to combine, how to ensure that our national tradition reconciles with a fundamental set of democratic values.
This is a challenge that Russia’s political and intellectual elite have struggled with for 150 years.
In addition, today the majority of parties have already talked about the need to observe basic constitutional provisions, the basic rights and freedoms of citizens.
About the fact that a decent life for Russian people can be built only on the basis of an efficiently developing market economy.
Incidentally, hardly anyone believed this 15 years ago that there could be a consensus here, but today we can see a huge consensus on this subject among our citizens.
This is a huge achievement for our country’s development over the past eight years.
I will repeat once again, because it’s an extremely important message: power does not exist for itself but for the effective governance of the country and for the benefit of its citizens.
And it is this model that we need to pursue.
A model, which, in fact, is based on a social contract between the government and society, a contract, which creates reciprocal obligations for the Parties and results in the full responsibility of the authorities to its people.
In constructing such government, responsible to the people, as well in attempts to see the results of its work control must play a leading role.
And non-governmental organizations are the ones who provide that control.
Assisting non-governmental and non-profit organizations in their work, in implementing necessary public and social objectives, is definitely a priority of a democratic state.
And, of course, today a modern and prosperous nation can exist only with and within the free flow of information.
A powerful and independent media, both federal and regional where there are a lot of problems print and electronic, and so-called new media are an integral part of this.
But in the twentieth century our spiritual and moral framework has virtually been destroyed.
And today, this ‘spirit’ of disregard for the law is present everywhere.
Let us reflect: it is happening at the level of consumer awareness (we do not even wince when buying pirated CDs and DVDs).
And at the level of business, when the agreement that defines the multimillion obligations of the Parties is simply written on a piece of paper, with three points, and the payments is simply in bags of cash.
And finally, it is manifest in more serious offences in crimes that are being committed, unfortunately, in large numbers, including corruption in government, corruption, which today occurs at an enormous scale, and fighting which must become a national programme.

We need to understand clearly: if we want to become a civilized state, first of all we need to become a lawful one.
Dear colleagues!
Serious steps should be taken to eliminate the waste that has accumulated as a result of decades of economic and military activity and the man-made accidents that have occurred in the country.
Suffice it to say that in Russia more than 80 billion tonnes of solid waste has accumulated in landfills and repositories.
At the same time, we should encourage establishing a sector of clean technologies in the Russian economy.
One way of doing this is tougher sanctions for businesses that have a negative impact on the environment.
Thus far the only positive trend is a decline in the amount of contaminated waste water, a trend that began five or six years ago.
It has declined by about 40 per cent since the beginning of the 1990s.
But 40 per cent of surface water and 17 per cent of underground sources of drinking water do not meet health standards as defined by the regulations.
There is an increase in emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere, an increase in the amount of waste, and more land affected by these problems.
The main culprits are the so-called dirty businesses and vehicles.
The highest air pollution from industrial enterprises registered is in Norilsk, Nizhni Tagil, Magnitogorsk, Novokuznetsk and Cherepovets.
From vehicles it is in the large cities: Moscow, St Petersburg, and Krasnodar.
We need to actively promote environmental innovation now.
This is one of the most lucrative and fastest growing sectors in the world economy, and offers an opportunity for considerable budgetary saving.
According to the experts, in 2006 more than 50 billion dollars was invested in renewable energy technology.
That is about a 33 per cent increase, and it is expected that by the end of 2007 that this investment will total around 70 billion dollars.
That is a huge amount of money.
In fact, such innovative technologies have become a large self-sustaining market with tremendous potential.
Russia must move quickly to gain a foothold in this market.

INTERVIEW WITH ITOGI MAGAZINE
As a popular saying goes, in Russia there are no ways of protecting yourself against ill fortune; now it seems there are also no ways of protecting yourself from the presidency.
People in the know have long confirmed that you, Dmitry Anatolyevich, will sit in the exalted halls of the Kremlin, and you always denied this, saying that all you found interesting were the national projects.
First of all, I am not the President of Russia, merely a presidential candidate.
Secondly, overseeing the national projects is something I have been devoted to for more than two years.
Finally, thirdly, the Russian proverb you quoted is true.
It is the quintessence of folk wisdom: live your life well but remember that one is never safe from misfortune and trouble.
Even though I wasn’t feigning anything when I said that I wasn’t planning to take on the position of head of state.
Of course, as each person chooses a path in life they must have an ultimate goal in mind.
A career is just such an instance.
The lieutenant thinks about one day receiving a marshal’s baton, and if one chooses an administrative and political career then it is natural to want to climb the ladder as high as possible.
But this linear process is more difficult in reality.
When I moved to Moscow in 1999 I could not have imagined that in eight years I would be running for president.
Did you worry about whether you could carry the load?
Of course.
In the civil service there are a lot of defects and limitations, but there is one undeniable quality.
The knowledge that the decisions you take can affect the lives of millions of people makes you evaluate every step you take or word you say differently.
I repeat that this is another degree of responsibility and, therefore, another degree of self-realisation.
Such a feeling doesn’t exist even when working for a very large business.
As a corporate lawyer, this experience was extremely interesting for me.

What arguments did you try?
What was Svetlana Vladimirovna doing in Petersburg at the time?
The same thing as now: bringing up our son, establishing and maintaing a home.
This is difficult and responsible work.
I say this without a hint of irony.
Patriarchy!
What to do about it?
This is normal logic for a man, who wishes to have a solid and reliable rear guard behind.
Of course, from time to time Sveta did say that it would be good to find some additional activity, but I explained that in my opinion it is better for the family if the wife stays at home.
How long have you been together?
We have known each other since seventh grade.
You figure it out.
You know how old I am and I am not going to tell you my wife’s age: you can guess yourself.
I retain very good, bright, warm memories of those years.
From my graduating year 80 per cent entered university at the first try.
Both received degrees with honours, but their careers somehow didn’t take off.
I remember when I was younger listening to her stories about Russian history and being proud that I had such a clever mother.
I love Pavlovsk.
I have memories of the fruit, growing right in the streets, from these first trips to the south.
I had never seen plums, apples and pears hanging from the trees in Petersburg.
It is an amazing sight for people from the north!
But I must confess that I didn’t like beach vacations.
It’s boring to spend the whole day lying on your back in the sun!
In short it was deadly boring rather than a vacation!
In what sense?
Nothing criminal, normal boyhood fun.
I know that some of my peers in St Petersburg tried to earn their first wages by selling black market badges and matrioshka to foreigners, but I wasn’t involved in this.
Foreign tourists didn’t come round to the outskirts of town where we lived.
Not to excess.
Also my parents were always very measured when drinking alcohol, and it is well-known that a lot is passed on to successive generations, both the bad and the good.
As they grow up children begin to copy their parents.
My wife blames me sometimes for bringing my son up too liberally.
I reply that I also grew up without receiving any severe punishment.
I don’t consider that using a belt or physical force are the best ways of persuasion.
I heard that you were baptized as an adult?
At age twenty-three.
I think that it marked the beginning of a new life for me.
I would suggest stopping there: it’s too personal to go into the details.

You give the impression of being a very closed person.
Really?
But I know why that is.
I have a legal way of thinking, which has pluses and minuses.
Dignity consists in the ability to correctly formulate your goals.
This helps in making decisions.
The disadvantage lies in the fact that often I say and explain more precisely than is sometimes needed.
Because of this, you might feel as if I am Mr Dry-as-Dust, all buttoned up.
That means that spin-doctors and stylists are not doing their work.
There are no such people in my surroundings.
Now we’ll try to fill in the gaps.
Did you have a nickname as a child?
Which ones?
Paddling a one-man kayak.
Even though I would not say that I made enormous strides.
At the beginning I couldn’t do a couple of chin-ups and then I became school champion in this exercise.
Not for the sake of records but to keep fit and to get credits for PE.
And did sports prevent you from doing well in school?
Here is the story.
In the sense that we didn’t starve though we had little money.
I clearly remember how this affected my birthday which was at the beginning of September and, by strange coincidence, still is.
Dima, do not expect anything special, they would say.
Jeans and LPs.
And my parents could not buy me either.
The ten ruble bill got used up quickly, but the memories remain.
But now we will soon have a new holiday, the Day of the Lawyer.
If only it could help create the rule of law.

I agree.
To overcome the legal nihilism preventing the country from developing harmoniously is a long and difficult job.
As it turned out, to establish a workable model of a market economy is much easier than laying the foundations of a state in which people respect the letter of the law.
This is another demonstration of the thesis that democracy cannot occur in any given place after two or three years.
It requires painstaking, persistent work to improve the legal and political system.
Of course, one can not forget the distinctive characteristics of the Russian situation.
You know, justice has always relied on a mechanism for enforcing its implementation, some kind of public stick.
But if it is not based on a set of moral imperatives, on internal convictions and moral principles, if it simply aspires to the crude power of a punitive machine, then the structure it creates will be flawed and ineffective.
These are both equally bad.
We all remember what the well known doctrines of the thirties and forties led to, when the talk was of class dictatorship and the presumption of guilt in criminal trials.
You have to feel what justice is, accept it voluntarily, not obey it in some insanely prostrate way.
The explosion was inevitable, it would have happened sooner or later.
This is what happened in the nineties.
Do you think that the current system of justice is better?
Though based on quite good, solid regulatory framework, our judicial system continues to function, getting its bearings from old traditions.
Disregard for the law in various sectors of society remains widespread.
Until we change people’s attitudes, until we convince them there is only one law and no one is above it, there will be no change for the better.
The strength of the rule of law consists in the fact that no one can influence it.
Neither pressure from various authorities, including the most powerful, nor pressure from business nor social forces.
Justice should be in harmony with all the participants in this process, and refuse to cave in to anyone.
These are fine words, Dmitry Anatolyevich, but how can they be put into practice?
You can start small.
For example, recommend that judges at all levels keep to a minimum all contact with businessmen and even representatives of public services.
To retain maximum independence and objectivity.

You can’t put people in a cage.
You don’t have to.
It’s enough if you can completely eliminate the personal factor.
The more faceless the legal machinery becomes, the stronger it is.
I am absolutely convinced of this.
And where will the centre of power be?
In the Kremlin, a president, in the White House, a national leader, there could be a split between them, and then.
It would seem that you haven’t been paying attention.
There is no such thing as two, three, or five centres.
The president controls Russia, and according to the Constitution there can be only one.
Remember that I am speaking now about the highest office in the nation, not a specific person.
But in the previous eight years everything has been put together under a specific person whose name we know.
And that wasn’t the case in the eight years before that?
Today Vladimir Putin is not preparing to leave politics.
That’s exactly why I am telling you not to worry.
Decisions will be taken according to the Constitution, and the bonds between the president and the prime minister will prove effective.
Vladimir Vladimirovich and I fully understand that this union will be able to work only in an atmosphere of mutual trust and partnership.

I think that everything we’ve done in Russia in the last eight years has benefited the country.
Of course there are problems, but the positive achievements are obvious, and it would be stupid to argue against them.
So I don’t need to win a bunch of verbal battles with those who have never been at the helm of state machines, whose programmes are outdated and obviously have no chance of being implemented.
The advantages of power, its superiority and its problems, are bound up with the fact that it deals with specific cases in ways that may or may not please the electorate but are nonetheless actually visible.
In the final analysis the voter has to think of everything: the situation in the country, relations with the current leader, a lot of other factors, among which listening to public rhetoric is not the most important.
In other words, the debates in this context are secondary.
And there’s another reason: the rules of the game.
Engaging in a direct debate with opponents from the ranks of the long-term survivors, the government candidate unwittingly helps them out, providing his rivals with an additional plug.
So you do not want to share your popularity?
Absolutely not.
That does not make sense, since the objective of any effective government is maintaining stability and the continuation of the course that has been chosen.
We don’t want disturbances of any kind.
They say that the kickbacks in Russia compare to the whole budget of the country .
It’s obvious that the value of these bribes is astronomical.
I repeat, we are going to do fight this.
How?
Conservative methods are the most effective.
Surgery is necessary to bring some of our more presumptuous comrades to their senses.
I can explain the necessary therapy: serve the state in order to deal with large-scale processes and acquire the experience of a top manager.
Learn, make yourself a career, and then go and realise your ambitions in business.
This is called capialization.
In the west, often ministers and even prime ministers become consultants for private corporations and receive good money, and this is not considered corruption.
Rather, it is very much valued.
Do you have time to watch television?
I usually watch the news, more and more via the Internet.
I go to www.1tv.ru, or www.vesti.ru or www.ntv.ru and look for subjects that I might have missed during the day.
This is much more convenient than watching them on the box.
What about your family?
I guess Ilya is no longer a child.
I wouldn’t want to say that.
No, I mean he doesn’t kick the ball around with the guys now the way you used to.
I would rather say that he never has done that.
Sometimes his grandfather takes him out, sometimes I do.
In short, my son isn’t really used to being outside, and I’ll tell you honestly that that concerns me.
Playing outside is a great way of being exposed to what awaits you.
By the way, on the subject of sport.
What about the third?
What should we expect, in a word?

Russia has problems insofar as swimming is concerned.
As someone who is twice a day in a swimming lane, I want to point out that there is a disastrous shortage of swimming pools in this country.
So, we should start trying to master the crawl and the breaststroke?
And play football.
We’ll have to do something with that!
The people are so fond of this game, and we haven’t had any great successes in the international arena for a hundred years.
We are fed up with waiting!
Especially over the English, so to speak, given the political implications!
It would also be good to beat the Germans and the Italians.
I’m not making any political allusions.
Feb. 15, 2008
SPEECH AT THE V KRASNOYARSK ECONOMIC FORUM
Colleagues,
It is clear today that at this stage in history individual behaviour, individual family lifestyles and freedom for self-expression are determining factors in successful development.
To repeat the President’s words: “Investment in people is our long-term national priority”.
This is above all the responsibility of the state, of course, but not of the state alone.
We need to create strong incentives for private investment in all areas of the social sphere, including through the use of active tax incentives.
Private spending on education, healthcare and pensions should be counted as deductible expenditure for profit tax purposes and should also be exempt from the consolidated social tax and personal income tax to the greatest reasonable and possible extent.
I think that similar procedures could apply to companies that co-finance interest payments on their employees’ mortgage loans.
We also need to draft laws aimed at creating a comfortable tax environment for philanthropic activity.
We have already begun this work but we still have much to do.
Substantially increased public and private investment in social development will lay the conditions for realising citizens’ potential and developing a new society in which everyone, be they workers or students, teachers or doctors, civil servants or entrepreneurs, is motivated to create and consume goods and services of the highest and most advanced standards.
This is, in effect, a society with a new culture.
It will be formed, of course, on the basis of the cultural wealth we have already accumulated and must preserve and look after in every way.
But as we face a colossal flood of information, only moral and intellectual ‘filters’ can prevent the soul from losing its bearings in the midst of this enormous flow.
This is something we also need to think about.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Many people have not seen the benefits of economic growth and development in their own lives and do not feel as though they are living in the country with the world’s seventh biggest GDP.
Part of the population is still living in a social coma.
They do not see opportunities and prospects for improving their living standards.
This is one of the causes of alcoholism and a suicide rate that still remains very high.
Unless we create equal opportunities for people, all declarations about innovation and the importance of economic transformation will be meaningless.
A modern economy requires a modern social development policy.
The focus of social policy should not be particular sectors within the social sphere (we have already tried this approach) but each citizen, each family, and it is around these families and individuals that we must build and fashion our healthcare, education and social support systems and create wide-ranging opportunities for people’s self-fulfillment.
The President set the goals of dramatically increasing life expectancy and reducing the death rate.
To achieve these goals we must first reduce deaths and disability caused by diseases that modern medicine already knows how to cure.
We must work over these coming years to substantially reduce deaths from heart attacks, strokes, malignant tumours and road accidents, tackle infectious diseases and reduce the number of cases of disability caused by complex forms of diabetes and allergies.
This is just the minimum programme we need to carry out.
This requires reorganisation of our healthcare system.
We are living under the illusion that healthcare in this country is free, but this is not the case.
We collect huge amounts of taxes to fund this healthcare system and everyone is paying for their health from their own pockets.
We end up with a situation where we take money from people to pay for their healthcare but then tell them that they cannot choose their doctor, cannot choose their treatment and cannot choose what to be treated for.
We assign them to a local doctor, medical centre or district hospital and tell them that, like it or not, they have to go there, have to wait their turn in the long queues, even if the service is rude and the treatment inadequate.
Our healthcare system has combined the worst elements of the Soviet system and the biggest problems of a market-based healthcare system and it offers people no alternative.
This is not the fault of our doctors; this is the system that the state has established.
It is absolutely clear that the state must make it possible for people to choose their own medical centre, their own doctor and insurance company.
The money the state collects from citizens in the form of taxes and fees should go to doctors only through the patients, through the provision of quality service to these patients, and not through local healthcare administration officials or on the basis of funding estimates.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The legal possibility should exist for uniting all of these different sources of money coming from state and private funds into one channel.
It should not matter which medical centre a person chooses — municipal, federal, private, in his home town or in some other place — what matters is that this is his money and therefore his right to choose.
Comfortable housing is also an integral part of our well being.
Our homes, after all, are the places where we found our families and raise our children.
We have already taken steps to build more and better housing, and we will continue working in this direction.
This is a huge social and economic project and it is an important foundation for growth in the entire economy.
But this is not enough.
We no longer want to build homes of the standard old kind now.
We no longer want to live in such homes.
Now we need to lay the foundations for industrial-scale production of individual homes that would not cost more than a city apartment.
We want to give more people the possibility of buying not just housing but acquiring their own home and land.
This is not an easy undertaking but it is a realistic objective.
For every citizen, having a home and land of one’s own is a form of capital, a little homeland, and the possibility of adapting and rebuilding as family circumstances change.
It creates a different mentality in people which has nothing in common with the grubby building entrances we know from communal life.
It has often been the case in our history that no sooner has our country begun to spread its wings than we have been irresponsibly catapulted into armed conflict or had revolution come tumbling down on our heads.
But we have learned something from history, namely, that we cannot be indifferent to our future and that stable and consistent development is absolutely vital for us today.
But stability does not mean relaxing and doing nothing while the petrodollars rain down.
We have accumulated such potential for development today that it would be stupid and immoral not to make use of it, not to seize this opportunity for economic growth, technological modernisation, raising our people’s living standards and creating a society that is genuinely able to withstand outside upheavals.
We have everything we need for this, and above all, we have our greatest treasure — our people.
A few words in conclusion: “We must finally gain the right and the strength to take charge of our own present and decide our policies in culture, in the economy and in state law.
We answer before time and we cannot place all of the responsibility on our rightfully esteemed and respected forebears.
We are free and we are therefore responsible”.
These words belong to Academician [Dmitry] Likhachev and I fully agree with them.

INSIDER’S TIP When the crowds get to be too much during weekends, escape to Mammoth’s lesser-known sister resort, June Mountain, 20 miles away, where your Mammoth ski ticket is still valid.
With 500 acres of terrain and 2,590 feet of vertical, there are enough slopes to get lost in without ever knowing you’re in the weekend rush.
FAMILY INFORMATION Small World, at the Mammoth Mountain Inn, takes care of newborns and toddlers ($99 per day) while older youngsters can take full-day ski or snowboarding lessons for $155, which includes rentals, tickets and snacks.
The newly renovated Wonderland Park under Chair 7 features kid-friendly freestyle terrain with a mini half-pipe.
DINING
Breakfast Locals and visitors alike crowd into the Breakfast Club (2987 Main Street; 760-934-6944), a cozy coffee shop for huevos rancheros ($8.99), biscuits with gravy ($6.59) and other slope fuel.
On-Mountain Dining Marketplace Food Court at the Panorama Gondola mid-station is well located and stocked for drawing skiers in several times a day.
This spacious and carpeted spot offers replenishing mountain food at a bakery, salad, soup, pizza and pasta station.
Many skiers also just kick back on the deck for a barbecue Angus beef burger ($9.50) while enjoying the sun and vistas at 9,630 feet.

Low-End, In-Town Dining Giovanni’s (437 Old Mammoth Road; 760-934-7563; www.mammothweb.com/eat/giovannis), which features carbo-rich meals that seem to soothe all the sore and empty spots, is a merry big-plate Italian family restaurant.
Slide into the side booths for excellent mammoth pizzas (starts at $23.25), which have fed many a van-load of skiers, while the lasagna ($12.75 with soup or salad, and garlic bread) would be hearty bargain, even at sea level.
High-End, In-Town Dining Even nonskiers drive to Mammoth to dine at Skadi (Sherwin Plaza III shopping mall, 587 Old Mammoth Road; 760-934-3902; www.restaurantskadi.com), where the chef and owner, Ian Algeroen, has been wowing diners for 14 years with elegantly robust dishes like duck with lingonberries and aquavit ($28), or venison porcini with grilled sausage ($32) — the venison comes from the restaurant’s own ranch.
NIGHT LIFE
Après-Ski Those in the know park their skis at the Main Lodge and cross the parking lot to the Cervinia Restaurant (1 Minaret Road; 760-934-0636) for a kitschy slice of the Alps, from its mural of Berchtesgaden to the log walls imported from Switzerland.
Located in the same building as the Yodler Bar & Pub, heat-seekers gather by the open fire for a Mammoth Mocha, a mix of hot chocolate, brandy and Baileys ($7).
Prost!
Après Après-Ski The village has a handful of bars where Southern California’s imported glamazons seek out the perfect vibe of the moment, though that shifts more often than the snow drifts atop Panorama Lookout.
Luckily the “Big Three” night spots are almost within snowball-throwing distance of each other: Whiskey Creek (24 Lake Mary Road; 760-934-2555) is the quintessential ski resort bar with microbrews on tap (starting at $4) and under-dressed 20-somethings keeping warm to the hip-hop and cover bands.
Auld Dubliner (6201 Minaret Road; 760-924-7320; www.aulddubliner.com/Mammoth) is a colorful sprawl of an Irish pub featuring, of course, draft Guinness ($6) and Irish bands, while upstairs Lakanuki (760-934-7447; www.lakanuki.com) pours out the mai tais and hurricanes ($7 each) from its tiki bar.
LODGING
Frugal The Holiday Haus (3905 Main Street; 760-934-2414; www.holidayhaus.net) has been a ski-bum’s delight for three generations and features fireplaces, full kitchens and free parking within an easy ski-boot walk to the village gondola.
The Jacuzzi is notoriously moody, but with doubles ranging from $60 to $155, all can be forgiven.
Not So Frugal The Westin Monache (100 Canyon Boulevard; 760-934-2526; www.westinmammoth.com), which opened across the street from the village gondola last winter, is strikingly modern for Mammoth and brings a new level of full-service luxury to a town where both your car and your skis get valets.
Hey, is this Aspen?
One-room suites with a kitchenette start at around $324 depending on the season.

But he was willing to say, in effect, “I told you so,” in recalling his warning a year ago about “weakened lending practices” in the mortgage market.
“That conviction made a borrower’s income and cash equity seem unimportant to lenders, who shoveled out money, confident that H.P.A.
— house price appreciation — would cure all problems.
Today, our country is experiencing widespread pain because of that erroneous belief.
As house prices fall, a huge amount of financial folly is being exposed.
You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out — and what we are witnessing at some of our largest financial institutions is an ugly sight.”
His criticism of other companies was based on the fact that many assume their pension funds will earn 8 percent a year from investments, a return he deems unlikely given the low level of interest rates, but one that lets them report higher profits now.
He compared money managers who promise double-digit returns to the queen in “Alice in Wonderland,” who proclaimed, “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.” Mr. Buffett added, “Beware the glib helper who fills your head with fantasies while he fills his pockets with fees.”
Mr. Buffett pointed out that some companies with pension plans in both Europe and the United States assume better returns on the American plans than the European ones.

“This discrepancy is puzzling,” he said.
“Why should these companies not put their U.S. managers in charge of the non-U.S. pension assets and let them work their magic on these assets as well?
I’ve never seen this puzzle explained.
But the auditors and actuaries who are charged with vetting the return assumptions seem to have no problem with it.”
“What is no puzzle, however, is why C.E.O.s opt for a high investment assumption: It lets them report higher earnings.
And if they are wrong, as I believe they are, the chickens won’t come home to roost until long after they retire.”
Mr. Buffett also had harsh words for state and local governments.
“Public pension promises are huge and, in many cases, funding is woefully inadequate.
Because the fuse on this time bomb is long, politicians flinch from inflicting tax pain, given that problems will only become apparent long after these officials have departed.
Promises involving very early retirement — sometimes to those in their low 40s — and generous cost-of-living adjustments are easy for these officials to make.
In a world where people are living longer and inflation is certain, those promises will be anything but easy to keep.”

He did not discuss why he wanted to insure municipal bonds issued by governments making such promises.
Mr. Buffett also warned of lower profits ahead for the insurance industry, which has benefited from two years without major disasters.
“That party is over,” he said.
“It’s a certainty that insurance-industry profit margins, including ours, will fall significantly in 2008.
Prices are down, and exposures inexorably rise.”
Berkshire’s investment in Sanofi-Aventis showed a profit of $109 million at the end of the year, but that profit has since vanished as the share price fell 23 percent in the first two months of 2008 amid concerns over possible generic competition for its best-selling drug.
On a $4.7 billion investment, Berkshire is now ahead by about $600 million.
But the real position earned $100 million in 2007, according to the report.

South Orange is home to Little League dads and soccer moms who hustle to the New Jersey Transit Morristown Line’s express train every morning, but it also has a lively arts community and is regarded as a cultural and social melting pot.
The village president, Douglas Newman, and his slate on the board of trustees were elected last spring on a promise to enhance development already under way downtown with an overarching municipal plan.
That way, he said, “we can be more in the driver’s seat with the next steps we take.”
Construction has begun on a residential and retail project on Vose Avenue, two blocks from the train station.
A long-closed ShopRite supermarket adjacent to the project has been sold and renovated, and a gourmet market is expected soon.
There are also plans to build a residential and retail building near the train trestle that crosses South Orange Avenue, in a lot once used as a car dealership.
Because nearly 90 percent of the tax base is residential, taxes are hefty.
Properties recently underwent reassessments, a topic much discussed on the community message board, maplewood.southorangevillage.com.
But when taken together with its convenience to commuters, South Orange’s eclectic charm and cultural assets have made it appealing to those who do not want to feel as if they were hibernating at night.
WHAT YOU’LL FIND
South Orange occupies about 2.8 square miles and is about 15 miles due west of Manhattan.
Seton Hall University, at the eastern edge of the township, lies near the Vailsburg section of Newark.
The handsome Montrose neighborhood, settled more than a century ago by wealthy families from New York and Newark, is north of campus.
The New Jersey Transit railroad tracks bisect the township from north to south, with South Orange Avenue, the main thoroughfare, running from east to west.
The train station on South Orange Avenue marks the center of the commercial district.
Village Hall, built in the 1890s, looms two blocks east.

Despite grumbling from some residents, public parking rates recently doubled, to 50 cents per hour, with a parking enforcement truck making the rounds.
There is a Starbucks at the station, and those who make a dash inside without feeding the meters are said to be risking a “$30 cup of coffee.”
Signs on Interstate 280 often lump the township into a region known as “the Oranges,” with Orange, East Orange and West Orange.
But South Orange has a decidedly different feel: less urban than Orange and East Orange, but less spread out than West Orange.

WHAT YOU’LL PAY
The median home sale price was $552,000 in 2007, versus $620,000 a year earlier, according to the West Essex Board of Realtors.
Among the 112 houses on the market is a four-bedroom 1928 colonial near Seton Hall, for $399,000; a restored six-bedroom 1892 colonial within walking distance of the station, reduced in price to $999,000 from $1.195 million; and a renovated 133-year-old six-bedroom house, for $1.8 million.

Michael Auer, a 20-year South Orange resident who is an agent for Coldwell Banker in Short Hills, described South Orange as having some virtues that keep drawing buyers.“You still have an influx of people who move out there for the train lines,” Mr. Auer said.
“That gives these transit towns a break over the surrounding communities.”
Nancy Gould, a broker for Keller Williams in Maplewood who lives in South Orange, said that lower interest rates were helping, and that she had recently been involved in a multiple-bid sale.
“The redevelopment has helped the agents show off the area in a nice light,” she said.
WHAT TO DO
This is the season to see the sledders and snowboarders flocking to Floods Hill, not far from the Baird Community Center — which used to be a clubhouse for a surrounding golf course and is now the hub of the village’s extensive recreation and cultural affairs program.
On spring and summer evenings, there always seem to be several baseball games being played on the diamonds that surround the center, which also offers tennis courts and a public swimming pool.
(An annual pool badge is $20 per individual resident.)
The Pierro Gallery on the center’s second floor features work by, but not limited to, area artists.

THE SCHOOLS
The School District of South Orange and Maplewood has 6,100 students in one high school, two middle schools and seven elementary schools.
According to the district, 46 percent of students are white, 46 percent black, 4 percent Hispanic and 3 percent Asian.
The student body numbers 1,865 at Columbia High School, an 80-year-old Collegiate Gothic building that sits a block from the South Orange border.
South Orange proper has three primary schools.
Some students attend South Mountain Annex in kindergarten and first grade, then South Mountain Elementary from second to fifth grade.
The Board of Education mandates that classes in the district number no more than 22 in kindergarten and 26 in fourth and fifth grades.
On weekdays there are 24 Midtown Direct trains to Pennsylvania Station; depending on the number of stops, the trip takes 30 to 40 minutes.
In addition, 38 trains run daily to Hoboken and PATH trains.
Each line charges $154 for a monthly pass.
Commuter permits for three municipal parking lots cost $270 a year, when they can be had.
The township is taking applications, but the wait is classified as indefinite.
Another lot, owned by New Jersey Transit, costs $840 a year.
Three jitney lines run through the township.
The fare is $1; an annual pass is $150.
The first English settlers built homes in the ensuing 10 years.
The Old Stone House, a portion of it believed to predate the Revolutionary War, stands near Grove Park, adjacent to Seton Hall.

“Taxpayers are paying billions of dollars in increased costs because of the dual standard used by the rating bureaus,” said Bill Lockyer, treasurer of California, who is leading a nationwide campaign to change the way the bonds are rated.
California, one of the largest issuers of municipal bonds, is rated A; Mr. Lockyer said the state should be triple A.

The state is soliciting support from other municipalities for a letter it intends to send to the ratings agencies, arguing that municipal bonds should be rated on the same scale as the one used for corporate bonds.
Because of their relatively weak credit scores, more than half of all municipal borrowers buy insurance policies that safeguard their bonds in the unlikely event that they fail to pay the debt.
The issuers of the bonds pay a single fee to ratings firms like Standard & Poor’s, whether or not the securities are insured.
Bond insurance companies also pay the ratings firms annual fees, which increase as the companies’ insurance portfolios grow.
Officials at ratings firms and bond insurance companies defend the system, saying it gives investors the information they need to buy bonds with confidence.
The recent turmoil, they say, highlights the need for insurance.
They further add that rating municipal bonds like corporate debt would not save taxpayers much money, if any.
The outcry in the municipal market comes at a difficult time for the ratings firms and bond insurers.
S.& P., Moody’s and Fitch Ratings have drawn criticism for assigning their highest grades to securities tied to subprime mortgages, only to downgrade them later as defaults surged and the investments tumbled in value.
The plunging fortunes of bond guarantors, meantime, have cast doubt over the value of the insurance policies municipalities buy.
“We are learning essentially that the emperor may have no clothes, that there is no real reason to require these towns to have insurance in many instances,” said Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, who is investigating the ratings firms on antitrust grounds.
“And it simply serves the bottom lines of the ratings agencies, the insurers or both.”
The House Financial Services Committee plans to examine how municipal bonds are rated at a hearing on March 12.

At every rating, municipal bonds default less often than similarly rated corporate bonds, according to Moody’s.
In fact, since 1970, A-rated municipal bonds have defaulted far less frequently than corporate bonds with top triple-A ratings.
Furthermore, when municipalities do default, investors usually receive some — or even all — of their money back, unlike in most corporate bankruptcies.
But critics like Mr. Lockyer and Mr. Blumenthal face an uphill battle to change the Wall Street system.
Upgrading municipal ratings would dramatically alter the landscape of the $2.6 trillion market; Moody’s estimates that more than half of the market would be rated triple A or double A using the corporate scale.
Triple-A securities are considered nearly as safe as Treasury bonds issued by the federal government.
Moreover, some bond specialists caution that this is the wrong time to rerate municipal bonds.
The slowing economy and faltering housing market are squeezing state and city tax revenue.
At the same time, public pension liabilities keep rising.
Facing budget shortfalls, states like California, New Jersey and Arizona are cutting services.
Ratings firms, bond insurance companies and some bond investors defend the separate ratings scales, arguing that it allows investors to make distinctions among various debt and, ultimately, set appropriate interest rates.
Defenders of the current system say that sophisticated investors understand that the letter grades assigned to corporate bonds and municipal debt mean different things.
“The distance between point A and point B is the same” whether it is measured in inches of centimeters, Ms. Sussman said.

Moody’s says it is willing to discuss changing its scale; so far few local and state officials have asked for a change, Ms. Sussman said.
Executives at S.& P., however, say they use a single global rating scale to measure all kinds of debt.
(Data on S.& P.-rated municipal and corporate debt from the early 1980s to 2006 show similar differences in default rates as those rated by Moody’s.)

Some sophisticated bond investors say that if municipalities were rated on the same scale as corporations, it would be harder to distinguish the relative riskiness of various cities, states and school districts, and mutual fund companies would have to evaluate bonds issue by issue.
“If you rate 95 percent of the issues the same, the ratings cease to be useful, and investors need and utilize these ratings to differentiate credits,” said John Miller, chief investment officer at Nuveen Asset Management in Chicago, which manages about $65 billion in mostly tax-exempt bonds.
But local and state officials counter that a universal rating system would emphasize the relative safety of their debt against other bonds, arguably attracting more investors.
In periods of stress like now more ready buyers would help reduce instability and help keep borrowing costs low.
So far, Mr. Lockyer has won support for his plan from half a dozen states, including Connecticut, Oregon and Washington, as well as from numerous cities and local authorities.
They plan to send a letter to the three ratings agencies early this week calling for action.
New York City’s bond rating is double A.
The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada, which represents 17,200 local and state governments, is weighing whether it wants to take a stand on the issue before its annual conference in June.
The debate is not new.
It has been pushed to the forefront because of the recent concern about the strength of bond insurance companies like MBIA and the Ambac Financial Group, which together guarantee interest and principal payments on $733 billion in municipal debt.
The insurers are themselves rated triple A — on the corporate scale — by Moody’s and S.& P., and essentially transfer those gilt-edged ratings to municipal issuers through the policies they sell.
In exchange, they typically pay lower interest rates on their debt than they would without the insurance.

Robert G. Shoback, a senior managing director of public finance at Ambac, said bond insurance lowered the cost of borrowing money, especially for smaller municipalities and school districts that might not be well known on Wall Street.
Investors have relied on insurance for “comfort, confidence and stability,” he said.
“The industry is at a significant point now in how it views itself, how it interprets risk and how it will use insurance going forward,” said Thomas Doe, chief executive of Municipal Market Advisors, a research firm.
The California group and other municipalities say there may be some middle ground where the two sides could compromise.
Ms. Sussman, of Moody’s, said the firm would be wary about adding qualifiers to triple-A ratings, which the company regards as “gilt-edged.”
The Dow Jones industrial average spent the day moving in and out of negative territory, closing down 7 points.

The move away from the dollar is partially a symptom of problems in the credit markets, which have left investors wary of even the safest debt.

Shipments to the United States may make up a dwindling share of exports by many Asian countries as trade within the region has grown.
But much of the region’s trade consists of increasingly specialized production in each country of components that are traded and then assembled in China for final sale to the United States.
Asian economies still retain considerable strengths.
From China and Japan to South Korea and India, most Asian economies have accumulated sizable foreign exchange reserves.
With the exception of India, with its heavy reliance on imported oil, the region’s largest economies tend to be running overall trade surpluses.
With the euro strong, many are chasing buyers in Europe with considerable success.
The result is a feeling of insulation, but not immunity, from the troubles in the United States.
“From our position in Asia, though, this feels rather like standing on the shoreline watching a storm raging far out at sea,” Garry Evans, the chief Asia equity strategist at HSBC, said in a recent research note.

For asset-dependent, bubble-prone economies, a cyclical recovery — even when assisted by aggressive monetary and fiscal accommodation — isn’t a given.
That game is now over.
Washington policymakers may not be able to arrest this post-bubble downturn.
Interest rate cuts are unlikely to halt the decline in nationwide home prices.
Given the outsize imbalance between supply and demand for new homes, housing prices may need to fall an additional 20 percent to clear the market.
Aggressive interest rate cuts have not done much to contain the lethal contagion spreading in credit and capital markets.
Now that their houses are worth less and loans are harder to come by, hard-pressed consumers are unlikely to be helped by lower interest rates.
Japan’s experience demonstrates how difficult it may be for traditional policies to ignite recovery after a bubble.

In the United States, a full-blown credit crisis could do the same.
The unwinding of excessive corporate indebtedness in Japan and a “keiretsu” culture of companies buying one another’s equity shares put extraordinary pressures on business spending.
In America, an excess of household indebtedness could put equally serious and lasting restrictions on consumer spending.
Like their counterparts in Japan in the 1990s, American authorities may be deluding themselves into believing they can forestall the endgame of post-bubble adjustments.
Government aid is being aimed, mistakenly, at maintaining unsustainably high rates of personal consumption.
Yet that’s precisely what got the United States into this mess in the first place — pushing down the savings rate, fostering a huge trade deficit and stretching consumers to take on an untenable amount of debt.

A more effective strategy would be to try to tilt the economy away from consumption and toward exports and long-needed investments in infrastructure.
Such a shift in the mix of the economy will require export-friendly measures like a weaker dollar and increased consumption by the rest of the world, which would strengthen demand for American-made goods.
Fiscal initiatives should be directed at laying the groundwork for future growth, especially by upgrading the nation’s antiquated highways, bridges and ports.
That’s not to say Washington shouldn’t help the innocent victims of the bubble’s aftermath — especially lower- and middle-income families.
But the emphasis should be on providing income support for those who have been blindsided by this credit crisis rather than on rekindling excess spending by overextended consumers.
By focusing on exports and on infrastructure spending, we might be able to limit the recession.
Such an approach might also set the stage for a more balanced and sustainable economic upturn in the next cycle.
A stimulus package aimed at exports and infrastructure investment would be an important step in that direction.
The toughest, and potentially most relevant, lesson to take from Japan’s economy in the 1990s was that the interplay between financial and real economic bubbles causes serious damage.
An equally lethal interplay between the bursting of housing and credit bubbles is now at work in the United States.
American authorities, especially Federal Reserve officials, harbor the mistaken belief that swift action can forestall a Japan-like collapse.
The greater imperative is to avoid toxic asset bubbles in the first place.
Steeped in denial and engulfed by election-year myopia, Washington remains oblivious of the dangers ahead.

Toshihiko Fukui, whose five-year term ends on March 19.
A former finance ministry bureaucrat, Mr. Muto has been groomed by Mr. Fukui to be his successor and is expected to make a smooth transition.
“We’ve made a very good choice,” Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said.
“We need to choose someone who can tackle agendas when we need to implement monetary policies and run the economy very carefully.”
But the opposition party says Mr. Muto is too politically connected as a former official in the finance ministry, adding that the central bank should be clearly independent.

There is more on the drawing board for this area, which encompasses the waterfront radiating northward from Getty Square, the core of this 18-square-mile city.
But already it is attracting new kinds of residents, some of them young professionals whom the area’s investors call “urban pioneers.” As a catalyst for change in this city of nearly 200,000 (the fourth-largest in the state), the neighborhood has fed expectations among officials like Mayor Philip A. Amicone, who knows all too well its history of repeated revitalization attempts.

“I’ve lived in this city since I was 2 years old,” said the mayor, 59, “and they’ve been talking about redeveloping the downtown for as long as I can remember.
Now, for the first time, that possibility seems real, especially since more than $1 billion has been invested in recent years along the waterfront.”
The investment is luring people like Hope Maddox, 24, who cited not only the rent (especially affordable compared with New York City’s), but also the 30-minute commute to Grand Central Terminal and an urban setting reminiscent of Brooklyn and Hoboken.
Her rent is $1,400 a month.
“I couldn’t have found something I could afford in the city itself,” she said.
“I would have had to share.” Yet, the glitz and glamour of a new downtown notwithstanding, some worry that in the rebuilding process, too much of the old city’s architecture and history will be swept away.
Nortrud Wolf Spero, the owner of a local real estate company, is of two minds about the revival.
Prices are rising as a result of the development, especially in single-family home areas near Getty Square, where she sells property.
But as a trustee of the Yonkers Historical Society and a member of the City Council’s Green Policy Task Force, she said, she worries “that in the business of renewal, the past could get lost.”
Another worry is the displacement of less affluent residents.
“Upscale is nice,” she said, “but an area should retain its diversity.”

Throughout the area, the refurbished and the decaying exist side by side.
There is the strip of restaurants near the acclaimed new X2O Xaviars on the Hudson; along Main Street, there are others, in addition to a nail salon and a boutique, that have opened in response to the construction.
Yet along Buena Vista Avenue, less than a block from Main Street, buildings like the ornate Romanesque-and-Gothic Teutonia Hall, once a fraternal gathering site for immigrants, stand empty.
Crime remains a problem, acknowledged Lt. Diane Hessler, a spokeswoman for the Police Department, although it has eased somewhat.
According to statistics posted on the department’s Web site, 314 crimes against individuals (like assault, for example) were committed during 2006 in the Fourth Precinct, of which the waterfront district is a part.
But such problems are not deterring developers like Nicholas Sprayregen, who has invested $30 million in 18 contiguous parcels for a future mixed-use development.
He plans to move his offices to Yonkers from Manhattan.

As for any red tape hindering development, Mr. Sprayregen doesn’t let it cramp his style.
“I’m ready to be as patient as I need to be,” he said.
Others are exhibiting less patience.
Struever Fidelco Cappelli, which has an environmental impact statement for a $3.1 billion mixed-use proposal before the City Council, has threatened to withdraw the proposal because of delays.

WHAT YOU’LL PAY
Between the railroad tracks and the river, Collins Enterprises, a developer based in Stamford, Conn., is completing Hudson Park North, two brick towers with 294 luxury units ready to be occupied this spring.
Monthly rents will start at $1,800 for a one-bedroom.
Hudson Park South, the two towers constituting the first phase of the development, has 266 apartments, 97 percent leased, said Rona Siegel, operations vice president of Collins.
Among the renters, she said, are empty nesters, young professionals, actors working in Manhattan, and young families.

They pay $2,100 a month.
Ms. Bender’s commute takes less time, she said, than the bus ride from the East Side walk-up that the couple, both in their early 50s, rented before moving.
In addition to the newer buildings, Ms. Spero said, there are a few dozen units available in converted commercial buildings and above storefronts.
The place has 170 units with floor-to-ceiling windows, a media room, a basketball court and a pet-friendly policy, because “that’s what young singles like,” Mr. Dearden said.
Rents range from $1,400 for a studio to $4,050 for a two-bedroom with river views.
DW Capital also remade the old trolley barn, Metro92; its loft-style one-bedrooms have 20-foot ceilings and 10-foot windows.
Rents start at $2,800.
For buyers, a one-bedroom condo in the Scrimshaw House on the waterfront lists for $249,000.

Metro-North provides 25- to 30-minute service on the Hudson Line from Getty Square Station to Grand Central.
On the return trip, trains stopping in Yonkers leave Grand Central as late as 1:50 a.m. A daily round-trip ticket bought at the station costs $15.50; a monthly bought on the Web is $165.62.
New York Water Taxi offers 45-minute service to the World Financial Center and 57-minute service to Wall Street.
A one-way trip costs $12; a 40-trip ticket is $400.
WHAT TO DO
Residents like Ms. Bender and Mr. Myers frequent restaurants like X2O Xaviars at the pier, and Zuppa Restaurant and Lounge, an Italian restaurant on Main Street.
Andiamo, a takeout and catering arm of Zuppa, is also a favorite, as is Belle Havana, a Cuban-French spot that features live music.
The Beczak Environmental Education Center is in a two-acre riverside park north of the train station.
Events include a Catch of the Day program, with participants in waders dragging a 30-foot net through the water.
The Loft Dance and Fitness on Main Street Square offers classes in yoga, Pilates, body sculpting, cardio kick boxing and jazz funk, among other things.
And for curling up on a sofa with a book while taking in river views, there is no better place than Yonkers’s new 200,000-square-foot public library, a cornerstone of the revitalization effort.
THE SCHOOLS
For families new to the waterfront area apartments, options in the unwieldy and financially troubled Yonkers school system include 29 elementary schools (10 for prekindergarten through Grade 8), three middle schools and six high schools.
In the fall, the district plans to open a College Board Academy high school, in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Total enrollment is 24,153.
Last year, SAT averages were 426 on the verbal, 423 in math and 421 in writing, according to Jerilynne Fierstein, a board of education spokeswoman.

The city’s name honors its founder, Adriaen Van der Donck, known in the 17th century as “Jonkheer” (Dutch for “young gentleman”).
It was where Elisha Graves Otis developed the safety elevator, making skyscrapers possible.

The Fed responded by rushing money to banks, and markets partially calmed down, for a little while.
Last month another market you’ve never heard of, the $300 billion market for auction-rate securities (don’t ask), suffered the equivalent of a bank run.
Even Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant government-sponsored mortgage agencies long regarded as safe places to put your money, are now having trouble attracting funds.

One consequence of the crisis is that while the Fed has been cutting the interest rate it controls — the so-called Fed funds rate — the rates that matter most directly to the economy, including rates on mortgages and corporate bonds, have been rising.
And that’s sure to worsen the economic downturn.
What’s going on?
Mr. Geithner described a vicious circle in which banks and other market players who took on too much risk are all trying to get out of unsafe investments at the same time, causing “significant collateral damage to market functioning.”
A report released last Friday by JPMorgan Chase was even blunter.
It described what’s happening as a “systemic margin call,” in which the whole financial system is facing demands to come up with cash it doesn’t have.

The Fed’s latest plan to break this vicious circle is — as the financial Web site interfluidity.com cruelly but accurately describes it — to turn itself into Wall Street’s pawnbroker.
Banks that might have raised cash by selling assets will be encouraged, instead, to borrow money from the Fed, using the assets as collateral.
In a worst-case scenario, the Federal Reserve would find itself owning around $200 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities.
Some observers worry that the Fed is taking over the banks’ financial risk.
But what worries me more is that the move seems trivial compared with the size of the problem: $200 billion may sound like a lot of money, but when you compare it with the size of the markets that are melting down — there are $11 trillion in U.S. mortgages outstanding — it’s a drop in the bucket.
The only way the Fed’s action could work is through the slap-in-the-face effect: by creating a pause in the selling frenzy, the Fed could give hysterical markets a chance to regain their sense of perspective.
And to be fair, that has worked in the past.

But slap-in-the-face only works if the market’s problems are mainly a matter of psychology.
And given that the Fed has already slapped the market in the face twice, only to see the financial crisis come roaring back, that’s hard to believe.
The third time could be the charm.
But I doubt it.
Soon, we’ll probably have to do something real about reducing the risks investors face.
A plan to restore the credibility of municipal bond insurance would be a start (how crazy is it that New York State, rather than the federal government, is taking the lead here?).
I also suspect that the feds will have to get explicit about guaranteeing the debt of Fannie and Freddie, which really are too big to fail.
Nobody wants to put taxpayers on the hook for the financial industry’s follies; we can all hope that, in the end, a bailout won’t be necessary.
But hope is not a plan.

“I think what we’re seeing with the industrial companies is that there’s just more growing concern about the economic slowdown cutting into international industrial business,” Mr. Dickson said.
Recession concerns hit shares of big manufacturers, including the Boeing Company, which led the Dow’s decliners with a drop of $2.22, to $74.38.

“A sizable fraction of long-term assets — assets with exposure to different forms of credit risk—ended up in vehicles financed with very short-term liabilities,” Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last week in a speech.
“As is often the case during periods of rapid change, more significant concentrations of risk were present than was apparent at the time.”
That risk has come to the fore in the last several months, as several mortgage companies and smaller financial institutions have failed.
This week Carlyle Capital, a highly leveraged lender formed by the Carlyle Group, a private equity fund, collapsed.
Bear could not borrow directly from the Fed because it is not a commercial bank.
The Fed had seen such problems coming, and had announced plans this week to lend money to major dealers in Treasury securities — like Bear — by taking in as collateral mortgage securities that are now hard to sell.

The rescue of Bear is not permanent — the loans are for only a month — and there is an expectation that authorities will seek to arrange for Bear to be acquired, perhaps at a low price, or that it will be broken up and sold to more than one buyer.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Such an outcome could avoid systemic risk while leaving Bear’s top executives without jobs and perhaps deflecting criticism that they had not had to face the results of their mistakes.
But when investors do not have such confidence — as in Britain last year, where deposit insurance covered only the first £2,000, or about $4,000 — the rational response is to grab the money and ask questions later.
Mr. Schwartz, Bear’s chief, says his firm remains solvent.
But such assurances are seldom credited during panics.
As Walter Bagehot, the British financial journalist, wrote in “Lombard Street,” a 19th-century book on the monetary system, “Every banker knows that if he has to prove that he is worthy of credit, however good may be his arguments, in fact his credit is gone.”
At the bottom of the current crisis is a distrust of many financial institutions and securities that goes beyond Bear Stearns.
“This is a credit problem, not a liquidity problem,” said William L. Silber, a finance professor at New York University who has written about the 1933 crisis.
“The root question is,” he said, “Will mortgage borrowers be able to repay their debts?
That risk and that uncertainty is still there, and that has brought into question all sorts of credit exposure.” He argues that because that question cannot be resolved soon, in the end the Treasury will have to do as it did in 1933, and issue broad guarantees.
Whether or not that happens, the government may have to revise its regulatory system, which, as Mr. Geithner noted, has “evolved into a very complex and uneven framework, with substantial opportunities for arbitrage, large gaps in coverage, significant inefficiencies and large differences in the degree of oversight and restraint upon institutions that engage in very similar economic activities.”
He called for “a more uniform set of rules applied evenly across entities involved in similar functions,” and added that “institutions that are banks, or are built around banks, with special access to the safety net, need to be subject to a stronger form of consolidated supervision than our current framework provides.”

Friday’s Fed move shows that investment banks have that “special access to the safety net,” a fact that may lead to more regulation.
By the way, Mr. Greenspan is still at it: accepting no blame, he continues to insist that “market flexibility and open competition” are the “most reliable safeguards against cumulative economic failure.”

The result of all that bad lending was an unholy financial mess that will cause trillions of dollars in losses.
A large chunk of these losses will fall on financial institutions: commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and so on.
Many people say that the government should let the chips fall where they may — that those who made bad loans should simply be left to suffer the consequences.
But it’s not going to happen.
When push comes to shove, financial officials — rightly — aren’t willing to run the risk that losses on bad loans will cripple the financial system and take the real economy down with it.
Nobody expects an investment bank to be a charitable institution, but Bear has a particularly nasty reputation.
As Gretchen Morgenson of The New York Times reminds us, Bear “has often operated in the gray areas of Wall Street and with an aggressive, brass-knuckles approach.”
Bear was a major promoter of the most questionable subprime lenders.

But the Fed rode to Bear’s rescue anyway, fearing that the collapse of a major investment bank would cause panic in the markets and wreak havoc with the wider economy.
As Bear goes, so will go the rest of the financial system.
And if history is any guide, the coming taxpayer-financed bailout will end up costing a lot of money.
The U.S. savings and loan crisis of the 1980s ended up costing taxpayers 3.2 percent of G.D.P., the equivalent of $450 billion today.
— the equivalent of $3 trillion for the United States.
If these numbers shock you, they should.
But the big bailout is coming.
The only question is how well it will be managed.
That means cleaning out the shareholders in failed institutions, making bondholders take a haircut, and canceling the stock options of executives who got rich playing heads I win, tails you lose.

According to late reports on Sunday, JPMorgan Chase will buy Bear for a pittance.
resolution for this case — but not a model for the much bigger bailout to come.
Looking ahead, we probably need something similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation, which took over bankrupt savings and loan institutions and sold off their assets to reimburse taxpayers.
And we need it quickly: things are falling apart as you read this.
“Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen,” the Fed said in a statement that accompanied the rate decision.
Others surmised that the Fed might have been reluctant to cut rates further immediately in part because as the rates inch closer to zero, the Fed leaves itself less room to maneuver in case of further financial shocks.
The Fed’s statement and the vote highlighted a growing conflict about how to lift the economy out of a downturn while controlling inflationary pressures, which have become apparent in the falling value of the dollar and the prices of everything from energy to food.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has in recent weeks put top priority on propping up the economy, by both reducing interest rates and by unveiling a blizzard of emergency loan programs for cash-short banks and investment firms.
Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor who is close to Mr. Bernanke, has argued in several recent speeches that some indicators of inflation pressure, like the falling dollar or the yields on inflation-adjusted Treasury securities, are not as ominous as they might appear.
The two dissenters in Tuesday’s decision were Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed, both of whom have been outspokenly hawkish about inflation issues in recent months.

“I’m disappointed,” said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup.
“It’s not as if we’re trying to gauge policy priorities on a sunny day.
I’d like to know how you’re going to get inflation in an environment with suffocating financial restraint and pervasive slowing in demand.”
Mr. Bernanke, who took over as Fed chairman two years ago, has been more open to debate and dissent among policy makers than his most recent predecessor, Alan Greenspan.
Mr. Bernanke and other top Fed officials have acknowledged that consumer prices are rising faster than they would like, but they have predicted that inflation pressures will abate in part because of slowing economic growth.

In its statement on Tuesday, the Fed reiterated Mr. Bernanke’s prediction that inflation would probably “moderate” in the months ahead.
“I don’t take it seriously,” Mr. Harris said.
“The upside risks on inflation are actually very low.
The economy is really quite weak, and we are probably in a recession right now.
We’re just at the beginnings of a consumer slowdown.”

With the growing financial anxieties, economic concerns have replaced the war in Iraq as the dominant issue in the presidential campaign.
Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail have blasted President Bush, saying that he has responded too slowly and supported the bailout of banks and investment firms but not homeowners.

“I understand there’s short-term difficulty,” he told workers and local lawmakers in Jacksonville, Fla. “But I want people to understand that in the long term, we’re going to be just fine.
People will still be able to work.”
Without offering any details, Mr. Bush said the government would do more if necessary.
“The point I want to make to you is, if there needs to be further action we’ll take it — in a way that does not damage the long-term health of our economy.”
Many private economists contend that the economy has already slipped into a recession.
The Labor Department estimates that the nation lost 63,000 payroll jobs in February, the second straight month of job losses and the third month of job losses in the private sector.
But the Fed’s biggest worry in recent days has been on Wall Street, where investors have become so frightened about the rapidly deepening losses in mortgage-backed securities that credit markets have become increasingly paralyzed.
Mr. Bernanke has stunned investors over the past several weeks by unveiling a series of increasingly bold programs to lend hundreds of billions of dollars to banks and Wall Street investment firms.
But the Fed’s most powerful weapon against a slowdown is lower interest rates.
With the latest reduction, the federal funds rate is far below the rate of inflation, meaning that the “real,” or inflation-adjusted, interest rate is below zero.
It is also well below the European Central Bank’s benchmark interest rate of 4 percent or the Bank of England’s rate of 5.25 percent.
A lower federal funds rate usually leads to lower interest rates for commercial borrowing and for consumer loans like mortgages.

Mr. Bernanke has offered few hints about what the Fed might do if its current efforts fail to stabilize the markets or the economy.
Having already agreed to accept mortgage-backed securities and other securities as collateral for loans to banks and investment firms, the Fed could go one step further and start buying up hard-to-sell securities itself.
If the Federal Reserve feels compelled to reduce the fed funds rate even more, it would have to start grappling with the question of what to do if the rate declines to zero.
In 2003, when the overnight rate was heading to new lows, Mr. Bernanke himself suggested one possible course of action — the Fed could easily infuse more money into the economy by buying up billions of dollars in longer-term Treasury securities and perhaps even commercial bonds.
This banking crisis of the 1930s showed that unregulated, unsupervised financial markets can all too easily suffer catastrophic failure.

As the decades passed, however, that lesson was forgotten — and now we’re relearning it, the hard way.
To grasp the problem, you need to understand what banks do.
Banks exist because they help reconcile the conflicting desires of savers and borrowers.
Savers want freedom — access to their money on short notice.
Borrowers want commitment: they don’t want to risk facing sudden demands for repayment.
Normally, banks satisfy both desires: depositors have access to their funds whenever they want, yet most of the money placed in a bank’s care is used to make long-term loans.
The reason this works is that withdrawals are usually more or less matched by new deposits, so that a bank only needs a modest cash reserve to make good on its promises.
Photo
But sometimes — often based on nothing more than a rumor — banks face runs, in which many people try to withdraw their money at the same time.
And a bank that faces a run by depositors, lacking the cash to meet their demands, may go bust even if the rumor was false.
Worse yet, bank runs can be contagious.
If depositors at one bank lose their money, depositors at other banks are likely to get nervous, too, setting off a chain reaction.
And there can be wider economic effects: as the surviving banks try to raise cash by calling in loans, there can be a vicious circle in which bank runs cause a credit crunch, which leads to more business failures, which leads to more financial troubles at banks, and so on.
That, in brief, is what happened in 1930-1931, making the Great Depression the disaster it was.

In fact, however, we were partying like it was 1929 — and now it’s 1930.
The financial crisis currently under way is basically an updated version of the wave of bank runs that swept the nation three generations ago.
People aren’t pulling cash out of banks to put it in their mattresses — but they’re doing the modern equivalent, pulling their money out of the shadow banking system and putting it into Treasury bills.
And the result, now as then, is a vicious circle of financial contraction.
Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues at the Fed are doing all they can to end that vicious circle.
We can only hope that they succeed.
Otherwise, the next few years will be very unpleasant — not another Great Depression, hopefully, but surely the worst slump we’ve seen in decades.
Even if Mr. Bernanke pulls it off, however, this is no way to run an economy.
It’s time to relearn the lessons of the 1930s, and get the financial system back under control.
But financial analysts warn that they should take time to consider their options.
“Don’t do anything rash based on what you see in the news,” advises Greg Daugherty, executive editor of Consumer Reports, put out by Consumers Union.
“You will inevitably do something wrong.”

The first thing to do is take stock of your life.
Determine how secure your job is, which, in these uncertain times, may not be easy.
If your job is relatively safe, step back and look at your financial situation.
It may seem overwhelming, but there are a few basic steps everyone can take to achieve some peace of mind.
Since most banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, your accounts are insured up to $100,000.
In addition, most individual retirement accounts and Keogh retirement accounts held by those institutions are insured up to $250,000.
“The F.D.I.C.
is about as safe as it gets in this world,” Mr. Daugherty said.
Next, take a hard, realistic look at your debt.
It may be somewhat painful, but now is the time to ask some difficult questions.
Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst with Bankrate.com, suggests starting with these: Are you having trouble keeping up with your debt payments?
Are you relying on debt to keep up with your lifestyle?
Consumers, Mr. McBride said, have been drawing on credit in recent years, but some “are finding that the well has run dry.” He suggested that you “ask yourself whether you can honestly afford the lifestyle you’re living.”
A good indicator that things are going in the wrong direction, he said, is if your credit card balance has been rising in the last year but your savings balance has been falling.
“As interest rates are on the decline, it serves as a real tail wind to debt repayment,” Mr. McBride said.
“More of each dollar goes to principal rather than to the interest.
So each dollar goes further as interest rates fall.”
Now, what about investments?
First, experts say, consumers should confirm that their investments are covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, an independent organization set up by Congress in 1970.

If a brokerage firm or other insured firm fails, the investor corporation covers $500,000 of a customer’s assets, of which $100,000 can be claimed for cash.
Keep in mind that money market funds are securities, not cash, said Stephen P. Harbeck, president and chief executive of the S.I.P.C.
The good news is that membership is not voluntary; when a company registers with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it is required to be a member of the investor protection corporation.
Be sure, however, that when you make out a check to your broker, it goes to a member of the S.I.P.C., Mr. Harbeck said.
There are cases where corporate entities that are part of the same holding company are not members of the investor corporation.
You should ask brokers whether their firms are members, or you can check out members on the investor corporation’s Web site, www.sipc.org.
If your investments are in a company not covered, then you are not covered.
is a floor, not a ceiling; each investor also receives a prorated distribution of customer assets depending on how individual situations are resolved.
Since 2004, the corporation has stepped in only seven times to cover consumer losses, Mr. Harbeck said.

Brokers can buy additional insurance to cover higher amounts; ask your broker whether that is the case for your investments and request a copy of the agreement in writing.
Although many consumers’ first instinct may be to sell their stocks and move into bonds — or perhaps cash under the mattress — financial advisers generally agree that would be the wrong move.

David B. Tysk, a private wealth adviser with Ameriprise Financial, said the recent financial upheaval might offer some opportunities.
Too many people buy stocks when they are going up and sell when they are going down, he said.
“Small investors always make the worst timing decisions because emotion is involved,” Mr. Tysk said.
“This is precisely the wrong time to move to safer options.
The stock market has dropped dramatically and now is the time to invest — don’t close the stable door after the horse has left.”
Everyone agrees that diversification is crucial, but that does not mean the same thing for everybody.
Are you 24 and just starting to save for retirement?
Forty years old and saving for your children’s college education?
Or a retiree on a fixed income?
Mr. Bogle’s rule of thumb is that the allocation of bonds in your portfolio should be about 10 percentage points less than your age.
So if you are 60 years old, aim to have 50 percent in bonds.
“As you get older, you want more bonds; bonds produce income and time is less on your side to recoup losses,” he said.
He suggests half short-term bonds (one to two years) and half intermediate-term bonds (six to seven years).
When interest rates go up, so will the income on the short-term bonds.
“For taxable accounts, municipal bonds are extraordinarily attractive compared to Treasury bonds,” Mr. Bogle added.
For retirement accounts, like I.R.A.’s, “inflation is a big, big worry,” he said.
“Everybody should consider a significant holding of U.S. Treasury inflation bonds.”

Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, known as TIPS, are securities whose principal is tied to the Consumer Price Index.
With inflation, the principal increases, while with deflation, it decreases.
When the security matures, the United States Treasury pays the original or adjusted principal, whichever is greater.
Many analysts also encourage investors to diversify within the stock market in terms of domestic and overseas companies — Mr. Bogle suggests a split of 80 percent domestic and 20 percent foreign.
“We can’t control the future returns of the stock market, but think of what we can control.
Keep turnover to a minimum for tax efficiency and to reduce cost.
Ask tough questions of an adviser.”
Hard as it is to believe, there is an up side.
Consumers will eventually see lower rates on their credit cards, Mr. McBride said, although — not surprisingly — card issuers tend to pass along rate increases faster than decreases.
He said there is generally a three-month lag after the Fed lowers its federal funds rate.
In terms of home mortgages, the people who will benefit most are those who are resetting their adjustable-rate mortgages, Mr. McBride said, because rates on many of these home loans are tied to the one-year Treasury bill, which tends to move down as the Fed is cutting rates.
But, Mr. McBride warns, those looking to buy a house should focus on fixed-rate mortgages.
His advice sounds obvious, but many home buyers ignored it in recent years.
“If they can’t afford the payment on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, then they cannot afford a house,” he said.

Comics were selling between eighty million and a hundred million copies every week, with a typical issue passed along or traded to six to ten readers, thereby reaching more people than movies, television, radio, or magazines for adults.
By 1952, more than twenty publishers were producing nearly 650 comics titles per month, employing well over a thousand artists, writers, editors, letterers, and others — among them women such as Valleau, as well as untold members of racial, ethnic, and social minorities who turned to comics because they thought of themselves or their ideas as unwelcome in more reputable spheres of publishing and entertainment.
Comic books were radical among the books of their day for being written, drawn, priced, and marketed primarily for and directly to kids, as well as for asserting a sensibility anathema to grown-ups.

Most adults never paid much mind until the comics — and the kids reading them — began to change.
During the early postwar years, comic books shifted in tone and content.
Unlike the movies and the broadcast media, comic books had no effective monitoring or regulatory mechanism — no powerful self-censoring body like the film industry's Hays Office, no government authority like the FCC imposing content standards.
Uninhibited, shameless, frequently garish and crude, often shocking, and sometimes excessive, these crime, horror, and romance comics provided young people of the early postwar years with a means of defying and escaping the mainstream culture of the time, while providing the guardians of that culture an enormous, taunting, close-range target.
The world of comics became a battleground in a war between two generations, delineating two eras in American pop-culture history.
"Comic books are definitely harmful to impressionable people, and most young people are impressionable," said the psychiatrist Fredric Wertham, author of an incendiary tract, Seduction of the Innocent, which indicted comics as a leading cause of juvenile delinquency.
"I think Hitler was a beginner compared to the comic-book industry.
"The time has come to legislate these books off the newsstands and out of the candy stores."
Headlines in newspapers and magazines around the country warned readers: "Depravity for Children — Ten Cents a Copy!"
"Horror in the Nursery," "The Curse of the Comic Books."
Like Janice Valleau, the majority of working comics artists, writers, and editors — more than eight hundred people — lost their jobs.
A great many of them would never be published again.
Page-one news as it occurred, the story of the comics controversy is a largely forgotten chapter in the history of the culture wars and one that defies now-common notions about the evolution of twentieth-century popular culture, including the conception of the postwar sensibility — a raucous and cynical one, inured to violence and absorbed with sex, skeptical of authority, and frozen in young adulthood — as something spawned by rock and roll.
The truth is more complex.
It is clear now that the hysteria over comic books was always about many things other than cartoons: about class and money and taste; about traditions and religions and biases rooted in time and place; about presidential politics; about the influence of a new medium called television; and about how art forms, as well as people, grow up.

If the Fed were to reject the new proposal, it could set off a furor among shareholders of both firms that the government was preventing them from making a fair deal.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In an unusual move, Bear’s board was seeking to authorize the sale of 39.5 percent of the firm to JPMorgan in an effort to move closer to majority shareholder approval.
Under state law in Delaware, where the companies are incorporated, a company can sell up to 40 percent without shareholder approval.
The renegotiation, which would set a sale price of more than $1 billion, comes after a tumultuous week on Wall Street and in Washington because of the near collapse of Bear and the hastily devised deal to save it.
While the initial agreement appeared to have defused the financial crisis of confidence that undid Bear, the initial terms of the deal — and the government’s controversial role in reaching them — drew criticism from those who say the takeover amounts to a government bailout of Bear, a firm at the center of the mortgage meltdown.
A new deal could raise even more questions about the Fed’s involvement in the negotiations.
As part of the original deal, the Fed guaranteed to take on $30 billion of Bear’s most toxic assets.
The central bank also directed JPMorgan to pay no more than $2 a share for Bear to assure that it would not appear that the Bear shareholders were being rescued, according to people involved in the negotiations.
In television interviews last week, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who has been closely involved in the negotiations, sought to portray the agreement not as a rescue effort but as a way to provide stability for the entire financial markets.
“Let me say that the Bear Stearns situation has been very painful for the Bear Stearns shareholders,” Mr. Paulson said on Monday on the NBC “Today” show, referring to the $2 a share price.
“So I don’t think that they think that they’ve been bailed out here.”
If the price is increased, however, some critics could have more ammunition to complain that taxpayers are helping to bail out a Wall Street firm that should be responsible for its own risky behavior.
That is one reason the Fed was hesitant on Sunday night to approve the transaction at $10 a share, people briefed on the talks said.
A representative of Bear Stearns could not be reached.
Bear employees own more than a third of Bear’s stock, and many longtime employees faced the prospect of losing all their savings.
The new price would still be a small fraction of what Bear Stearns was worth before its recent meltdown.
Its shares were trading at about $67 two weeks ago and as high as $170 a year ago.
Even after JPMorgan announced that it would acquire Bear for $2 a share, investors bid up the stock to close at $5.96 on Friday in anticipation that a better deal would be reached.

Some of Bear’s largest shareholders have even considered voting down the deal to send the firm into bankruptcy protection, where they speculate they might get more than $2 a share from creditors.
The British billionaire financier Joe Lewis, the firm’s largest shareholder, who had invested $1.26 billion in Bear over the last year at an average price of about $104, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he would seek to block the deal by taking “whatever action” necessary and would “encourage” the firm and “third parties to consider other strategic transactions.”
He and James E. Cayne, Bear’s chairman, were talking informally to friends and others about finding investors to mount a rival bid.
If Bear’s board sells JPMorgan 39.5 percent of the firm, as it was attempting to do on Sunday night, that would leave JPMorgan needing only slightly more than 10.5 percent of shareholder support to complete the transaction.

Some shareholders could seek to file lawsuits to block the deal, claiming that the unusual board vote was an act of coercion.
However, the Fed may now be seeking to raise that number.
A major aim of a new agreement would be to provide assurances to investors who trade with Bear that it will continue to be open for business.
Even with JPMorgan’s original agreement in place last week, some of Bear’s largest customers would not trade with it, still nervous that the deal might unravel.
One sentence was “inadvertently included,” according to a person briefed on the talks, which requires JPMorgan to guarantee Bear’s trades even if shareholders voted down the deal.
That provision could allow Bear’s shareholders to seek a higher bid while still forcing JPMorgan to honor its guarantee, these people said.
He offered certain employees cash and stock incentives to stay on and made calls to his rival chief executives on Wall Street — John J. Mack at Morgan Stanley and John A. Thain at Merrill Lynch, among them — pleading with them not to recruit Bear employees during the transition.
Such vindictive behavior, they told him, would turn into a legal and public relations nightmare.

Last week, in an impassioned speech to Bear’s employees seeking their support, Mr. Dimon said: “No one on Wall Street could have anticipated this.
I feel terrible sometimes when people think we took advantage.
I don’t think we could possibly know what you all are feeling, but I hope that you give JPMorgan a chance.”
Any bailout needed to be for the overall system, and not for Bear shareholders — the “moral hazard” issue writ large.
Part of the shock over the price, he said, “was that so many people hadn’t figured out the reality.”
And the Fed is in the business of saving the financial system from evil, not saving fat cats from having to sell their wine collections, as one Bear executive apparently did last week.
Perhaps the Fed never set the exact price, but the notion that it didn’t press JPMorgan to pay as close to zero as possible doesn’t square with reality.
Mr. Paulson was desperate to demonstrate to Main Street that he wouldn’t rescue Wall Street on the government’s dime, even though that’s exactly what he did, by providing a $30 billion backstop to the deal.
(And he may have been right to do so.)

In effect, they revolted against the terms of the deal — and both JPMorgan and the Fed wound up having to mollify them by raising the price.
Had the deal died, Bear would once again be risking bankruptcy, and the market would once again be risking turmoil.
(Bear shareholders seem to think they still might have another chance, though, bidding its shares on Monday up to $11.26 a share.)
And they got a giveback — JPMorgan is on the hook for the first $1 billion in losses.
In an action almost unprecedented in takeover history, JPMorgan bought 39.5 percent of Bear on the spot to ensure that it would have close to a majority of the votes to approve the deal.
That agreement completely disregards New York Stock Exchange’s rules that prevent anyone from buying more than 20 percent of company without a shareholder vote.
Other parts of the new agreement either stretch the rules or disregard years of precedent in Delaware, where both banks are incorporated.
If that’s not deal-making, Fed style, what is?

Some of the biggest benefits came from choices that did not cost money per se, like having the front of the house face south to take maximum advantage of the sun.
It did not take long for the gamble to begin paying off.
A copy of the $8.45 check that Xcel Energy, the utility, sent to settle 2006 accounts sits framed on the dining room table.

Mr. Doub’s design for the Abramsons includes a combination of wind and solar power that is expected to generate 80 percent more energy than the house will require when it is finished early next year.
And, with strict attention to the materials used and their environmental impact, the Abramsons think they can balance their carbon dioxide emissions and reductions.
Carbon neutral or not, the Abramson home is the first to meet new Boulder County regulations that set a sliding scale of permitted energy use, based on size.
At the top of the scale, all new homes of more than 5,000 square feet must be energy neutral, generating as much as they use.
County officials credit Solar Harvest with drawing support for the new regulations.
Thus, Mr. Doub said, his work is in some respects less impressive than the single-story 1,130 square foot zero-energy home Habitat for Humanity built in 2005 in nearby Wheat Ridge with help from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Last fall, the family replaced its gas appliances with electric ones, partly to make Solar Harvest more representative of homes in the future.

“We were surprised because there has been all this talk about the financial crisis and how it would affect Germany,” said Klaus Abberger, a senior economist at the Ifo Institute in Munich.
These hopeful signs are likely to fortify the European Central Bank in its refusal to follow the recent rate cuts of the Federal Reserve.
The bank’s president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said on Wednesday that cutting rates in response to the financial crisis would only stoke inflation.
“The current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our price-stability objective,” Mr. Trichet said at the European Parliament in Brussels, taking note of the optimism in Germany.

In testimony before lawmakers in London, the bank’s governor, Mervyn A.
German businesspeople may be optimistic, but its bankers remain a fragile lot.
Deutsche Bank warned that further write-downs of assets, and the deterioration of the broader economy, meant that it could fall short of its target of pretax profits of 8.4 billion euros ($13.1 billion) in 2008.
The European Commission is also nervous about the broader economic fallout of the crisis.
Yet the commission still projects that exports will grow 5.3 percent in 2008, only modestly below their 5.8 percent growth rate last year.
“Europe’s resilience has improved, thanks to structural reforms over the last decade,” Klaus P. Regling, the director-general of economic and financial affairs for the commission, said in a roundtable interview.
“The vulnerability of Europe is less than it used to be,” said Mr. Regling, a German economist, “and therefore, we are optimistic that we can weather the problems better than in the past.”
Mr. McCain is often referred to as a “maverick” and a “moderate,” assessments based mainly on his engaging manner.

It’s true that the speech was more about what Mr. McCain wouldn’t do than about what he would.
His main action proposal, as far as I can tell, was a call for a national summit of accountants.
The whole tone of the speech, however, indicated that Mr. McCain has purged himself of any maverick tendencies he may once have had.
Many news reports have pointed out that Mr. McCain more or less came out against aid for troubled homeowners: government assistance “should be based solely on preventing systemic risk,” which means that big investment banks qualify but ordinary citizens don’t.
But I was even more struck by Mr. McCain’s declaration that “our financial market approach should include encouraging increased capital in financial institutions by removing regulatory, accounting and tax impediments to raising capital.”
These days, even free-market enthusiasts are talking about increased regulation of securities firms now that the Fed has shown that it will rush to their rescue if they get into trouble.
But Mr. McCain is selling the same old snake oil, claiming that deregulation and tax cuts cure all ills.

Hillary Clinton’s speech could not have been more different.
True, Mrs. Clinton’s suggestion that she might convene a high-level commission, including Alan Greenspan — who bears a lot of responsibility for this crisis — had echoes of the excessively comfortable relationship her husband’s administration developed with the investment industry.
But the substance of her policy proposals on mortgages, like that of her health care plan, suggests a strong progressive sensibility.
Maybe the most notable contrast between Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton involves the problem of restructuring mortgages.
Mr. McCain called for voluntary action on the part of lenders — that is, he proposed doing nothing.

But his proposals for aid to the victims of the current crisis, though significant, are less sweeping than Mrs. Clinton’s: he wants to nudge private lenders into restructuring mortgages rather than having the government simply step in and get the job done.
Mr. Obama also continues to make permanent tax cuts — middle-class tax cuts, to be sure — a centerpiece of his economic plan.
It’s not clear how he would pay both for these tax cuts and for initiatives like health care reform, so his tax-cut promises raise questions about how determined he really is to pursue a strongly progressive agenda.

All in all, the candidates’ positions on the mortgage crisis tell the same tale as their positions on health care: a tale that is seriously at odds with the way they’re often portrayed.
Mr. McCain, we’re told, is a straight-talking maverick.
But on domestic policy, he offers neither straight talk nor originality; instead, he panders shamelessly to right-wing ideologues.
Mrs. Clinton, we’re assured by sources right and left, tortures puppies and eats babies.
But her policy proposals continue to be surprisingly bold and progressive.
Finally, Mr. Obama is widely portrayed, not least by himself, as a transformational figure who will usher in a new era.
But his actual policy proposals, though liberal, tend to be cautious and relatively orthodox.
Do these policy comparisons really tell us what each candidate would be like as president?
Not necessarily — but they’re the best guide we have.
While the plan could expose Wall Street investment banks and hedge funds to greater scrutiny, it carefully avoids a call for tighter regulation.

The plan would not rein in practices that have been linked to the housing and mortgage crisis, like packaging risky subprime mortgages into securities carrying the highest ratings.
The plan would give the Fed some authority over Wall Street firms, but only when an investment bank’s practices threatened the entire financial system.
And the plan does not recommend tighter rules over the vast and largely unregulated markets for risk sharing and hedging, like credit default swaps, which are supposed to insure lenders against loss but became a speculative instrument themselves and gave many institutions a false sense of security.
Parts of the plan could reduce the power of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is charged with maintaining orderly stock and bond markets and protecting investors.
The plan would merge the S.E.C.
with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates exchange-traded futures for oil, grains, currencies and the like.
The blueprint also suggests several areas where the S.E.C.
should take a lighter approach to its oversight.
Among them are allowing stock exchanges greater leeway to regulate themselves and streamlining the approval of new products, even allowing automatic approval of securities products that are being traded in foreign markets.
The proposal began last year as an effort by Henry M. Paulson Jr., secretary of the Treasury, to make American financial markets more competitive against overseas markets by modernizing a creaky regulatory system.
His goal was to streamline the different and sometimes clashing rules for commercial banks, savings and loans and nonbank mortgage lenders.
“I am not suggesting that more regulation is the answer, or even that more effective regulation can prevent the periods of financial market stress that seem to occur every 5 to 10 years,” Mr. Paulson will say in a speech on Monday, according to a draft.
“I am suggesting that we should and can have a structure that is designed for the world we live in, one that is more flexible.”

Congress would have to approve almost every element of the proposal, and Democratic leaders are already drafting their own bills to impose tougher supervision over Wall Street investment banks, hedge funds and the fast-growing market in derivatives like credit default swaps.
But Mr. Paulson’s proposal for the Fed echoes ideas championed by Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
Both see the Fed overseeing risk across the entire financial spectrum, but Mr. Frank is likely to favor a stronger Fed role and to subject investment banks to the same rules that commercial banks now must follow, especially for capital reserves.

The Treasury plan would let Fed officials examine the practices and even the internal bookkeeping of brokerage firms, hedge funds, commodity-trading exchanges and any other institution that might pose a risk to the overall financial system.
That would be a significant expansion of the central bank’s regulatory mission.

In two unprecedented moves, the Fed engineered a marriage between JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, lending $29 billion to JPMorgan to prevent a Bear bankruptcy and a chain of defaults that might have felled much of the financial system.
For the first time since the 1930s, the Fed also agreed to let investment banks borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from its discount window, an emergency lending program reserved for commercial banks and other depository institutions.
But Mr. Paulson’s proposal would fall well short of the kind of regulation that Democrats have been proposing.
Mr. Frank and other senior Democrats have argued that investment banks and other lightly regulated institutions now compete with commercial banks and should be subject to similar regulation, including examiners who regularly pore over their books and quietly demand changes in their practices.
Prince III, then chairman of Citigroup.
Prince responded that Citigroup, as a bank holding company, would have been at a disadvantage because investment firms can operate with higher debt and lower capital reserves.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has taken a similar stance.
“Commercial banks continue to be supervised closely, and are subject to a host of rules meant to limit systemic risk,” Mr. Schumer wrote in an op-ed article on Friday in The Wall Street Journal.
“But many other financial institutions, including investment banks and hedge funds, are regulated lightly, if at all, even though they act in many ways like banks.”
Mr. Paulson’s proposal is likely to provoke bruising turf battles in Congress among agencies and rival industry groups that benefit from the current regulations.
In a nod to the debacle in mortgage lending, the administration proposed a Mortgage Origination Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of state governments in regulating mortgage brokers and protecting consumers.
The bulk of the proposal, however, was developed before soaring mortgage defaults set off a much broader credit crisis, and most of the proposals are geared to streamlining regulation.
This plan would consolidate a large number of regulators into roughly three big new agencies.
Bank supervision, now divided among five federal agencies, would be led by a Prudential Financial Regulator, which could send examiners into any bank or depository institution that is protected by either federal deposit insurance or other federal backstops.
It would eliminate the distinction between “banks” and “thrift institutions,” which are already indistinguishable to most consumers, and shut down the Office of Thrift Supervision.
Any effort to merge the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with the S.E.C.
is likely to provoke battles.

Yet another proposal would, for the first time, create a national regulator for insurance companies, an industry that state governments now oversee.
Administration officials argue that a national system would eliminate the inefficiencies of having 50 different state regulators, who have jealously guarded their powers and are likely to fight any federal encroachment.
Arthur Levitt, a former S.E.C.
Even though the S.E.C.’s powers might be reduced, Mr. Levitt said, the plan would create a broader agency to regulate business conduct in all financial services.
“I’m intrigued by the fact that it puts an emphasis on investor protection, and that it establishes an agency specifically for that purpose, which would operate across all markets.
I think that’s a very constructive first step.”
WASHINGTON — Federal housing agencies are moving closer to a possible plan to help homeowners caught between rising interest rates on their mortgages and falling home prices that preclude selling or refinancing to pay off those debts, officials said Saturday.
The plan centers on so-called negative equity certificates.
For such borrowers — whose debts exceed the resale value of their homes but who also had enough income to afford their payments before their mortgages reset to higher adjustable rates — government housing regulators would offer lenders a chance to refinance a new, smaller, federally insured mortgage.
In exchange, a lender would receive a negative equity certificate entitling the holder to a payback if real estate recovers and the home is sold for a price greater than the original mortgage.
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the financial services committee, has made a similar proposal.
Treasury officials, however, caution that the details and feasibility of the plan remain uncertain, in part because lenders have not shown much appetite for the idea.
It is also unclear how many borrowers would qualify.
In his speech, Mr. Paulson made clear that any such program would address only a small fraction of the millions of homes facing foreclosures because it would be open only to those who could afford their initial payments but had faced rising adjustable rates as well as plunging home values.
“Let me also emphasize that any homeowner who can afford his mortgage payment but chooses to walk away from an underwater property is simply a speculator,” Mr. Paulson said.
“Washington cannot create any new mortgage program to induce these speculators to continue to own these houses, unless someone else foots the bill.”

“The people who we seek to help are those who want to keep their homes but can’t afford the monthly payment” because of an adjustable rate mortgage reset, he continued.
“If they also have negative equity in their homes, refinancing becomes almost impossible, and so workouts become even more important.”
An estimated nine million households own a home worth less than its mortgage debt, in part because at the peak of the housing boom lenders often required little or no down payment — in other words, a mortgage for 100 percent of the purchase price, putting the home under water as soon as prices declined.
Many if not most of those nine million households can afford to keep making their payments to avoid foreclosure, something homeowners typically fight to avoid even when their house is worth less than their mortgage.
But the problem is that some lenders also extended mortgages with interest payments stretching the limits of the borrowers’ ability to pay.
But now the hangover is deepening the price declines as the resulting wave of foreclosures threatens to glut the market.
Lenders could participate voluntarily, and the program would apply only to borrowers with the ability to meet the new payments.
“We anticipate a market would develop for these negative equity certificates,” Mr. Ruberry said.
Mr. Dith, portrayed by Dr. Haing S. Ngor (who won an Academy Award as best supporting actor), insisted on staying in Cambodia with Mr. Schanberg to keep reporting the news.
But despite his frantic effort, Mr. Schanberg could not keep Mr. Dith from being sent to the countryside to join millions working as virtual slaves.
After more than four years of beatings, backbreaking labor and a diet of a tablespoon of rice a day, Mr. Dith escaped over the Thai border on Oct. 3, 1979.
“To all of us who have worked as foreign reporters in frightening places,” Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times, said on Sunday, “Pran reminds us of a special category of journalistic heroism — the local partner, the stringer, the interpreter, the driver, the fixer, who knows the ropes, who makes your work possible, who often becomes your friend, who may save your life, who shares little of the glory, and who risks so much more than you do.”
Mr. Dith moved to New York and in 1980 became a photographer for The Times, where he was noted for his imaginative pictures of city scenes and news events.
You have to have a hundred eyes.”
“I’m a very lucky man to have had Pran as my reporting partner and even luckier that we came to call each other brother,” Mr. Schanberg said.
My reporting could not have been done without him.”

Outside The Times, Mr. Dith spoke out about the Cambodian genocide, appearing before student groups and other organizations.
“I’m a one-person crusade,” he said.
Tourism ended.
When working for Mr. Schanberg, he taught himself to take pictures.
For sustenance, people ate insects and rats and even the exhumed corpses of the recently executed, he said.

The Vietnamese made him village chief.
Mr. Dith is survived by his companion, Bette Parslow; his daughter, Hemkarey; his sons, Titony, Titonath and Titonel; a sister, Samproeuth; six grandchildren; and two stepgrandchildren.
Ms. DePaul now runs the Dith Pran Holocaust Awareness Project, which spreads word about the Cambodian genocide.
At his death, Mr. Dith was working to establish another, still-unnamed organization to help Cambodia.
“One time is too many,” he said in an interview in his last weeks, expressing hope that others would continue his work.
“If they can do that for me,” he said, “my spirit will be happy.”
The election has become a litmus test of the national political mood and an important referendum on Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s wavering Labor government.
Winning London, a Labor stronghold, would be a significant gain for the opposition Conservatives, who have been out of power nationally for 11 years.

“It’s a war by proxy,” said Tony Travers, director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics.
“If Livingstone loses, the Conservatives will say: ‘Look, you can’t even hold on to the capital city.
You’re doomed, an ex-government.’ But if Livingstone wins, Labor will say, ‘So much for the Tory revival — you people are hopeless.’ ”
The issues are similar to those in any big city: crime, transportation, development versus the environment, the steep cost of living.
But in London, which has had an elected mayor for only eight years, the race is turning in large part on personality.
Mr. Livingstone, 62, a wily politician from the far left of the Labor Party, has made as many enemies as friends with his uncompromising, sometimes abrasive manner.
Probably his biggest achievement has been to introduce a $16-a-day congestion charge on cars driving in central London, the most ambitious program of its kind in the world.
Then there is Mr. Johnson (full name: Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson), 43, a former editor of the magazine The Spectator and an occasional host of a popular satirical television program, who has joked his way through his career, even as it has wafted upward.
With his bright flaxen hair, baroque rhetorical style and habit of bumbling into humiliating scrapes from which he somehow emerges a renewed man, Mr. Johnson is a creature apart from Britain’s gray, chronically self-editing politicians.
That has become the central question in the campaign: can Boris, as he is universally known, turn his reputation around?
Is he a plausible potential mayor, or simply a “fogeyish, bigoted and upper-class twit,” as Hazel Blears, a government minister, recently called him?

Mr. Johnson’s efforts to project seriousness of purpose and a common touch appear to be paying off.
He has been campaigning across London, producing dense, well-researched positions — fed to him by the Tory apparatus, his Labor opponents say — and talking fluently about topics like subway financing and bus flow.
“If you look at our agenda, I don’t think you could contest the seriousness of the job or what we are trying to accomplish,” Mr. Johnson said at the market, sampling a piece of sausage from a vendor.
“Because if you don’t take yourself seriously, you’re not taking anyone else seriously.”

However, even if each candidate looks new and improved, neither can escape his past.
Mr. Johnson, for instance, has an almost Prince Philip-like talent for offending people.
“My friends, as I have discovered myself, there are no disasters, only opportunities,” he said.
“But he’s put it on.
He’s never been a particularly serious person, and he’s not a true Londoner.”
At the market, Mr. Johnson doggedly pressed on.
“Yes, some kind of bag!” he responded, before remembering the party line, that plastic bags are bad for the environment.
“No, we’re antibag,” he said.
“We’re going to hold it.”
He glanced at his entourage, already laden with various Boris-accrued items, and edited himself again.
“We’re going to find a team of porters to hold it.”
His aides kept a close eye on him.
“Boris is off drink until the election is over,” said one, cutting off a vendor who tried to give Mr. Johnson a cup of alcohol-laced cider.
“He bumbles a lot, but he’s a lot cleverer than you think,” said Lizzie Vines, a 50-year-old Devon farmer.
“It’s a very British thing to do, to pretend to be stupid when you’re not.”
She said she liked his honesty.
What about the adultery?
She replied: “Cheating on your wife?
That’s a very British thing to do, too.”

“There’s a ‘hooray’ from the stands, but investors don’t realize the bench has been weakened,” she said.
“There’s no end in sight in terms of bad news.”
Indeed, a report issued Tuesday by Morgan Stanley concluded that investment banks face their worst crisis in 30 years, surpassing the global financial upheavals of 1998 as well as the stock market crash of 1987.
It projected that investment banking revenue will drop another 20 percent this year, and financial firms will report a further $75 billion in markdowns on top of what they have announced so far.
“What we’re in the process of doing is putting in a bottom,” he added.
“If we’re in recession, why is unemployment 5 percent?
Why are 80 percent of nonfinancial companies in the S.& P. 500 still achieving double-digit earnings gains?” he said, referring to the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.
“Does it mean all the problems are behind us?
No.
But it suggests the market is willing to look past the valley to some degree.”

From a high last October of 1,565 to its low of 1,273 last month, the S.& P. 500 fell 19 percent.
That is close to the 20.5 percent median decline stocks have experienced over the last nine recessions, Mr. Levkovich said.
Even so, enormous losses keep piling up.

UBS’s financial woes caused another casualty, however, in its executive suite.
Now, with Mr. Ospel’s departure, UBS has joined American giants like Merrill Lynch and Citigroup in cleaning house at the top.
UBS said its general counsel, Peter Kurer, would succeed Mr. Ospel.
Lehman Brothers, the investment firm hit by worries about its ability to weather the downturn, is already close to raising $4 billion in fresh funds from investors.
That is far more than the $3 billion it said it would seek, which analysts read as evidence of confidence in its future.
Financial stocks in Europe, including those of UBS, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale, as well as those of their American counterparts — including Lehman, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs — surged Tuesday.
While the willingness of investors to put up fresh cash for Lehman and UBS underscores that they are in a stronger position than Bear Stearns, which was forced to sell itself to JPMorgan last month, the mortgage mess remains a threat.

Not only are tens of billions in troubled home loans that remain on the books of banks hard to value, but potential buyers for these assets have evaporated in recent months amid fears that a recession in the United States might threaten swaths of the credit market that were previously thought to be safe.
“Everyone is trying to kitchen-sink this thing, but it’s hard to do so without knowing the ultimate level of credit losses,” said Josh Rosner, a managing director of Graham Fisher, an independent consulting firm in New York.
What is more, delinquency rates are now rising even among homeowners who qualified for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered companies that guarantee the bulk of mortgages in the United States.
So the problems facing ordinary homeowners, as well as the big banks that hold their mortgages, could still worsen, according to Mr. Rosner.
“In any bear market you have relief rallies, and that’s what we’re embracing,” he said.
It owns another $16 billion in Alt-A mortgages, which are loans to borrowers with credit that is slightly better but still shaky.
“We were compelled to announce further heavy losses, but at the same time we have been able to show our investors and shareholders a clear way out of this crisis,” UBS’s chief executive, Marcel Rohner, said in a conference call Tuesday, referring to the plans to raise $15 billion.
“The next chapter is one of discipline and determination.”
The planned capital increase would come on top of a $13 billion infusion UBS received from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and an unidentified Middle Eastern investor this year.
UBS’s problems of the last year are a stunning reversal for an institution long known for its staid, conservative style.
Beginning in 2005, UBS made a huge bet on mortgage securities, seeking the higher yields they offered and trusting that the AAA ratings they bore would protect the bank from outsize losses.

Eventually, UBS’s mortgage portfolio topped $100 billion.
“The losses at UBS are staggering,” Ms. Whitney of Oppenheimer said.
“It’s hard to fathom another quarter of $18 billion or $19 billion write-downs, but this isn’t the end of their problems.”
As for the broader market, over the next few weeks investors will closely follow companies’ first-quarter earnings announcements, looking for any sign of the recession that many economists believe is now under way.
Sharp swings in the stock market have been a hallmark of trading this year, reflecting the deep split on Wall Street between bulls like Mr. Paulsen and bears like Mr. Rosner.
Wall Street turned lower Wednesday as investors worried about how a sharp jump in oil prices would affect consumers in an economy that is already showing signs of a recession.
That could lead to higher prices at the pump, a troublesome trend given that retail gas prices are expected to rise further as summer nears.
“Higher gasoline price would mean less in the pocket for Americans, and there’s also continued worries about a recession.”
The credit crisis and weak economy have sent stocks tumbling over the last six months.
But the shares shot up nearly 400 points on Tuesday on growing sentiment that the worst of the credit problems might be behind Wall Street.
The Dow Jones industrials fell 48.53 points, or 0.38 percent, to 12,605.83, after changing direction several times.

Though many economists have said they believed a recession was under way, Fed officials generally are cautious when describing the economy.
Two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth is the traditional definition of a recession, so that one can be declared only in hindsight.
Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.60 percent, from 3.56 percent.
Most tourists driving south out of Tucson stop at a strikingly designed Native American casino, a couple of Spanish Colonial Mission churches, or the arts and crafts center in Tubac.
Many are going to Nogales, where they can park and then walk across the border for a day trip to Nogales, Mexico.

For the more adventurous, though, there are any number of tiny, funky towns surrounded by a visual feast of high desert, mountains and rolling grasslands.
There are ghost towns, and living towns that seem to be on their way to becoming ghost towns.
It’s a place for lovers of deserts who crave the yelp of coyotes at night, a fading hippie haven that serves up stirring vistas of a kind of Southwestern heaven.
The entire loop can be driven in a day if you don’t linger.
But the region is full of hiking trails and other temptations like bird watching and bar-hopping.
Plus, a more relaxed two- or three-day trip allows time to hang out at the local coffee shop or general store and meet the people who give these towns their quirks, charm and funk.

One warning: The border area of southern Arizona is ground zero for drug smuggling and illegal immigration.
Many back roads, especially near Arivaca, should be avoided after dark.
It’s also open range country, so watch out for wandering cattle.
Arivaca, with its rustic wooden buildings and commercial emphasis on ceramics, art, yoga, meditation and herbal remedies, is like traveling back to the late 1960s and early 1970s, except the hippies are grayer and heavier.
About 1,200 people now live in and around Arivaca.
Mary Noon Kasulaitis is a local historian and the librarian at the Caviglia-Arivaca Library; she has deep roots in Arivaca.
“By buying up mining claims, which many of them did in California Gulch, you could get cheap private land protected by national forest land.
He roasts and sells about 1,000 pounds of coffee beans a week.
He came to live in California Gulch in the early 1970s after organizing chapters of Students for a Democratic Society in Texas and Oklahoma and later selling flowers in Tucson.
He is a Libertarian and a Tibetan Buddhist.
He ran for state mining inspector on the Libertarian ticket in 1982, getting 5 percent of the vote.
“Arivaca is a place where you can do your own thing with no interference from others,” Mr.
Shook said, stroking his long, ZZ Top-style beard.
“I don’t look back; I live in the present.
Hell, I never thought I’d make it to 30.
It’s a real thrill to be looking at 60.”
FROM Arivaca to Sasabe, the road cuts through the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, which is well worth a stop.
The refuge has a permanent herd of about 60 pronghorn antelope and is popular with bird watchers and hikers.
The refuge also operates the Arivaca Cienega, on the east side of Arivaca.
It’s a rare desert wetland — featuring a two-mile handicap-accessible trail — fed by a spring that makes it a haven for migratory birds; it also attracts local critters like coyotes and deer.
Photo
Sasabe is an eye blink of a town of about 30 residents, with a post office and a general store that sells everything from gasoline to clothes to shots of tequila — there’s a bar in the back room.
The town is also the site of one of the smallest border-crossing facilities.
Some 150 cars come through each day, and the crossing is closed at night.
As you backtrack to Arivaca, heading for the Interstate and Patagonia, you may be tempted to take what looks on the map like a shortcut to Nogales.
It’s called Ruby Road and runs southeast out of Arivaca past California Gulch and Ruby, one of the best-preserved ghost towns in Arizona.
Despite the temptation, avoid Ruby Road unless you have a high-clearance vehicle or an S.U.V.
— and the weather is dry.
It is no shortcut timewise, though it runs through stunning reaches of the Coronado National Forest.

Patagonia is an old mining and railroad town of about 900 — the train station has been transformed into a town hall — that is a bit more trendy and accessible than some others of these towns.
With a well-run visitors center, it takes extra steps to cater to tourists and welcome retirees.
Don’t miss the Wagon Wheel Saloon, a popular late-afternoon gathering place whose walls have no shortage of antlers, horseshoes and vintage firearms.
It’s a spot that’s agreeable to the novelist and poet Jim Harrison, who has maintained a winter home in Patagonia for 17 years.
Mr. Harrison, whose works include “Legends of the Fall” and “The Shape of the Journey,” his collected poems, was taking an afternoon break from editing the proofs of his new novel, “The English Major,” which is scheduled to be published in October.
MR. Harrison says he likes Patagonia because of its sparse population and proximity to Mexico.
Both here and in Montana, where I live in the warm months, I can’t see any neighbors.
So I don’t have to think about the population explosion.
And I like Latino culture.”

Mr. Harrison is a legendary eater and drinker who manages to keep up that tradition in Patagonia.
“I don’t suffer for lack of good food out here,” he added as he downed icy vodka.
“I’m a cook myself.” He orders specialty foods via FedEx and every two weeks drives up to Tucson for what he can’t get locally.
From Patagonia, it’s an easy high-country, open-sky drive to Sonoita, an affluent region full of ranches and retirement homes that sit on lots as big as small farms.
There’s also a network of wineries complete with wine-tasting rooms.
Southern Arizona’s best wines tend to be from varieties of grapes that grow in the Mediterranean region, especially grenache, mourvèdre and tempranillo.
Visitors come to catch glimpses of elegant trogons, elf owls, sulfur-bellied flycatchers and painted redstarts.
If you’re not up to clambering over steep trails looking for birds, there’s a big feeding station with nearby benches.
Just sit still, and many of the birds will come to you — kind of like the Border Patrol helicopter that came to us.
VISITOR INFORMATION
YOU seldom need specific street addresses and directions in these small southern Arizona towns.
Most places stand out in an obvious way and sit on one of the few streets in town.
It is, however, a good idea to call ahead; posted hours are sometimes more goal than reality.
If you use Green Valley as a base, there is a Holiday Inn Express (520-625-0900) at Exit 69 off Interstate 19, as well as a Best Western (520-625-2250) and a Baymont Inns and Suites (520-399-3736) at Exit 65.
The Holiday Inn’s rates for a double begin at $96 with advance booking; Best Western’s begin at $79.95; Baymont’s rates begin at $99.
In Patagonia, the Duquesne House (357 Duquesne Avenue; 520-394-2732) is a well-regarded bed-and-breakfast.
A former rooming house for miners, built in 1898, its rooms are $125 a night and include breakfast.
The Patagonia Visitors Information Center (888-794-0060) on McKeown Avenue can help you find lodging.
For those with vehicles that can handle the Ruby Road and who want to visit the ghost town of Ruby, it’s best to call in advance (520-744-4471) for hours of operation.
There is a caretaker and a $12 entrance fee.

The Gadsden Coffee Company (520-398-3251; www.gadsdencoffee.com) in Arivaca is a local hangout where you can also get sandwiches and pastries.
Shelby’s Bistro (520-398-8075) in Tubac is a popular spot for lunch (every day) and dinner (Wednesday through Saturday) with a Southwestern flair.
Lunch entrees are $9 to $18 and dinner entrees are $9 to $33.
Signature dishes include Southwest bouillabaisse and lavender-rubbed grilled chicken breast stuffed with Gorgonzola.
Another popular place to eat is the Longhorn Grill (520-398-3955) in Amado at the Arivaca Road exit of I-19.
The entrance is through a giant Texas longhorn’s skull.
Open every day, the Longhorn’s prices are moderate, with lunch entrees from $8 to $10 and dinner entrees from $12 to $19.
The owner describes the fare — steaks, as well as Mexican and Italian dishes — as “spaghetti western.”
For wine tasters, a good place to start is Dos Cabezas Wine Works (3248 Highway 82; 520-455-5141; www.doscabezaswinery.com) in Sonoita.
For $5, you get a glass and a taste of six wines.
Hours are 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Friday, Saturday and Sunday only.
Information about foreign currency — and ways to purchase it online through certificates of deposit and exchange-traded funds and notes — has never been more available.
That can raise expectations, says Paul Karger, a managing partner of Twin Focus Capital Partners, a money management firm in Boston.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Karger said he remembered an e-mail message from a high-net-worth client wanting to know why his cash was not in three-month Icelandic krona CDs paying over 11 percent interest.
“People could start dumping the krona, and when he converted his CD back into dollars, he could wind up losing money.”
In late March, Iceland’s central bank, facing a credit crisis, raised interest rates to 15 percent to dissuade investors from selling the krona — precisely the situation Mr. Karger was concerned about.
Still, some experts think there is a place for foreign currencies in an average investor’s portfolio.
Adrian Day, chief executive of Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis, Md., argued that investing in foreign currency can be part of a broader strategy to defend against what he views as a fundamentally weak dollar.
Investors can purchase select foreign stocks and bonds, he said.
They can buy stock in American companies with strong global sales.
And they can hold some foreign currency.
“It should be seen not as a short-term investment that will make you rich, but as long-term insurance to hedge a weak dollar,” Mr. Day said.
The best time to buy foreign currency is when traders and investors are buying the dollar, in so-called dollar rallies, which may last up to six weeks, he added.
That is when investors get the most foreign currency for their dollar.
“Novice buyers must consider what they are doing and their time frame,” Mr. Day said.
“The danger is you freak out and sell after your first decline.
You need to know why you are buying, then hold your position.”
The cost of investing in foreign currencies is higher than that of buying a regular CD or exchange-traded fund.
Investors in foreign currency CDs pay to convert back into dollars, as well as penalties for unwinding their positions early.
Investors in currency exchange-traded funds pay higher expense ratios than most exchange-traded fund investors.

Sophisticated traders with a lot of money sometimes buy foreign currency with a higher interest rate and simultaneously go into the futures market to sell it forward — meaning they contract to sell the same amount of currency at a specific price at a later date.
In the parlance of such trading, that is a “single play.” The traders are insulated from a loss if the exchange rate moves against them, though they still reap the interest, said Peter Orr, a retired bond dealer living in Panama and Salt Lake City.
A “double play” — also known as an “open” or “naked” trade — is not hedged, which makes it both riskier and potentially more lucrative.
“Here you’re profiting from the foreign currency’s higher interest rate plus the exchange rate as it appreciates against the dollar,” Mr. Orr explained in an e-mail message.
But success depends upon the foreign currency’s continued strength.
About two years ago, Mr. Orr, an Australian who keeps a close watch on his native country’s economy, decided that going naked in the Australian dollar was a “no-brainer,” he wrote.
“My strategy was the Aussie dollar would appreciate toward par with the United States dollar, so I would be making 6 percent on the Australian one-year treasury bills, plus a huge appreciation — from 72 U.S. cents on the Aussie dollar to, say, 90 cents.”

Unfortunately, Mr. Orr said, he could not find a bank in Panama that would sell him Australian dollars.
Today, each one is worth about 94 United States cents, and most Australian one-year treasuries pay 6.25 percent, he wrote.
Mr. Orr advised currency buyers to research foreign nations and their credit risks, determine at the start their own risk-reward ratio and tolerance to volatility, and have exit strategies, while watching their positions constantly.
Walt McManus, a real estate investor and former banker based in Towson, Md., said investing in foreign currency requires research and passion.
In Fort Worth, Dr. Jim Nickerson has managed his own money since retiring from dentistry and oral surgery in 1986.
The shares began rising steadily in July.
“I saw a significant reversal of direction, and I didn’t want to give up those profits,” said Dr. Nickerson, who during market hours had been checking the shares’ real-time quotes every 15 minutes since buying them.
“I pulled the trigger and took an $18,750 profit.”

Creative thinking and being in the right place at the right time helped Julie Moeller make a triple play on foreign currency and real estate.
While Ms. Moeller’s investments are more diversified today, she remains enthusiastic about foreign currency.
Having never traded it, she experimented early this year, buying $20,000 worth of shares in the Rydex yen exchange-traded fund.
According to Mr. Orr, foreign currency is extremely risky now in the midst of a “giant credit squeeze” and derivative problems that are sending many investors scurrying for the safety of Treasury notes.
“My experience tells me that one needs to slow down now, and keep the powder dry,” he wrote.
Even those sternly warning average investors away from foreign currency do make exceptions.
“But the interesting thing about the yuan-dollar exchange is China’s central bank controls the yuan, and they’re allowing it to appreciate by decree, rather than by market forces.”
According to one carbon calculator, my round-trip journey between London and Sydney alone (about 21,000 miles) would produce an outlandish 5.6 tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of leaving all the lights on in my home all day and night for two years and six months.
And though air travel accounts for only 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, according to figures from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is the fastest-growing contributor to global warming.
With such an earth-shattering (literally) equation staring back at me, it was hard not to think twice before flying.

But when I read in September that Qantas Airways had begun a carbon offset program, I began wondering if I could justify a January trip across the world if I paid for my emissions and then, once there, traveled responsibly (no internal flights or rental cars) and delicately (staying only in green hotels, eating locally grown food and so on).
In fact, for a one-time payment of 24.02 Australian dollars to Qantas (about $21.50 at 1.12 Australian dollars to the U.S. dollar), I could offset my entire trip (including a fuel stop in Bangkok) by contributing to an Australian government-accredited “greenhouse gas abatement” program.
It seemed a ridiculously small amount to pay for a ludicrously long trip (19 hours of flight time), but at least I would be preventing my carbon footprint from growing any larger, even if I wasn’t reducing it by staying home.
And though many feel offsetting — whether it is planting forests or financing green initiatives in the developing world — is just a fashionable way for vacationers to feel less guilty about traveling, it still seemed better than doing nothing.
“Certainly, the goal is for everyone to try and fly less each year by finding alternative means of transport, particularly on short-haul distances,” said Mr. Francis, who used to work at the Body Shop for Anita Roddick, one of the first eco-leaders of the corporate world.
“But when you have no choice but to fly, be sure to offset,” he said, adding that until “greener” airline fuel is developed we have little alternative.
Mr. Francis went on to assuage my guilt by telling me that one in 12 jobs in the world is in tourism, and if everyone decided not to travel, the result would be a global recession that would undoubtedly hit the developing countries hardest, and not just their economies.
“Tourism also keeps many cultures from going extinct,” he said.
“Often rituals and traditions are passed down between generations primarily because tourists come to see them.” I vowed to learn something about the Aborigines if I went to Australia.
Set into the landscape overlooking one of the Blue Mountains’ seven national parks, the Jemby-Rinjah is surrounded by signposted trails for hiking (along with raised planked walkways to protect the flora and fauna from human impact), an eco-lodge with a dining room and circular stone fireplace, and plenty of visible wildlife, including possums and parrots.
What’s more, it is just outside the village of Blackheath, and not far from the area’s other two towns, Katoomba and Leura, filled with shops, pubs, boutiques and cafes for occasional breaks from the bush — something I thought we might need.
I must have looked equally troubled when, in a burst of enthusiasm, my friend signed us up for a guided hike into the Grand Canyon (forget his arachnophobia; my fear is heights!).
(Again.)
Without him, I am certain we would have ended up as one of the many “rescue” statistics he kept quoting during our trek.
Apparently more than a hundred people a year have to be pulled out of the Blue Mountains’ wilderness because of twisted ankles, dehydration or disorientation (for this reason there are cellphone signals in the park).
I now understood why the lodge instructs guests to inform a member of the staff before leaving for a hike.
(The miracle of nature at work!)
We were just going for a hike — strenuous enough, believe me — but other visitors come to the Grand Canyon, and nearby spots like the Valley of the Waters, for more adventurous diversions, like rappelling down the steep, slippery surface of a mountainside and then floating or swimming in the cool waters of the canyon streams.
But the history of the canyon is a fascinating one, and I was happy to hear it as we walked along the rocky path.
Then, in 1907, Thomas Rodriguez, Blackheath’s rail station master, began the arduous process of creating walking trails, complete with the rock steps we were now negotiating on our trek.

Once deposited in Katoomba, we followed the flock of tourists, both Australian and foreign, down the town’s main street to Echo Point, one of the country’s most visited places, as evidenced by the many buses rolling in and the number of cameras clicking.
The eucalyptus trees covering the park disperse oil into the atmosphere that emanates a blue hue, almost like a misty halo, when lit by the sun.

But it is the natural monument called the Three Sisters — three spires carved from millions of years of erosion of sandstone cliffs — that is the most awe-inspiring feature of the Blue Mountains.
They jut dramatically into the sky, looking like three queens admiring their realm.
Wanting a closer look at the spires, we headed into the bustling visitor center for some much needed advice, then headed off for a hike along Prince Henry Cliff Walk, which hugs the side of the mountains and gives spectacular views of the valley below.
For about half an hour, water bottles in hand, we weaved past cascades and waterfalls before emerging on a busy street leading back into town.
There, just another few minutes’ walk away, was a much-appreciated pub.
Sitting outdoors on the terrace filled with both young and old backpackers, all fresh (or not so fresh) from the mountain trails, we quickly polished off a couple of beers before stopping in for dinner at the Savoy, a casual restaurant with modern Oz food.
(Though my friend was still irritated by the faint glow emanating from the solar-powered lights in his room.)
Walking out to the designated feeding area, we saw a small group of people all standing with their arms extended like scarecrows, their palms turned up to the sky.
Waiting.
And then waiting some more.
“Are you a bird-watcher?” I asked him.
“Are you kidding?” he said, as a few gang-gang cockatoos landed on him.
This is the first time I’ve ever fed a bird.”
Moments later, I giggled as I felt the peck of a beak on my hand for the first time.
Squatting down, he was surrounded by a whole flock of feeding, flapping birds, looking a lot like Dr. Dolittle.

Playing in the major leagues is no breeze.
That’s where China is after the remarkable transformation that led to the hosting of the Olympics.
No talk of “peaceful rise,” “harmony,” “multilateralism” - self-effacing Chinese buzzwords all - can hide that a global power must make tough calls, decide what it represents, and be judged.

China can no longer pretend to be the unobtrusive power par excellence, in contrast to American intrusiveness.
In Burma and beyond, that just won’t wash.
President George W. Bush has called President Hu Jintao twice since the troubles began to urge him to reach out to the Dalai Lama, stop vilifying him, establish a dialogue, and open Tibet to foreign journalists.
“I don’t really expect anything good over the next few months,” he said.
Hu, who crushed protests in Tibet as party chief there in 1989, typifies the national consensus that China has delivered Tibetans from feudalism, ushering them toward modernity with infrastructure and investment.
Tibet, in this view, should be grateful, and the region’s obstinate “splittists” crushed.
At the Williamsburg Conference here, an annual high-level get-together on Asian themes, I did not hear one word from Chinese delegates that deviated from the view that outside agitators have stirred up the Tibet protests, that foreign media are mendacious or malevolent, that lectures on human rights are unacceptable, and that no government can tolerate a separatist movement.
“But it would be a terrible mistake to politicize the Olympics.
Everyone will be hurt.
The people of Tibet were serfs and have made huge progress.”
I don’t dispute the feudal aspects of Tibetan society.
I’d be surprised if there were not seditious plans hatched outside Tibet.
But the Chinese authorities need to face some greater truths.

These include the facts that a half-century of repression has not worked; that the Dalai Lama is the most moderate Tibetan interlocutor they will find; that he has called for autonomy but not independence; and that he is a revered global figure.

Rather than decry foreign plots, China should also recognize that the mass arrival of Han Chinese has fed legitimate Tibetan fears of cultural extinction, and that a stop-go approach to allowing foreign journalists into Tibet is ham-fisted.
For a long time the core question about China has been whether a dictatorship with an open market economy can resist its internal contradictions.
The core question now is how you federalize a diverse society under one-party control.
Or, as Raja Mahan, an Indian political scientist, put it to me: “In a country that does not separate party and state, how do you create the space for different peoples to express themselves?”
Democratic India is V. S. Naipaul’s land of “a million mutinies.” Each mutiny is a safety valve.
“But China cannot afford even one mutiny,” Mahan noted.
China’s Communist party leadership has proved remarkably adept at adjusting to the country’s explosive growth.
But in crisis it is not nimble.
The next few months will present a number of crises that I see, at root, as challenges to the fashionable authoritarian-capitalist model.
Bush is right to attend the Olympic opening ceremony.
Boycotting it would only accentuate old Chinese feelings of victimization.
That’s good for nobody.
But China needs to get over the repressive reflexes of the one-party state, talk to the Dalai Lama, and understand that harmony in rigidity is impossible.
A multi-ethnic dictatorship is of its essence brittle; it will be more so if it does not bend at its Tibetan edge.
But in defending his own stewardship of the economy over 18 years, a period of generally healthy growth and low inflation, Mr. Greenspan was forced to dredge up some painful memories that have come back to haunt the Fed.

“I don’t know of any time when previous chairmen were so openly discursive about the current arrangements,” said Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon and the leading historian of Fed policy.
Mr. Bernanke, who took over the chairmanship in 2006 promising greater transparency for the central bank, has struggled to maintain the same level of support.

“It’s not popular to dissent.”
The dissenters — Richard W. Fisher of the Dallas Fed and Charles I. Plosser of the Philadelphia branch — said that a rate cut would further fuel inflation, which has grown faster than anticipated on the back of high prices for gasoline and food.
Mr. Plosser argued that the Fed “could not afford to wait until there was clear evidence that inflation expectations were no longer anchored, as by then it would be too late to prevent a further increase in inflation pressures.”

The dissenters also argued that the Fed’s other efforts to restore confidence among lenders — including its decision to provide cheap loans to investment banks in exchange for relatively risky collateral — were a more effective and time-sensitive approach to improving the economy.
“Two voting members who explicitly see the world differently is a notable development,” said Robert Barbera, chief economist at ITG, an investment and research firm.
“Bernanke is under tremendous pressure from the Congress, from the market, and from the president likely,” he said.
“As Mr. Greenspan has discovered, even after you leave, you run into people who criticize what you did even though they may have applauded it when you did it.”

Economists and former bank officials describe Mr. Shirakawa as a veteran central banker with an academic-level command of monetary theory, and the fluency in English to communicate freely with his counterparts in other nations.
“Mr.
Shirakawa should be able to help restore Japan’s credibility in the world,” said Rei Masunaga, an economist and former director general at the Bank of Japan.
Mr. Shirakawa takes the helm as Japan, the world’s second-largest economy after the United States, appears to be at risk of following the United States into recession.
On Wednesday, the bank issued a report saying the Japanese economy was slowing; a leading business-sentiment indicator hit a four-year low last week.
The Tokyo stock market has also tumbled as international investors have soured on the country, which appears adrift in economic policy.
Mr. Fukuda has not set a clear direction for Japan, which appears to have lost enthusiasm for the market-opening policies of the popular former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi.

They do not expect him to deviate much from the cautious policy stance of his predecessor, Toshihiko Fukui, whose term at the bank ended last month.
With Japan’s benchmark overnight interest rates already near rock-bottom at 0.5 percent, Mr. Shirakawa has little room to cut rates to stimulate growth.
“It is important for each country to take monetary and fiscal policy steps that are most appropriate for its economy,” Mr. Shirakawa told reporters after his approval.
Economists say Japan has so far been relatively unscathed by the slump in the American housing market, and its financial markets have been an oasis of relative calm; Japanese banks appear so far to have had limited exposure to the subprime mortgages and related securities that have caused huge write-downs and losses at banks in Europe and America recently.
Still, economists say that Japan is increasingly likely to suffer secondary fallout from the problems in the United States.
Exporters in particular are feeling the pinch from declining demand for cars and electronics by American consumers.
“Mr.
Shirakawa’s biggest challenge will be preventing the sub-prime crisis from spreading to Japan,” said Atsushi Nakajima, chief economist at Japan’s Mizuho Financial Group.

Simply having a hand at the central bank’s tiller will do much to restore global confidence in Japan and its ability to manage its $5 trillion economy, economists and former bank officials said.
He has advised earlier bank governors on trading operations and policy and has written academic articles on monetary theory, and holds a master’s degree in economics from the University of Chicago.
The opposition Democrats, by contrast, seemed to gain the political high ground by arguing for the bank’s independence.
The elections are poised to abolish the monarchy and turn Maoist guerrillas into elected officials.
Having quit their 10-year war against the state, the former rebels are vying for seats in a 601-member assembly that will rewrite the Constitution and govern the country in the meantime.
Final election results are not expected for what could be several weeks — a period that many fear could breed unrest, as rival parties contest one another’s margins of victory.
Political analysts here have said it is unlikely that any one party will win a landslide.
In the end, who loses will count as much as who wins, and how gamely the leaders of the three main parties, including the Maoists, accept defeat, no matter how large.
“I hope we can live peacefully after this.
I hope we can live without fear.”
In the center of Panauti stood a searing reminder of fear: the shell of a building that housed the local government office and that the Maoists bombed about two years ago, their last major attack before signing a peace deal in November 2006.

Election-day violence was far less intense than widely feared, given the insecurity of the campaign season.
The chief of United Nations Mission in Nepal, Ian Martin, said he was pleasantly surprised to call it “overwhelmingly peaceful.”
“The bigger challenge,” he said, “is the political parties’ respecting the outcome and working together.”

The Election Commission confirmed that two people were killed Thursday.
One was a candidate in the southern plains plagued for several months by violent demands for greater autonomy, according to The Associated Press.
Out of nearly 21,000 voting booths, the Election Commission said, voting had to be suspended in 33, after rival parties sought to seize and destroy voting materials, in one case pouring water on a ballot box and burning it in another.
The number of stations where votes have to be cast again is likely to rise.
The Constituent Assembly, as it is called, will decide everything from whether Nepal remains a Hindu kingdom to what new rights will be extended to its long marginalized communities to the very system of government.

His Carter Center is among several international observer teams deployed across the country.
In a hamlet nestled in the hills of Kavre district, east of the capital, a group of men sat on the grass and recalled how during the war, the Maoists would storm their homes, demanding food and shelter.
“If the new ones get a chance, it might be easier for them to live a normal life,” he said.
The Maoist chairman, known by his nom de guerre, Prachanda, or in Nepali, the Fierce One, has promised to abide by the election verdict.
Even some of the staunchest critics of the former rebels said the elections would force the former rebels to behave, in exchange for any shot at power.
“No, I’m in touch,” Mr. Obama said.
“I know exactly what’s going on.
I know what’s going on in Pennsylvania, I know what’s going on in Indiana, I know what’s going on in Illinois.
People are fed up, they’re angry, they’re frustrated, they’re bitter and they want to see a change in Washington.
That’s why I’m running for president of the United States of America.”

With 10 contests remaining in the Democratic presidential primary, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are engaged in a vigorous dispute over which candidate could be the party’s strongest nominee against Mr. McCain.
The Democrats are embroiled in a vigorous battle for the Pennsylvania primary on April 22.
“Pennsylvanians don’t need a president who looks down on them; they need a president who stands up for them, who fights for them, who works hard for your futures, your jobs, your families.”
After her remarks, aides to Mrs. Clinton issued several statements criticizing Mr. Obama, including ones that contained criticism from Republicans.
“It shows an elitism and condescension toward hard-working Americans that is nothing short of breathtaking,” said Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain.
“It is hard to imagine someone running for president who is more out of touch with average Americans.”

He responded with unusual force at a town meeting at a high school in Terre Haute, Ind., seeking to explain his statement that voters are bitter.
“Here’s what’s rich,” Mr. Obama said.
“Senator Clinton said, ‘Well I don’t think people are bitter in Pennsylvania.
I think Barack is being condescending.’ John McCain said, ‘How could he say that?
How could he say that people are bitter?
He obviously is out of touch with people.’ Out of touch?
Out of touch?
Late Friday evening, the Clinton and McCain campaigns criticized Mr. Obama once again for failing to express regret for his remark.
He added, “Americans are tired of a President who looks down on them, they want a President who will stand up for them for a change.”
Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Mr. McCain, issued a similar response.
“Instead of apologizing to small town Americans for dismissing their values, Barack Obama arrogantly tried to spin his way out of his outrageous San Francisco remarks,” Mr. Bounds said, adding: “You can’t be more out of touch than that.”
While the lack of people is good for misanthropes like myself, it’s obviously tough on innkeepers.
Thanks to Paul Gauguin’s tempestuous relationship with the island, Hiva Oa may be the best known of the Marquesas.
Or maybe now it is Nuka Hiva, thanks to having been host of the fourth season of “Survivor.” It is the biggest of the islands, formed by two volcanoes resting on top of each another, and in 1842 was the first island to be spied from a whaler by Herman Melville, who wrote it was “a country that no description could fit the beauty.”

Several jagged volcanic peaks mark the diamond-shaped Ua Pou, its tiny offshore islets home to millions of seabirds.
It is also home to the chain’s most active artist colony, mostly wood carvers and bone necklace makers.
Ua Huku is crescent-shaped, home to more goats and wild horses than people (just 575).
Fatu Hiva is the southernmost in the chain.
Hiva Oa was once home to 130,000; today fewer than 1,900 people are scattered through the deep valleys and in a half-dozen small villages scattered around its perimeter.
Houses are of painted wood and the landscape is as primitive as it was 1,200 years ago.
A long, crescent-shaped beach fronts the biggest town of Atuona, which hasn’t changed much since Gauguin built his House of Pleasure in its center.
On a hot, dry morning I follow the beach past Atuona and walk four miles to Taaoa, where a sizable tohua (temple) has been restored.
Eight-foot-tall marae and tiki made from basalt still hide in the lush forest, mostly hidden.
This day the sounds are of crowing cocks and a road crew’s jackhammer.
Human sacrifice has been replaced by worship in a mix of Roman Catholic, Protestant, Mormon and Jehovah’s Witness churches.

If one single thing is responsible for French Polynesia’s enduring reputation as paradise, it is the paintings of Gauguin, who moved to Hiva Oa in 1901 after wearing out his welcome on several other Polynesian islands.
Filled with grace and mystery, they were mostly of an imagined place, a paradise that did not exist, featuring languorous women smiling into the distance, horses grazing in vanilla groves and baskets overflowing with breadfruit and bananas.
A short walk from either the beach or the stone temple into the heart of Atuona delivers me to the doorstep of one of history’s most infamous paradise seekers.
The two-story, A-frame house is constructed from woven bamboo.
Carved around its wooden door frame are erotic figures and the words “Be Mysterious” and “Be in Love.” The name of the house is carved above its entrance: Maison de Jouir.
House of Pleasure, Sexual Pleasure.
A large window looks out over an open well; Gauguin kept a bamboo rod with a fishing line nearby, to raise and lower cups of cold water from the well to add to his absinthe.
Gone are the pornographic photos he kept on the walls, and his collection of walking sticks with carved phallic heads.
Gauguin is buried on a hillside above the house, in a small field that looks over the ocean.
It is a scene depicted in some of his last paintings.
To his headstone is chained a copy of one of his carved statues, called Oviri, or Savage.
He died in his House of Pleasure with a bad heart, failing eyes, morphine-addicted, leprous and syphilitic and soon to become one of the world’s greatest and best-known artists.

Two days later, thanks to the modern convenience of small aircraft, I found myself hiking remote trails on Nuka Hiva.
Each morning I set out from the center of the main town of Taiohae, having asked directions from various locals the night before.
It takes about four hours.

Outfitters and the government on Nuka Hiva have committed to cutting a trail system across the island in recent years, in part due to the economic kick in the pants the “Survivor” show brought to the island.
The trails exist thanks to decades of wild pig, horse and hunter’s traffic; the idea — fomented by a local tour company called Marquises Rando — is to expand them into more accessible walkways without using much modern technology.
Why introduce cement and steel when acacia or coconut tree trunks tied together work just as well as bridges, and volcanic rocks are perfect for bordering footpaths?
The idea is to open up the mountains to visitors, creating options from six-hour round-trip walks to two-day treks with camps in between.
The diversity of walks is incredible.
One morning I hire a small boat to carry me to a trailhead that leads to the Ahuii waterfall, which plunges 1,100 feet from high in the dense jungle.
It’s a two-hour walk that involves a couple of thigh-high river crossings and ends with a swim in the eel-laden pool beneath the falls, and passes a handful of crumbling, thousand-year-old stone platforms along the way.
On the opposite side of the island, just up from the beach is the Hikokua tohua where a dozen tikis watch over a grass-covered field once used for games and human sacrifices.
Near the beach the biggest modern-day landmark is a sizable beige church and a restaurant big enough to feed the one hundred-plus passengers who arrive by cruise boat every few weeks for a lobster feast.
My last hike on Nuka Hiva is up and over a steep, 600-foot-tall pass from the village of Taipivai to a sand beach at Anaho, past stands of wild vanilla and fields of wild horses.
The white beach is studded with smooth black boulders, a rare reef slowing the crashing of waves making it perfect for a swim.
A solitary man lives in a fishing shack and waves me over to sample some dried fish and coconut milk.
As we talk, hiding from the midday sun, I ask for his definition of paradise.
Without pause he says simply: “Wherever I am.
And on most days, I am right here!”

GETTING THERE
The most direct way from New York to the Marquesas is to fly nonstop to Papeete, Tahiti, on Air Tahiti Nui (June to October only; flights in other months have a layover in Los Angeles), about $1,700 (www.airtahitinui-usa.com; 877-824-4846).
Air Tahiti Nui also has more frequent flights from Los Angeles.
From Papeete to the outer islands of the Marquesas, Air Tahiti flies several times a week to both Hiva Oa and Nuku Hiva, round trip about 63,000 French Polynesian francs, or about $795 at 79.2 francs to the dollar (www.airtahiti.pf; 689-86-42-42).
An alternative is to see the Marquesas by cruise ship.
Regent Seven Seas Cruises sails the Paul Gauguin out of Tahiti and visits the outer islands of French Polynesia several times during the year (www.rssc.com).
WHERE TO STAY
There are a few options on either Nuku Hiva or Hiva Oa, starting with home stays, simple rooms with board in family homes.
These are difficult to arrange in advance but easy to find once you have arrived at airport or dock.
Each island has a Pearl Resort Lodge.
The Nuku Hiva Keikahanui Pearl Lodge has 20 bungalows (premium and deluxe) and sits at the end of the main road in Taiohae (rates begin at 25,000 French Polynesian francs plus tax; 689-50-84-52 www.pearlresorts.com/keikahanui).
The same is true on Hiva Oa.
Several families rent out rooms in the main town of Hanakee; from the infinity pool at the Hiva Oa Hanakee Pearl Lodge you have a 200-degree view of 3,900-foot Mount Temetiu.
There are 14 bungalows with similar views (www.pearlresorts.com/hiva; the rates and phone number are the same as those for Nuku Hiva).

MUST SEE
On Nuku Hiva, the hotel can arrange horseback rides and motorboat transfer to various trails dead-ending in spectacular waterfalls.
The sandy beach at Anaho requires a short (40-minute) hike, but is worth it.
Nearby are the sacrifice and worship sites at Hikokua and Kamuihai.
On Hiva Oa, it’s obligatory to visit the Paul Gauguin Museum and the painter’s grave; the French singer Jacques Brel is buried in the same cemetery.
An hour’s drive to Puamau winds through jungle hills and by seaside overlooks.
LEGAL aid lawyers are among the few allies of poor homeowners caught in the subprime-mortgage meltdown.
But these lawyers are hamstrung by federal regulations that limit homeowners’ access to speedy, low-cost legal relief.
One restriction prohibits legal aid lawyers, unlike their corporate counterparts, from collecting attorney fees on behalf of vindicated clients.
Fee awards are an incentive for both parties to negotiate quickly because legal costs increase as litigation drags on.
Recalcitrant lenders can stall as long as they like, knowing it will cost them nothing.
This is especially harmful because legal aid societies have been swamped by the foreclosure crisis, and lawyers tied up in litigation are unavailable to other at-risk homeowners.
Another counterproductive regulation prevents legal aid lawyers from lobbying lawmakers with solutions to repair our mortgage markets.
Policy deliberation is an echo chamber, dominated by financial players, excluding legal aid experts, who criticized short-sighted deregulation.
Finally, federal law forbids legal aid lawyers to undertake class action litigation, preventing them from attacking systemic abuses in the real estate industry.
Class actions offer the best chance for taking on foreclosure fraud, identifying illegal fees, recovering stolen equity and sending powerful signals to would-be predators.
Instead, legal aid lawyers must prosecute cases one at a time.
Subprime lenders aggressively went after the financially unsophisticated like the elderly, their fixed incomes strained by the increasing cost of living, and those in low-income and minority neighborhoods.

If the federal government had not weakened and silenced legal aid, borrowers would have been far better protected against the abuses of our unregulated subprime mortgage industry.
Now that many of these families risk losing their homes, we should get rid of misguided regulations on the lawyers who can best help them.
The higher prices put pressure on businesses to pass on costs to consumers, though some economists said the housing slump and weakening job market could discourage businesses from raising their prices.
“Given the weak nature of domestic demand now and going forward, it is unlikely that businesses will have as much success raising prices at the consumer level as they did in the not too distant past,” Joshua Shapiro, an economist at the research firm MFR, wrote in a note to clients.

The increases did not spread to popular products like automobiles and clothing.
The closely watched core measure of the Producer Price Index, which excludes volatile costs of food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in March, falling back from an unexpected 0.5 percent rise in February.
The low core rate could take some pressure off the Fed as it tries to balance rising inflation with the overall slowdown in growth.
Fed officials have acknowledged that inflation remains a serious concern, but they have signaled they will continue to focus on staving off a prolonged recession.

Central bankers meet for a two-day session starting on April 29, when they are expected to lower the Fed’s benchmark interest rate, a move that can stimulate growth but can also cause prices to rise.
Still, it will be difficult for the Fed to ignore the large cost increases in energy and food.
Food costs rose 1.2 percent after declining 0.5 percent the month before.
Prices are rising further up the production pipeline, as well.
These numbers tend to be highly volatile, but they signal that businesses will continue to face higher prices in the months ahead.
If the capital-raising frenzy is ending, it is clear that those Wall Street firms that acted most rapidly to raise capital were able to get money on the best terms.
To be sure, it will pay 11 percent interest for a while, a phenomenally high rate even if it is structured to be tax-deductible.
But Abu Dhabi will eventually get common stock at a price of $31.89 or higher — a price more than 30 percent above the current quote.
In general, it appears that the sovereign wealth funds that moved in quickly could have gotten better deals by waiting.
Longstanding shareholders in Wall Street firms are suffering, albeit not as much as those in Bear.
Dilution has been inevitable, and painful.
Still, some banks have handled it better than others.
Last week Washington Mutual raised $7 billion in capital by selling stock at prices well below market to a private equity fund.
Some of the company’s existing shareholders might have lusted after the same deal, but it was not offered to them.
“I understand it hurts,” he said.
“I want people to calm down, have a little faith.”

By contrast, Wachovia this week raised $7 billion in a public offering that gave existing shareholders a chance to get in on the deal.
One question now is whether the banks have finally cleaned up their balance sheets and marked down dubious securities and mortgages to the point that fewer write-offs will be needed, and whether the banks have adequate capital to ride out the storms that are remaining.

Even if the capital is not adequate, however, investors are starting to assume that the government stands behind Wall Street.
It appears that the real way we are going to get out of this crisis is to have the government guarantee lots of things.
“The universal cry of the bust is, ‘Give me a government guarantee,’ ” said Alex J. Pollack, a former president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago who is now a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, speaking at a conference at the Levy Institute of Bard College here in Annandale-on-Hudson on Thursday.
As private balance sheets are cut back to reduce leverage, he forecast, the government’s balance sheet will grow rapidly.
All those government guarantees may reduce the risk of failure, but there are still perils for investors in bank stocks.
With credit hard to come by, the real economy may be in for rough times, creating more loan losses.
Wall Street may not need to beg for any more capital, but it is a good bet that its layoffs are only starting.
There is not much need for the people who put together securitizations when there is virtually no market for such deals.
If that market does not revive, profits may be disappointing even if the flows of red ink are finally nearing an end.
AMERICANS are cutting back on purchases of things they do not have to have, sending retail sales down sharply at many types of stores.
Those cutbacks, which now seem to be worse than at any time since the 1990-91 recession, are helping to slow the economy and to spur calls in Washington for more fiscal stimulus even before the government starts to send out money to most taxpayers next month.
Those checks could provide at least a temporary stimulus, but until they arrive, the slowdown in spending appears to be nationwide.
With the dollar down sharply against the euro and the British pound, there are more foreign visitors and many of them find prices low compared with what they are used to back home.

But spending more money on food and gasoline leaves less for other things, and sales were down, even without adjusting for inflation, at department stores, clothing stores and furniture stores, as well as at auto dealers.
The accompanying chart adjusts sales for inflation, and looks only at the trends in retail sales other than at gasoline stations.
The inflation adjustment is for all commodities — that is, for the entire Consumer Price Index except for services.
It may have been better to adjust using an index for commodities other than energy, but the government does not publish that.
The latest figure shows that such sales fell 4.5 percent during the first three months of this year, compared with the same period of last year.
That is the deepest decline since the 1990-91 recession.
For shopkeepers, there is less business to go around these days.
The effort, which began with the buildup to the Iraq war and continues to this day, has sought to exploit ideological and military allegiances, and also a powerful financial dynamic: Most of the analysts have ties to military contractors vested in the very war policies they are asked to assess on air.

Those business relationships are hardly ever disclosed to the viewers, and sometimes not even to the networks themselves.
But collectively, the men on the plane and several dozen other military analysts represent more than 150 military contractors either as lobbyists, senior executives, board members or consultants.
The companies include defense heavyweights, but also scores of smaller companies, all part of a vast assemblage of contractors scrambling for hundreds of billions in military business generated by the administration’s war on terror.
It is a furious competition, one in which inside information and easy access to senior officials are highly prized.
Records and interviews show how the Bush administration has used its control over access and information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse — an instrument intended to shape terrorism coverage from inside the major TV and radio networks.
Analysts have been wooed in hundreds of private briefings with senior military leaders, including officials with significant influence over contracting and budget matters, records show.
They have been taken on tours of Iraq and given access to classified intelligence.
They have been briefed by officials from the White House, State Department and Justice Department, including Mr. Cheney, Alberto R. Gonzales and Stephen J. Hadley.
In turn, members of this group have echoed administration talking points, sometimes even when they suspected the information was false or inflated.
Some analysts acknowledge they suppressed doubts because they feared jeopardizing their access.
A few expressed regret for participating in what they regarded as an effort to dupe the American public with propaganda dressed as independent military analysis.
“It was them saying, ‘We need to stick our hands up your back and move your mouth for you,’ ” Robert S. Bevelacqua, a retired Green Beret and former Fox News analyst, said.

“Night and day,” Mr. Allard said, “I felt we’d been hosed.”
The Pentagon defended its relationship with military analysts, saying they had been given only factual information about the war.
“The intent and purpose of this is nothing other than an earnest attempt to inform the American people,” Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said.
“I’m not here representing the administration,” Dr. McCausland said.
Some network officials, meanwhile, acknowledged only a limited understanding of their analysts’ interactions with the administration.
The onus is on their analysts to disclose conflicts, they said.
And whatever the contributions of military analysts, they also noted the many network journalists who have covered the war for years in all its complexity.
Five years into the Iraq war, most details of the architecture and execution of the Pentagon’s campaign have never been disclosed.
But The Times successfully sued the Defense Department to gain access to 8,000 pages of e-mail messages, transcripts and records describing years of private briefings, trips to Iraq and Guantánamo and an extensive Pentagon talking points operation.
These records reveal a symbiotic relationship where the usual dividing lines between government and journalism have been obliterated.
Internal Pentagon documents repeatedly refer to the military analysts as “message force multipliers” or “surrogates” who could be counted on to deliver administration “themes and messages” to millions of Americans “in the form of their own opinions.”
Though many analysts are paid network consultants, making $500 to $1,000 per appearance, in Pentagon meetings they sometimes spoke as if they were operating behind enemy lines, interviews and transcripts show.
Many — although certainly not all — faithfully echoed talking points intended to counter critics.

“Good work,” Thomas G. McInerney, a retired Air Force general, consultant and Fox News analyst, wrote to the Pentagon after receiving fresh talking points in late 2006.
“We will use it.”
Again and again, records show, the administration has enlisted analysts as a rapid reaction force to rebut what it viewed as critical news coverage, some of it by the networks’ own Pentagon correspondents.
For example, when news articles revealed that troops in Iraq were dying because of inadequate body armor, a senior Pentagon official wrote to his colleagues: “I think our analysts — properly armed — can push back in that arena.”
The documents released by the Pentagon do not show any quid pro quo between commentary and contracts.
John C. Garrett is a retired Marine colonel and unpaid analyst for Fox News TV and radio.
He is also a lobbyist at Patton Boggs who helps firms win Pentagon contracts, including in Iraq.
In promotional materials, he states that as a military analyst he “is privy to weekly access and briefings with the secretary of defense, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other high level policy makers in the administration.” One client told investors that Mr. Garrett’s special access and decades of experience helped him “to know in advance — and in detail — how best to meet the needs” of the Defense Department and other agencies.
He also acknowledged using this access and information to identify opportunities for clients.
“You can’t help but look for that,” he said, adding, “If you know a capability that would fill a niche or need, you try to fill it.
“That’s good for everybody.”
At the same time, in e-mail messages to the Pentagon, Mr. Garrett displayed an eagerness to be supportive with his television and radio commentary.
“Please let me know if you have any specific points you want covered or that you would prefer to downplay,” he wrote in January 2007, before President Bush went on TV to describe the surge strategy in Iraq.
Conversely, the administration has demonstrated that there is a price for sustained criticism, many analysts said.
“You’ll lose all access,” Dr. McCausland said.
With a majority of Americans calling the war a mistake despite all administration attempts to sway public opinion, the Pentagon has focused in the last couple of years on cultivating in particular military analysts frequently seen and heard in conservative news outlets, records and interviews show.
On the flight to Cuba, for much of the day at Guantánamo and on the flight home that night, Pentagon officials briefed the 10 or so analysts on their key messages — how much had been spent improving the facility, the abuse endured by guards, the extensive rights afforded detainees.
The analysts went on TV and radio, decrying Amnesty International, criticizing calls to close the facility and asserting that all detainees were treated humanely.
“The impressions that you’re getting from the media and from the various pronouncements being made by people who have not been here in my opinion are totally false,” Donald W. Shepperd, a retired Air Force general, reported live on CNN by phone from Guantánamo that same afternoon.
“The place is very professionally run.”
Within days, transcripts of the analysts’ appearances were circulated to senior White House and Pentagon officials, cited as evidence of progress in the battle for hearts and minds at home.
Pentagon and White House officials believed the military analysts could play a crucial role in helping overcome this resistance.
And so even before Sept. 11, she built a system within the Pentagon to recruit “key influentials” — movers and shakers from all walks who with the proper ministrations might be counted on to generate support for Mr. Rumsfeld’s priorities.
They were framing how viewers ought to interpret events.
“It is very hard for me to criticize the United States Army,” said William L. Nash, a retired Army general and ABC analyst.
“It is my life.”
Other administrations had made sporadic, small-scale attempts to build relationships with the occasional military analyst.
“We didn’t want to rely on them to be our primary vehicle to get information out,” Mr. Meyer said.
The Pentagon’s regular press office would be kept separate from the military analysts.
The analysts would instead be catered to by a small group of political appointees, with the point person being Brent T. Krueger, another senior aide to Ms. Clarke.
Federal agencies, for example, have paid columnists to write favorably about the administration.
They have distributed to local TV stations hundreds of fake news segments with fawning accounts of administration accomplishments.
The Pentagon itself has made covert payments to Iraqi newspapers to publish coalition propaganda.
This time, Mr. Krueger said, the military analysts would in effect be “writing the op-ed” for the war.
Assembling the Team
From the start, interviews show, the White House took a keen interest in which analysts had been identified by the Pentagon, requesting lists of potential recruits, and suggesting names.
At least nine of them have written op-ed articles for The Times.
The group was heavily represented by men involved in the business of helping companies win military contracts.
James Marks, a retired Army general and analyst for CNN from 2004 to 2007, pursued military and intelligence contracts as a senior executive with McNeil Technologies.
General McInerney, the Fox analyst, for example, sits on the boards of several military contractors, including Nortel Government Solutions, a supplier of communication networks.
Several were defense industry lobbyists, such as Dr. McCausland, who works at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, a major lobbying firm where he is director of a national security team that represents several military contractors.
“We offer clients access to key decision makers,” Dr. McCausland’s team promised on the firm’s Web site.
Dr. McCausland was not the only analyst making this pledge.
Soon after signing on with CBS, General Ralston was named vice chairman of the Cohen Group, a consulting firm headed by a former defense secretary, William Cohen, himself now a “world affairs” analyst for CNN.
“The Cohen Group knows that getting to ‘yes’ in the aerospace and defense market — whether in the United States or abroad — requires that companies have a thorough, up-to-date understanding of the thinking of government decision makers,” the company tells prospective clients on its Web site.
Two of NBC’s most prominent analysts, Barry R. McCaffrey and the late Wayne A.
Downing, were on the advisory board of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, an advocacy group created with White House encouragement in 2002 to help make the case for ousting Saddam Hussein.
He urged a radically new approach to psychological operations in future wars — taking aim at not just foreign adversaries but domestic audiences, too.
“Oh, you have no idea,” Mr. Allard said, describing the effect.
“You’re back.
They listen to you.
“It’s not like it’s, ‘We’ll pay you $500 to get our story out,’ ” he said.
In the fall and winter leading up to the invasion, the Pentagon armed its analysts with talking points portraying Iraq as an urgent threat.
“You could see they were taking verbatim what the secretary was saying or what the technical specialists were saying.
You’d look at them and say, ‘This is working.’ ”
On April 12, 2003, with major combat almost over, Mr. Rumsfeld drafted a memorandum to Ms. Clarke.
“Let’s think about having some of the folks who did such a good job as talking heads in after this thing is over,” he wrote.

By summer, though, the first signs of the insurgency had emerged.
L. Paul Bremer III, then the American viceroy in Iraq, wrote in his memoir, “My Year in Iraq,” that he had privately warned the White House that the United States had “about half the number of soldiers we needed here.”
“We’re up against a growing and sophisticated threat,” Mr. Bremer recalled telling the president during a private White House dinner.
Yet these harsh realities were elided, or flatly contradicted, during the official presentations for the analysts, records show.
The itinerary, scripted to the minute, featured brief visits to a model school, a few refurbished government buildings, a center for women’s rights, a mass grave and even the gardens of Babylon.
These sessions, records show, spooled out an alternative narrative, depicting an Iraq bursting with political and economic energy, its security forces blossoming.

“We’re winning,” a briefing document proclaimed.
It also was a chance to gather inside information about the most pressing needs confronting the American mission: the acute shortages of “up-armored” Humvees; the billions to be spent building military bases; the urgent need for interpreters; and the ambitious plans to train Iraq’s security forces.
At the time, the company was seeking contracts worth tens of millions to supply body armor and counterintelligence services in Iraq.
One briefer, for example, mentioned that the Army was resorting to packing inadequately armored Humvees with sandbags and Kevlar blankets.
Descriptions of the Iraqi security forces were withering.
“They can’t shoot, but then again, they don’t,” one officer told them, according to one participant’s notes.

The Pentagon, though, need not have worried.
“You can’t believe the progress,” General Vallely told Alan Colmes of Fox News upon his return.
He predicted the insurgency would be “down to a few numbers” within months.

“We could not be more excited, more pleased,” Mr. Cowan told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News.
And on the key strategic question of the moment — whether to send more troops — the analysts were unanimous.
“I am so much against adding more troops,” General Shepperd said on CNN.
“We’re hitting a home run on this trip,” a senior Pentagon official wrote in an e-mail message to Richard B. Myers and Peter Pace, then chairman and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The pace of briefings accelerated.
Eventually the effort involved officials from Washington to Baghdad to Kabul to Guantánamo and back to Tampa, Fla., the headquarters of United States Central Command.
When officials in Iraq were slow to organize another trip for analysts, a Pentagon official fired off an e-mail message warning that the trips “have the highest levels of visibility” at the White House and urging them to get moving before Lawrence Di Rita, one of Mr. Rumsfeld’s closest aides, “picks up the phone and starts calling the 4-stars.”
Mr. Di Rita, no longer at the Defense Department, said in an interview that a “conscious decision” was made to rely on the military analysts to counteract “the increasingly negative view of the war” coming from journalists in Iraq.
Charles T. Nash, a Fox military analyst and retired Navy captain, is a consultant who helps small companies break into the military market.
“You start to recognize what’s most important to them,” he said, adding, “There’s nothing like seeing stuff firsthand.”

Some Pentagon officials said they were well aware that some analysts viewed their special access as a business advantage.
“We weren’t naïve about that.”
They also understood the financial relationship between the networks and their analysts.
Many analysts were being paid by the “hit,” the number of times they appeared on TV.
The more an analyst could boast of fresh inside information from high-level Pentagon “sources,” the more hits he could expect.
“They have taken lobbying and the search for contracts to a far higher level,” Mr. Krueger said.
“That’s not something that ever crossed my mind,” he said.
“We assume they know where the lines are,” he said.
They had dozens more sessions with the most senior members of his brain trust and access to officials responsible for managing the billions being spent in Iraq.
Other groups of “key influentials” had meetings, but not nearly as often as the analysts.
The memorandum, written by a Pentagon official who had accompanied analysts to Iraq, said that based on her observations during the trip, the analysts “are having a greater impact” on network coverage of the military.
“They have now become the go-to guys not only on breaking stories, but they influence the views on issues,” she wrote.
“I know a snow job when I see one,” he said.
He recalled asking the briefer whether the United States had “smoking gun” proof.
“ ‘We don’t have any hard evidence,’ ” Mr. Bevelacqua recalled the briefer replying.
“We are looking at ourselves saying, ‘What are we doing?’ ”
Another analyst, Robert L. Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who works in the Pentagon for a military contractor, attended the same briefing and recalled feeling “very disappointed” after being shown satellite photographs purporting to show bunkers associated with a hidden weapons program.
“You’re talking about fighting a huge machine.”
Some e-mail messages between the Pentagon and the analysts reveal an implicit trade of privileged access for favorable coverage.
Robert H. Scales Jr., a retired Army general and analyst for Fox News and National Public Radio whose consulting company advises several military firms on weapons and tactics used in Iraq, wanted the Pentagon to approve high-level briefings for him inside Iraq in 2006.
“I will do the same this time.”
Pentagon Keeps Tabs
As it happened, the analysts’ news media appearances were being closely monitored.
Omnitec evaluated their appearances using the same tools as corporate branding experts.
One report, assessing the impact of several trips to Iraq in 2005, offered example after example of analysts echoing Pentagon themes on all the networks.
“None of us drink the Kool-Aid,” General Scales said.
Likewise, several also denied using their special access for business gain.
Several analysts told of fielding telephone calls from displeased defense officials only minutes after being on the air.
On Aug. 3, 2005, 14 marines died in Iraq.
The Pentagon, he wrote in an e-mail message, “simply didn’t like the fact that I wasn’t carrying their water.” The next day James T. Conway, then director of operations for the Joint Chiefs, presided over another conference call with analysts.

“The strategic target remains our population,” General Conway said.
“We can lose people day in and day out, but they’re never going to beat our military.
What they can and will do if they can is strip away our support.
“Let’s work it together, guys,” General Conway urged.
The Generals’ Revolt
The full dimensions of this mutual embrace were perhaps never clearer than in April 2006, after several of Mr. Rumsfeld’s former generals — none of them network military analysts — went public with devastating critiques of his wartime performance.
On Friday, April 14, with what came to be called the “Generals’ Revolt” dominating headlines, Mr. Rumsfeld instructed aides to summon military analysts to a meeting with him early the next week, records show.
When an aide urged a short delay to “give our big guys on the West Coast a little more time to buy a ticket and get here,” Mr. Rumsfeld’s office insisted that “the boss” wanted the meeting fast “for impact on the current story.”

That same day, Pentagon officials helped two Fox analysts, General McInerney and General Vallely, write an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal defending Mr. Rumsfeld.
“Starting to write it now,” General Vallely wrote to the Pentagon that afternoon.
“Vallely is going to use the numbers,” a Pentagon official reported that afternoon.
The standard secrecy notwithstanding, plans for this session leaked, producing a front-page story in The Times that Sunday.

A transcript of that session, never before disclosed, shows a shared determination to marginalize war critics and revive public support for the war.
“I’m an old intel guy,” said one analyst.
(The transcript omits speakers’ names.)
“And I can sum all of this up, unfortunately, with one word.
That is Psyops.
Now most people may hear that and they think, ‘Oh my God, they’re trying to brainwash.’ ”
“What are you, some kind of a nut?” Mr. Rumsfeld cut in, drawing laughter.
“You don’t believe in the Constitution?”
There was little discussion about the actual criticism pouring forth from Mr. Rumsfeld’s former generals.
And whether we have democracy in Iraq or not, it doesn’t mean a tinker’s damn if we end up with the result we want, which is a regime over there that’s not a threat to us.”
“Yeah,” Mr. Rumsfeld said, taking notes.
“America hates a loser,” one analyst said.
“You are the leader,” the analyst told Mr. Rumsfeld.
“You are our guy.”
At another point, an analyst made a suggestion: “In one of your speeches you ought to say, ‘Everybody stop for a minute and imagine an Iraq ruled by Zarqawi.’ And then you just go down the list and say, ‘All right, we’ve got oil, money, sovereignty, access to the geographic center of gravity of the Middle East, blah, blah, blah.’ If you can just paint a mental picture for Joe America to say, ‘Oh my God, I can’t imagine a world like that.’ ”
Even as they assured Mr. Rumsfeld that they stood ready to help in this public relations offensive, the analysts sought guidance on what they should cite as the next “milestone” that would, as one analyst put it, “keep the American people focused on the idea that we’re moving forward to a positive end.” They placed particular emphasis on the growing confrontation with Iran.
“And again, I’m not trying to tell you how to do your job...”
“Get in line,” Mr. Rumsfeld interjected.
Days later, Mr. Rumsfeld wrote a memorandum distilling their collective guidance into bullet points.
Iran is the concern.
View From the Networks
Two weeks ago General Petraeus took time out from testifying before Congress about Iraq for a conference call with military analysts.
Mr. Garrett, the Fox analyst and Patton Boggs lobbyist, said he told General Petraeus during the call to “keep up the great work.”
“Hey,” Mr. Garrett said in an interview, “anything we can do to help.”
For the moment, though, because of heavy election coverage and general war fatigue, military analysts are not getting nearly as much TV time, and the networks have trimmed their rosters of analysts.
Still, almost weekly the Pentagon continues to conduct briefings with selected military analysts.
The networks, they said, have little grasp of how often they meet with senior officials, or what is discussed.
“I don’t think NBC was even aware we were participating,” said Rick Francona, a longtime military analyst for the network.
Some networks publish biographies on their Web sites that describe their analysts’ military backgrounds and, in some cases, give at least limited information about their business ties.
NBC News also declined to discuss its procedures for hiring and monitoring military analysts.
“We make it clear to them we expect them to keep us closely apprised,” he said.
CNN requires its military analysts to disclose in writing all outside sources of income.
But like the other networks, it does not provide its military analysts with the kind of written, specific ethical guidelines it gives its full-time employees for avoiding real or apparent conflicts of interest.
Yet even where controls exist, they have sometimes proven porous.
“I mean, that’s what McNeil does,” he said.
If he was bidding on Pentagon contracts, CNN said, that should have disqualified him from being a military analyst for the network.
“I’ve got zero challenge separating myself from a business interest,” he said.
PARIS — The Bank of England said Monday that it would allow banks to swap mortgage-backed securities valued at about $100 billion for government bonds in an effort to restore calm to the British financial markets.
"The Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme is designed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and raise confidence in financial markets while ensuring that the risk of losses on the loans they have made remains with the banks," Mervyn King, the central bank governor, said in the statement.
The central bank said that banks would be able to temporarily swap illiquid assets of "sufficiently high quality" for Treasury bills, but that responsibility for losses on the loans would stay with the banks.
"Discussions with banks suggest that use of the scheme is initially likely to be around £50 billion," or $100 billion, the central bank said.

"We haven't seen this in generations," he said on BBC television.
"It's happening in America, Europe, the Far East.
It is affecting countries all over the world.
We're determined to do everything we can to get normality here."
The central bank said the asset swaps would be for a period of one year and could be renewed for a total of up to three years, and that banks would remain responsible for the risk of losses on their loans.
The swaps are available only for assets existing at the end of 2007 and cannot be used to finance new lending, it said.
Because the government bonds are almost risk-free, they are easy to trade, and banks will presumably be more willing to lend to one another.
The central bank will hold the illiquid mortgage assets as collateral.

"The Fed has been doing something similar for a while in the United States," he said, "and that hasn't solved all the problems there."
The United States Federal Reserve said last month that it would undertake swaps of up to $200 billion of American government bonds for mortgage-backed securities.
"This is not going to take the place of what we believe will be further necessary and quite significant cuts in interest rates," Mr. Loynes said.
Mr.
Darling was preparing to for a session later Monday of the House of Commons where he was to further explain the plan.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government, facing difficult local elections in May, has been under pressure to shore up the financial system and restart the mortgage market as British home price increases stall.
Despite three interest rate cuts that have taken the Bank of England's benchmark rate to 5 percent, the three-month London interbank sterling rate, a reference rate for loans between banks, was at nearly 5.9 percent Friday, a spread that indicates that banks remain nervous about their peers.
Mr. Loynes said that a year from now the Bank of England's main interest rate could be as low as 3.5 percent, while the fed funds rate might be as low as 1 percent.
Global banks have had losses and write-downs totaling $200 billion since the collapse last summer of the market in securities based on subprime United States mortgages.
The International Monetary Fund has estimated that the total cost of the credit crisis could reach $1 trillion.
A primary objective of the bank is to maintain price stability, and it seeks to hold the rate of inflation below 2 percent over the medium term.
In March, the rate was at 3.6 percent, according to Eurostat.
The price of oil is up 24 percent this year.

In a clear sign that the euro’s sharp rise against the dollar is weighing ever more heavily on some exporters, Airbus said Tuesday that it would raise the price of its aircraft, which are priced in dollars.
Not only is its main product priced in dollars, but the company is constrained politically from moving big chunks of production out of Europe to dollar-based countries to ease the currency pressure.
Airbus has joint management in France and Germany and thousands of jobs in both countries.
Airbus said its price increases — up to $4 million on the flagship A380 superjumbo jet — would go into effect May 1.
It blamed the falling value of the dollar and the rising prices of commodities like steel and aluminum used in making aircraft.
“We have to keep pace with the world market price developments and secure profitable deals,” said John Leahy, a chief operating officer.

Its parent company, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, or EADS, has been struggling to reduce the effect of unfavorable exchange rates.
It has also been trying to diversify its exposure and reposition its business to shift more costs into dollars.
The dollar has lost about 15 percent of its value against the euro in the last 12 months while metals prices have gone up at least 6.5 percent, Airbus said in a statement.
The company uses metals for about 40 percent of the construction of new planes, including titanium, steel, aluminum and aluminum-lithium.
Airbus said the price increases would come on top of a normal increase in prices of 2.74 percent and would mean that customers would pay an additional $2 million for a single-aisle aircraft and $4 million for wide-body long-range planes, including the A380.
Mr. Leahy said that even with the price increases, the company’s line of efficient planes would deliver value for airlines in an environment where the price of fuel — currently about 40 percent of an airline’s operating costs — has risen sharply.
Concerns in the business world about the strong euro now threaten a rift of sorts in Europe.
The biggest economy in the 15-nation euro area, Germany, rejected fresh calls to dilute the inflation-fighting mandate of the European Central Bank to help rein in the soaring currency.
The Dow rose 42.99, or 0.34 percent, to 12,763.22, after spiking 117 points, giving up those gains to trade down 17 points, and then recovering some ground.

Wall Street has been digesting a flood of corporate numbers in recent weeks as it tries to ascertain how long the economic slowdown might last.
With little in the way of economic news expected this week, investors are left to concentrate on corporate news and await the next interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, which is due in a week.
Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.74 percent, from 3.69 percent.
Following are the results of Wednesday’s Treasury auction of two-year notes:
Wall Street ended its second consecutive winning week with a moderate advance Friday, overcoming concerns about consumer confidence and inflation.
After slumping early in the session in response to weak consumer confidence and a rise in oil prices, investors seemed to turn their attention to broader signs, including the week’s generally satisfactory earnings reports, that suggested that government efforts to steady the economy were working.
That shift in focus sent stocks up late in the day.
Although the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in with its lowest reading since the early 1980s, Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments in Newport Beach, Calif., said companies’ first-quarter reports convinced investors that “over all, things aren’t all that bad.”
“I think a lot of people went into the weekend feeling they didn’t want to be on the short side,” Mr. Lydon said.
While consumer spending represents about 70 percent of the economy, a UBS equities strategist, David Bianco, said, “It’s the wrong thing to be looking at to gauge the prospects” for companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.

“Business activity is strong in the U.S. and especially globally,” he said.
“That’s far more important.”
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 42.91, or 0.33 percent, to 12,891.86, after falling more than 100 points earlier in the session.
The Nasdaq composite index, depressed by disappointment with a Microsoft forecast, fell 5.99, or 0.25 percent, to 2,422.93, after dropping as much as 1.6 percent during the session.
Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.87 percent, from 3.82 percent.

WASHINGTON
Maybe I’ve been reading too many stories about the fad of teenage vampire chick lit, worlds filled with parasitic aliens and demi-human creatures, but there’s something eerie going on in this race.
Hillary grows more and more glowy as Obama grows more and more wan.
Is she draining him of his precious bodily fluids?
Leeching his magic?
Siphoning off his aura?
Now she’s bristling with life force, and he looks like he wants to run away somewhere for three months by himself and smoke.
Hillary is not getting much sleep or exercise, and doesn’t, like the ascetic Obama, abstain from junk food and coffee and get up at dawn to work out on the road.
Yet she’s the one who is more energetic and focused and beaming, and he’s the one who seems uneven and gauzy, often fatigued and unable to disguise being fed up with the slog.
Even his speeches don’t have the same pizazz.

A man at a sports bar in Latrobe, Pa., advised Obama, “Get some sleep, Barack, you look like you’re tired, man.”
When the candidate noted he’s been running for president for 15 months, the guy offered another tip: “You need a drink.”
Obama disdains convention and touts his new politics, but on Friday, he had a news conference in an uninspired setting — a gas station emptied out by his Secret Service detail.
He doesn’t emulate Bobby Kennedy, who defied political tropes and underscored his concern about the poor by taking reporters on treks to rural Appalachia or odysseys to roiling inner cities for speeches on street corners.
With Indiana polls showing the Democratic combatants in a dead heat, and 21 percent of Democrats undecided, this is a perilous time for Obama to lose his fizz.
He tried to recapture the magic — and erase the bowling debacle — by shooting hoops with kids in Kokomo on Friday night.

As a basketball player, he should know he’s in overtime in his race with Hillary — and overtime is not the period to indulge in whining.
Instead of jokingly complaining that babies have learned to walk and talk since he first got in the race, he should remind voters that, if Hillary prevails, some people will slouch toward middle age having never known a White House without a Bush or a Clinton.
Even some Obama fans find Hillary’s toughness and shameless shape-shifting compelling.
Having lost the White House twice to brass-knuckled pols, the Dems may be drawn to a woman who thinks like Karl Rove.

James Clyburn, the influential black congressman from South Carolina, says that some blacks are buying into the 2012 Tonya Harding conspiracy theory: that the Clintons know they can’t beat Obama this time, so they are “hell-bound,” as Clyburn put it, to shred him so he’ll lose to McCain and Hillary will be able to try again in 2012 — when McCain is 76.

In interviews, Clyburn called the tactics of the Clintons and their henchmen “bizarre,” “disingenuous” and “scurrilous.”
Obama is burdened by Jeremiah Wright’s inflammatory remarks on race and his comment to Bill Moyers that Obama “does what politicians do.” And Hillary is burdened by her husband’s inflammatory remarks on race and her own willingness to burn the party to save the party.
The Nixonian Hillary has a ravenous hunger that Obama lacks.
Literally — at a birthday party in Philly for her photographer, she was devouring the chips and dip with two hands — and viscerally.
Accused by an Indianapolis reporter of looking like a GQ cover, he said he has only four pairs of shoes and buys “five of the same suit and then I patch them up and wear them repeatedly.” But his campaign refused to reveal the brand, presumably because it’s not J. C. Penney.

The reaction in the stock market has been positive of late, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising nearly 10 percent since a 17-month low on March 10.
The meeting, on Tuesday and Wednesday, is of the Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the Fed board of governors and the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks.
The committee also lowered the federal funds rate, the rate it charges banks for overnight loans, by three-quarters of a point, to the current 2.25 percent.
Trying to still the chaos in the markets, it left the door open to more rate cuts if necessary.

But two members of the committee dissented, saying that a smaller cut would have been preferable in light of the danger of inflation.
If anything, inflation fears have increased in the last few weeks.
Soaring prices for food, oil and other commodities appear to be inflicting as much pain on Americans as unemployment and the shriveling of the mortgage market.
These trends are certain to be a matter of lively discussion this week.
It is hardly new for the Fed to be caught between a need to lower rates to stimulate the economy and a need to raise them to ward off inflation.
But added to these concerns is the weak dollar, which is helping to push up oil prices because oil is priced in dollars and oil producers are unhappy when cheaper dollars cut into their income.
The cheaper dollar is also leading speculators to buy oil and other commodities, contributing to spikes in food and gold prices.

If the Fed does signal a pause in lowering rates, it will not be welcome among many who feel that, with problems persisting in housing, the danger of a deepening economic slump should be the higher priority.
“It’s our core view that financial conditions remain very stressed,” said Lewis S. Alexander, chief economist at Citigroup.
“If what the Fed does is interpreted as precluding further action, it’s going to hinder recovery of the markets and indicate a more downside risk for the economy.”
A tricky aspect of the Fed’s decision is that the impact of whatever it does may not be felt for more than six months.
Many economists say it takes at least that long for interest rate cuts to have an economic effect.
Similarly, the Fed may be waiting for the first signs of the impact of the tax rebates, which will begin going out this week.
“We’re at the point in the monetary cycle where there are a wide range of opinions,” said Bruce Kasman, chief economist of JPMorgan Chase.
“Most likely, their statement will reflect both sides of the risk spectrum.
Inflation will get its paragraph, but we’ll be hearing about an economy that remains quite weak.”
The passage is rough.

But the migrants are desperate.
One 22-year-old, fleeing open-ended military service in Eritrea, drew a glowing metal rod from the embers and dragged it slowly across his fingertips, searing off his fingerprints.
“It doesn’t hurt,” he said, displaying hands yellow with scar tissue.
Like other migrants interviewed for this article, he would not give his name.
Others, also hoping to dodge the European fingerprint database, use razor blades.
The camps around Calais have become semipermanent way stations on the migration route to Britain from Asia and the Horn of Africa.
Today’s migrants, mostly men in their 20s and many minors, have paid too much and come too far to turn back here, despite their precarious existence.
According to Nazanine Nozarian, of the International Organization of Migration in Calais, which offers about $3,100 to volunteers for repatriation, only 75 migrants agreed to go home last year.
Jean-Pierre Boutoille, a priest involved in local migrant issues for 10 years.
“Now we have 400 migrants at any one time in Calais,” he said.
“Every week some leave and others come.”
Mr. Boutoille, spokesman for the charity umbrella group C’Sur, estimates that 80,000 people — both refugees and economic migrants — from 112 nations have passed through the Calais region since Sangatte’s closing.

Other camps have sprouted up to take its place: the sawmill, a forest of thorns known as “the Jungle,” beside the Tioxide chemical plant, and, until the police burned down shelters there 18 months ago, in the forest of Garennes.
One officer, who would not give his name, said the riot police in the region had two missions: to protect France against terrorism and “to deal with clandestine immigration.”

But they can do little more than harass the migrants.
Arrested migrants are usually issued an expulsion order but often cannot be deported because of cost, an absence of readmission agreements with their countries, or because they face persecution there.
Still, the police arrest as many as possible and, according to migrants and volunteers, regularly assault the camps with tear gas.

Calais, at the entrance to the tunnel under the English Channel, is not alone in dealing with migrants.
They also seek shelter in camps near the eight other ferry ports between France and Britain, said Jean-Pierre Masclet, director of the local branch of Emmaüs, a nationwide foundation for the homeless.
As city, provincial and national governments in France have declined to provide assistance, local aid groups have stepped in.

In a country where housing and transporting undocumented migrants is a crime, punished by fines of about $11,000, the region’s 300 active volunteers say they tread a fine line.
Negotiations with the police have established so-called “calm zones” near a portable shelter and under the Calais lighthouse, where meals are distributed; in December, the charities succeeded in opening a hall for migrants to sleep in when temperatures fall below zero.
But they cannot stop the police from raiding or burning shelters, or driving migrants to the border police station for questioning before freeing them, sometimes without their shoes.
Some migrants wonder, if they are not wanted in France, why won’t the French open the border and let them through?
Mariam Rachil, an administrator at Secours Catholique, dismisses criticism in the British news media that the charities’ recent proposal to open a day center for migrants amounted to a second Sangatte that would encourage more clandestine arrivals.
“Look at La Ceuta and Melilla,” she said, referring to Spanish enclaves in northern Morocco where Africans try to enter Europe.
“There are no charities there and migrants are still coming.”
She added: “You want to know how to resolve the problem of Calais?
Take away the port.”
“It’s like having a fire in a cinema,” said Hyun Song Shin, an economics professor at Princeton.

Faltering confidence could have an infectious effect in Asia, whose savings has essentially bankrolled America for decades.
“Asia, perhaps more than other markets, is a bit more volatile, a bit more based on sentiment,” said Dan Parr, the head of Asia-Pacific for brandRapport, a consulting firm with an office in Hong Kong.
“It doesn’t take much for the man on the street to become very, very concerned.” In early trading in Japan, the Nikkei index fell 3 percent.
Despite government efforts to reassure investors over the last 10 days by rescuing some giant institutions — Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and American International Group — many investors remain worried that the financial system has been badly battered and that more firms may fail as Lehman Brothers did.
The Federal Reserve has greatly expanded its lending to banks and securities firms this year and is continuing to relax rules that govern financial companies in hopes of alleviating the credit squeeze.
Central banks globally are also injecting more money into their economies and lowering reserve requirements for their own institutions out of concern that the problems in the American financial system will inflict further damage.
If the problems in the financial system persist, businesses will have less money to put to work, job cuts will spread and consumers, already fearful, will have less money to spend, knocking the economy down another notch.
High borrowing costs will further weaken the housing market, which is still struggling.
Now, both firms are reconsidering what their best strategies might be in such a fearful market.
In addition to shares of financial companies like Bank of America, those of other bellwethers like General Electric have also tumbled.

Responding to this pressure, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new rules on short selling, or betting on falling share prices, and even suggested that hedge funds and others might have to disclose short positions, a proposal that is likely to meet stiff resistance.

“This is throwing sand in the gears of the economy,” said G. David MacEwen, chief investment officer for the bond department of American Century Investments.
“The economy depends on credit to finance homes, automobiles, student loans, and inventories.”
Local governments and other enterprises will feel pressure, too.
It is so rare for money market funds to fall below that threshold that many investors consider them as safe as cash or a checking account.
The overall effect is to reduce the appetite for securities of companies with anything other than the most stellar reputations.

The Treasury and Fed also said they would auction more Treasury bills.
The Fed will use the securities to manage its balance sheet and inject more money into the financial system.
Because the Fed has expanded its lending to banks and securities firm this year, some analysts had grown concerned that the central bank might run out of Treasury securities to conduct its operations.
Mark Gertler, an economics professor at New York University, said the Fed was trying to balance two interests: protecting against a crisis but telling the market that it will not bail out every troubled institution.
“Maybe this is being Pollyannaish, but they have been successful in signaling that the bailouts are no longer automatic, and thus far they have prevented a market meltdown,” Mr. Gertler said.
The dramatic events of the last year have called into question much of what policy makers, economists and investors once espoused about the financial system.
Now, there are signs that psychology is driving a reverse line of thinking.
People are assuming that things will get worse and that any move by the Fed or the Treasury is a step down, not a step closer to improvement.
“There has been a tremendous amount of denial over the past two years, three years,” said Barry Ritholtz, chief executive of Fusion IQ, an investment firm, and author of The Big Picture blog.
Following are the results of Wednesday’s auction of 35-day cash management bills:
The federal government took two aggressive steps on Friday to restore confidence in money market funds, which consumers have long considered to be as safe as bank savings accounts, but which have come under increasing stress in the current market turmoil.
The Treasury Department announced that, at least temporarily, it would guarantee money market funds against losses up to $50 billion.
“For the next year, the U.S. Treasury will insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund — both retail and institutional — that pays a fee to participate in the program,” the Treasury said in a statement.
And to make sure there is an adequate market if money funds have to sell assets to meet withdrawals, the Federal Reserve said that it would expand its emergency lending program to help commercial banks finance the purchase of asset-backed securities from the funds.

“This action should enhance market confidence and alleviate investors’ concerns about the ability for money market mutual funds to absorb a loss,” the Treasury statement said.
In its statement, the Fed said that it would expand its emergency lending to allow commercial banks to finance purchases of asset-backed paper from money market funds.

Money market funds are essentially short-term mutual funds that invest in government securities, certificates of deposit, asset-backed commercial paper and other highly liquid securities.
They are different from money market deposit accounts, which are offered to consumers by many banks and credit unions.
Those are interest-bearing bank accounts that are insured — up to $100,000 an account and up to $250,000 for some retirement accounts — by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Joint accounts, each account holder is insured for $100,000.
Putnam Investments, one of the oldest names in the mutual fund industry, announced Thursday that it was liquidating its Putnam Prime Money Market Fund, a $12.3 billion fund that serves only professional investors.
With liquidity dwindling in the short-term credit markets — a problem that did not ease significantly in Thursday’s trading — the fund’s board determined on Wednesday that selling assets to meet redemptions would risk losses for the remaining investors, Putnam said.
The company has subsequently imposed redemption limits on 18 money funds it operates.

But new golf courses, maybe, even though he didn’t take up the game until he was 35, and then mainly as a conduit for mingling with bankers.
Mr. Pascucci, himself a father of four and grandfather of 11 who lives in Locust Valley with his wife, Jocelyn, also owns the Long Island-based WLNY, Channel 55, in Melville.
It has been a moneymaker, too.

The property, known as Camp Integrity, had been rezoned for 65 homes; Mr. Pascucci promised that his golf club, besides being environmentally conscientious (no bulldozing of terrain; no chemical runoff), would designate just four acres for hardscape (the clubhouse and guest villas) and donate 54 acres of wetlands, including a beach, to the Town of Southampton.
He also, he says, embellishes his good neighbor posture by paying $500,000 a year in property taxes and opening the club to charitable events five times per season, and not straining the local municipal services.
“You’ve got to be a good steward of what you have,” he says, unembarrassed to have so much of it.
Mr. Pascucci says his wife never complained about the money he poured into his project: “I think she pretty much ignores whatever I do with my business.” He does confess that she, not he, has already had a hole-in-one at Sebonack.
“The drummer for Bon Jovi was in my foursome, and Tucker Frederickson of the Giants happened to be filming us; I’ve heard my hole-in-one has had 100,000 views on YouTube.”
Whether Southampton needed another pricey, private golf course sandwiched between Shinnecock Hills Golf Club and the National Golf Links of America is debatable.
“Why does Sebonack need to exist?” Mr. Pascucci says.
“Because I believe it’s a great idea, if you love golf, to have your own course and build your own membership from people like you.”
Which would be what?
“People who are nonglitzy.
People whose personalities are universally low maintenance, and if some of them happen to have a few bucks, well, you’d never know it.
No one here is an unknown.
There is no bad behavior.” Yes, unlike those hedge fund hucksters who brawl their way around the Bridge.

So the golf legend was taken aback when, after making that hire, Mr. Pascucci informed him he would have a collaborator, Tom Doak, the ecosensitive minimalist who is, as Mr. Pascucci puts it, “the game’s architect du jour.
This was like having two Michelangelos work on the same painting.

Mr. Bernanke stopped short of saying the economy had already fallen into a recession, as some private economists have declared.

Leading Democrats and senior administration officials have argued that a gigantic rescue was unavoidable.
The main fights were over how the program should be supervised and how much financial institutions should put up in exchange for the bailout.
“There is a clear recognition among members of both parties that we must act, and act soon,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat from New York, who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
“It’s not fair.
It’s not right.
But unfortunately it’s the world we live in.”

Mr. Bernanke said recent data hinted at a possible bottoming-out in home sales as buyers take advantage of falling prices.
But he said home builders still have a big backlog of unsold homes and the continued decline in home prices was reducing household wealth and putting pressure on the balance sheets of financial institutions.
Since last September, the Fed has cut the overnight federal funds rate to 2 percent from 5.25 percent, but the central bank has held steady for the last several months.
Officially, the Fed chairman continued to strike a balanced stance on the relative risks of slowing growth and rising inflation.
But the rebates have ended and the outlook for exports has dimmed as global financial conditions have become worse.
“In coming quarters, the contribution of net exports to U.S. production is not likely to be as sizable as it was in the first half of the year,” he told lawmakers.
The Fed chairman spent most of his time defending the proposed bailout for financial institutions.
He brushed aside concerns that the bailout would aggravate inflation or the government’s budget deficit, saying that the government would be acquiring assets that it could eventually resell.
“The net fiscal cost to taxpayers will certainly be much less than $700 billion,” he told lawmakers.
“I think the debt markets will recognize that this debt will be offset by the assets we are buying.”
mi pare sentir odor di femmina!” (“Hush!
I seem to smell femininity!”) Ducking for cover, he waited, and sure enough, Donna Elvira appeared.
This moment usually comes across either as absurdly comic or simply weird.
Don Giovanni can smell women approaching?
“Apparently he can,” Mr. Schrott, 35, said during a recent interview at the Met, following a staging rehearsal.
Recalling that production, Mr. Schrott said, “I can’t tell you how many times a coach or prompter fed me a word, thinking I had forgotten a line.”
The Russian soprano Anna Netrebko was singing Donna Anna at Covent Garden that night.
The two are now engaged; early this month she gave birth to their son, Tiago.
While Mr. Schrott appears at the Met, Ms. Netrebko is at home with the baby in her Vienna apartment.
Mr. Schrott also has a 10-year-old daughter, Iara, who lives in Uruguay with her mother, his ex-wife.
Opera buffs should not expect the pair to become the next love couple, appearing regularly together in productions.
“We actually want to try to avoid it,” Mr. Schrott said.
“She has her career, I have mine.” Of course, he added, “if it happens naturally, fine.”
Mr. Schrott is gratified to be considered a dynamic actor and smoldering stage presence.
But he emphasized that the basic craft of singing is crucial at this stage in his career.
He is determined not to let himself be pushed into vocally inappropriate roles, he said, even if it means restricting his repertory.
Mr. Schrott has sometimes been faulted for letting musical details slip when he becomes swept up in the moment of a performance.
But he has taken that feedback to heart.
Coaches at the Met, where he made his debut in 2000 as Colline in “La Bohème,” report that he is disciplined and focused.
His breakthrough came in 1998 when, after hedging about entering Operalia, the competition run by Plácido Domingo, he won it — both the jury prize and the audience prize.

For years he was content to sing supporting roles.
“It was beautiful to take a character who is not the big deal in the opera, but to make something of it,” he said.
“That is really being an artist.”

Decca has just issued Mr. Schrott’s first solo recording, a program of arias by Mozart, Verdi, Meyerbeer, Gounod and Puccini, with Riccardo Frizza conducting the Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana.
For a singer so naturally spontaneous, the recording process — which requires performing passages over and over to get them right — was initially a “nightmare,” he said.
Actually, the engineers have ably captured the heft, warmth and chocolate-tinged colorings of his voice.
He may have felt constrained singing before microphones in a recording studio.
But his performances have plenty of his trademark impetuosity, and by the end, he was pleased with the results.
Don Giovanni is becoming his calling card, though he also sings Leporello, as he did to acclaim this summer at the Salzburg Festival, which gives him dual insights into the roles.
“I think Leporello understands Don Giovanni better than Giovanni understands himself,” Mr. Schrott said.
He sketched out two frameworks for comprehending their relationship, which he considers a co-dependency.
In one, Leporello is an older, more overtly comic character.
The other is to consider Leporello and Giovanni as having grown up together, servant and master in the same household.
Leporello is jealous of Giovanni’s wealth and elegance, and the beautiful women.
But inwardly he pities his master’s amorality and emotional emptiness.
Mr. Schrott much prefers this second concept, as does his colleague Ildebrando D’Arcangelo, the Italian bass who is singing Leporello in the Met’s production.

Beneath all the banter and horseplay you sensed the tensions and mistrust between this master and servant.
The most fascinating interplay, though, came when the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, singing Donna Elvira, burst into the scene.
What Elvira yearns for here has always seemed elusive.
Getting on her knees, she says that she wants to prove her love for Giovanni one last time.
Does she actually want him back?
Or does she only want him to repent and change his ways?
Ms. Graham explained to her colleagues that as she sees the character, Elvira’s romantic fantasy is over.
She wants to be proved right and for Giovanni to renounce his ways.
Mr. Schrott answered that Elvira may believe this rationally, but that passion and love are beyond reason.
Elvira is still desperate.
Afterward, Mr. Schrott cautioned that when he gets onstage in this scene, despite all the painstaking work, anything can happen in the moment.
“Taking risks is part of the job,” he said.
“Making choices.
You have to.”

But problems lingered in the short-term financing markets, with a benchmark rate for overnight lending between banks remaining near its highest level since 1999.
It remained unclear, however, how far any agreement would go toward resolving the stress that has stopped up credit lines across the globe this week.
Even if the government is able to buy bad assets, “by no means will banks start making a bunch of loans,” said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
The bailout plan, he said, “might save us from a much deeper downturn.
I think that’s really all you can expect from it.”
Still, Mr. Darda warned of the “massive stress” in the credit markets, which businesses depend on for day-to-day costs like utilities and payroll.
While credit is not as tight as last week, banks are still hoarding cash and refusing to lend, cutting off critical arteries of the financial system.
“If we get nothing out of Washington, or it’s botched, then you’re looking at a much more serious downturn,” Mr. Darda said.
To help ease the immense pressures on credit markets, global central banks expanded a program on Friday that lends dollars in major financial centers.

Nonetheless, the financial world found itself once again contemplating both the limits of central banks to break an acute crisis mentality in the absence of a political solution, and the economic consequences of no bailout at all.
“The psychology is that the markets have priced in this plan,” said a senior executive at a major European financial services company, who did not wish to be named because of the sensitivity in the market to the negotiations.
“If that were not to happen I think it would be the beginning of a very serious downturn.”
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index lost 0.9 percent.
The three-month Euribor rate, a gauge of bank lending in the 15 countries that use the euro, jumped to 5.142 percent, its highest level since early 1995.
The six-month Euribor rate, a barometer that straddles the end of the year, when demand for cash is high, dipped slightly after reaching record highs last week.
“I would not say things are getting better.”
Indeed, with credit markets stretched so thin, borrowers and lenders found themselves disregarding the normal information provided by prices because it has become clear that they do not convey the gravity of the situation.
“Liquidity in the money markets in maturities over a week is desperately scarce,” Tim Bond, head of global asset allocation at Barclays Capital in London, told Bloomberg News.
“A near-term solution to the crisis is urgent.
Unchecked, the current crisis would turn into a self-reinforcing vortex of defaults, bank-capital contraction and deep recession within a matter of weeks.”
“We are at such a point of absent liquidity that prices are beginning to fail in their usefulness as a signal,” Claudio Piron, a strategist at JPMorgan Chase in Singapore, told Reuters.
“This in itself is disturbing.”

After a White House negotiating session on Thursday evening that dissolved into partisan rancor, analysts were contemplating the notion that even central banks require a measure of political support to unleash their financial firepower over time.
“Central banks still responding to developments as they crop up,” said Julian Callow, the chief Europe economist at Barclays Capital.
“The question that will be asked is exactly how far this process can go.
However, China’s stock market gained slightly on news that the government would ease requirements for purchasing shares with credit.
“The assumption is that the bailout will take longer than expected, which is negative,” said Tsuyoshi Shimizu, a senior fund manager at Mizuho Asset Management, told Bloomberg News.
“As with Washington Mutual, the longer it takes to pass something, the more victims we’re going to see.”
Investors in Europe shared the sentiment, with major indexes in Britain, France and Germany all off.
“It’s now an issue of political close combat in the U.S. and investors continue to stand back and wait for the outcome.”
It is well to remember that A.I.G.

A few years ago, in a paper titled “Regulation and Reaction,” David Moss and Sarah Brennan (of the Harvard Business School and Columbia University, respectively) recounted the telling experience of New York State banks in the mid-19th century.
Banks in that era issued “notes” that served as currency.
This reduced risk to the system, but it limited the banks’ ability to lend.
The law said nothing, however, about checking accounts.
Harper’s reported that “Wall Street was choked by thousands of people endeavoring to force their way to the banking houses to demand specie” — gold, that is — for their checks.
The lesson, Moss told me, is that “contagion is like a flood.
It finds its way into the part you don’t protect.” In 1929 and its aftermath, that meant stocks purchased on credit and bank deposits.
Today, though banks are under pressure, their depositors sleep soundly.
People lose jobs but they receive unemployment and continue to spend.
But those protections are hardly enough.
Financial innovation ever seeks the freest terrain.
The last generation has witnessed a hothouse of new financial products — really a new, more supple notion of finance, and one that is incredibly complex.
But the basic securities architecture from the New Deal remains unchanged and has even been loosened.
Today, you can enter into a credit-default swap (A.I.G.
wrote billions of dollars worth) even if your capital is insufficient.
Our umpires have been watching the wrong field.
This is not to say that Washington is the main culprit.
But we know that people do foolish things.
Markets almost demand it.
If you are Lehman Brothers and you do not borrow, you do not earn as much as your peers; then your stock falls and you get taken over.
So you borrow.
Only regulation can check this instinct.
Investment banks should be subject to limits on leverage; hedge funds need scrutiny; and more.
Alan Blinder, the former Fed vice chairman, says the next president and Congress will have to redraw the entire regulatory map, because “it’s been shown to be wanting.” Amen.

As the credit crisis has deepened, a consolidation in the financial industry that analysts have predicted for years seems to be playing out in a matter of weeks.
The impact will be felt on Main Street, Wall Street and in Washington.
While the tie-ups may restore confidence in the industry, they also could leave a handful of big lenders to determine fees and interest rates on everything from home mortgages to credit cards to checking accounts.
Some small and midsize banks may be unable to compete with these behemoths.
But a Wells-Wachovia deal also could shift the center of power in the banking industry further from New York.
JPMorgan, which bought Seattle-based WaMu, is based in Manhattan.
But Bank of America, which recently acquired Merrill Lynch, is based in Charlotte, N.C. And Wells, which is seeking to buy Charlotte-based Wachovia, is based in San Francisco.
Wells and Wachovia have been the subject of merger speculation for years.
But Wachovia, like WaMu, has been hobbled by bad mortgages, making a merger more urgent and prompting federal regulators to push for a quick sale.
Wachovia’s share price has plunged nearly 74 percent this year.

Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, personally reached out to executives involved in the process to assess the situation and spur it along.
Both Citigroup and Wells Fargo are deeply concerned about absorbing Wachovia’s giant loan portfolio, which is littered with bad mortgages, these people said.
Citigroup and Wells Fargo were unlikely to bid more than a few dollars per share for Wachovia, substantially less than the $10-a-share price where its stock was trading on Friday, according to people briefed on the talks.
For Wells Fargo, a deal would extend its branch banking network across the Mississippi River, creating a nationwide franchise that would compete with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.
Citigroup executives consider Wachovia a make-or-break deal for their consumer banking ambitions.
If Citigroup were to buy Wachovia, it would gain one of the preeminent retail bank operations after struggling to build one for years.
It would also give Citigroup access to more stable customer deposits, allowing it to rely less heavily on outside investors for funds.
If Citigroup fails to clinch a deal, its domestic retail operations would be far behind Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.
Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup’s chief executive, was personally overseeing the talks.
With a big presence in California, where home prices have fallen particularly sharply, Wells Fargo has suffered big losses on mortgages and credit card loans.
But Wells, unlike many banks, maintained relatively high lending standards, so it has not been crippled by the bust like many of its big competitors.
Wachovia, by contrast, has been ravaged.
Its 2006 purchase of Golden West Financial, a California lender specializing in so-called pay-option mortgages, has proved disastrous.
The bank also faces mounting losses on loans made to home builders and commercial real estate developers, and its acquisition of A. G. Edwards, a retail brokerage firm, turned out to be problematic.
Consumer spending in August turned in the weakest performance in six months, underscoring the threat the economy faces as the government’s stimulus program runs its course.
Analysts are concerned the economy could falter now that the government’s stimulus payments have ended.
Democrats have pushed for a second stimulus program.
The Bush administration, worried about the impact of the stimulus on the budget deficit, has resisted that effort.
Some analysts say they believe consumer spending will decline for the entire quarter, the first time that has occurred since 1991.

Many analysts think the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, will slow to growth of around 1.5 percent in the current quarter and will turn negative in the final three months of this year and the first quarter of 2009, meeting the classic definition of a recession.

There is a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting, in late October, in an effort to prop up the economy as spending sags.
Excluding energy and food, core prices are up by 2.6 percent in the last year, the biggest increase since a similar 2.6 percent rise in the 12 months ended in January 1995.
Economists say they believe that the Fed will discount this jump in inflation when it meets in October to debate the next move on interest rates, given that most signs indicate that inflation pressures are peaking and starting to abate.
She kneaded the dough on her floured kitchen table, gently rocking it back and forth.
I devoured heaping bowlfuls.
Ever since, I’ve dreamed of making manti at home.
But something always holds me back, like the lack of time and two assistants with Turkish dumpling-making skills.
I needed to shorten the process without compromising that savory, near-sacred combination of butter, lamb, garlic, yogurt and more butter.
So I did some online research, typing “manti” and “shortcut” into the search engine.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Entries like “fake manti” and “mock manti” came up, detailing recipes that deconstructed manti-making, reducing it to its essence.
After begging forgiveness for monkeying with a Turkish (and Armenian) classic, bloggers routinely substituted pasta shells for handmade dough, topping them with sautéed ground lamb and yogurt.
Instead of shells, though, I picked up bowtie pasta because I like their crinkled nooks.
Orecchiette would also be a good choice.
After all, what Turkish meal would be complete without one?
Perhaps I’d make a dish to go alongside my rogue entree.

While the pasta boiled, I sautéed the lamb with garlic and shallots, seasoning it with mint.
In Turkey, a particularly fragrant and intense dried mint would be used.
But I had lots of the fresh stuff in the garden, so I threw that in.
It really could have taken twice as much lamb, but it was too late for that.
To compensate, I folded in the roasted eggplant, tossing everything altogether.
As with the manti, butter and yogurt melded into a rich sauce, generously gilding the lamb, pasta and, in this case, eggplant with garlicky abandon.
My cheater’s dish may have lacked the refined velvety character of handmade dumplings, but the flavors I was craving were all there, enticing me to finish mouthful after mouthful until my husband and I polished off a bowl that should have fed four.
So much for leftovers.
Investors were already pivoting their focus to growing evidence that the nation is embroiled in a recession.
Some economists also are predicting the economy will contract in the months ahead.

Those developments did not bode well for the corporate earnings that investors watch closely, creating a dour outlook that helped send stocks lower late in the day.
“Investors still have to face some significant challenges in the broad economy that can’t be magically removed by a group of our Congressional leaders,” said Marc D. Stern, the chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust.
“Investors have to confront a series of unknowns in the weeks ahead that can be disconcerting.”
Also weighing on investors were the strains on the flow of credit, which the bailout bill was intended to relieve.
Analysts said it might take several days before the effect of the bill’s approval could be seen on the credit markets.

It was too soon to tell whether interest rates that banks charge each other for overnight loans — a crucial measure of the flow of credit to businesses and consumers — would fall.
“It is not a panacea,” said Douglas M. Peta, a market strategist at J.& W. Seligman.
“Credit is the lifeblood of the economy.
Until the short-term funding markets start behaving regularly, and until banks are willing to play their role in the system, the direction in stocks is going to be down.”

Mr. Peta said Friday’s stock sell-off “was a rational response when the credit markets are almost practically not functioning.”
A few other factors may have been at play.
The sell-off after the vote on Capitol Hill may have been the result of investors’ tendency to buy on expectations — in this case, that the House would ultimately pass the bill — and sell when the event actually occurs.
“There are two more days that used to be called the weekend, and now are simply two more business days, where important news may develop,” Mr. Stern said, referring to recent developments — the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers; the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America — all of which have occurred on the weekend.
Therefore you need to position your portfolio on Friday to be ready for what happens over the weekend.”
Mr. Stern chuckled.
“In 2008, you have to stay close to your BlackBerry on the weekend.”
The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill rose 6/32, to 103 8/32.
The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.6 percent, from 3.63 percent late Thursday.
Dana Owens of Newark was raised Baptist and named herself Latifah as a child, after learning it was Arabic for “delicate, sensitive and kind.” At 38, she has already had numerous careers.
She released her first album, “All Hail the Queen,” at 19, which, with its hit single, “Ladies First,” established her as rap music’s top female artist, proclaiming a message of self-respect and female empowerment in a genre famous for its misogyny.
In December she will release a new rap CD produced by Cool and Dre.
She was also one of its executive producers, as she is for many of her projects.
With Compere’s help, Latifah still manages her own career; Flavor Unit represents the actor Terrence Howard and the rapper Eve, among others.
She had barely 48 hours before leaving for Toronto, where her newest film, “The Secret Life of Bees,” would have its premiere at the city’s film festival.
The movie is based on the best-selling novel by Sue Monk Kidd and also stars Dakota Fanning, Sophie Okonedo, Alicia Keys and Jennifer Hudson.
It opens Oct. 17.
Traveling with her were Compere and Jarrod Moses, a branding-and-marketing executive who helps manage Queen Latifah’s business with Cover Girl.
“You traveling with the Queen,” she said, laughing.
“They know how to lounge in the Middle East,” she said.
“It’s hot, I get it.
Life is good.”
The Queen (she chose that honorific as a teenager, convinced that all women should feel like queens, even those in humble circumstances) is an expert at chitchat.
The ride flew by.
He has been in business with her and Compere for 10 years.
“They’re very loyal people,” he told me.
He is a massive man with a big smile and a warm heart, but when he positions himself between the Queen and an overly eager fan, he can make your blood run cold.
She doesn’t like Tabasco, so the waiter brought a dish of something green, filled with seeds, from the kitchen.
“That’s exciting,” she panted.

He looked relieved, but he needn’t have worried.
Queen Latifah is no foot-stamping diva.
Her manners toward anyone working in service or support — whether an Amtrak conductor, a waiter, a limo driver, a secretary at Cover Girl or an assistant at Flavor Unit — were impeccable.
While she seems to have learned how to tune out the well-meaning fans who invariably end up being intrusive (even after she says hello, they won’t go away, which is where Sheppard comes in), to every working person she encountered she was completely present and unfailingly polite.
“A lot of these rappers today don’t know how good they have it,” he said.
“We would play Madison Square Garden and then do a rodeo.
“They’re saying, ‘Here she is, the biggest woman in rap,’ ” Compere said, “and where is she?
“He’s finicky, but I’m full of love,” she said, teasingly.
The relationship between the two seems to shift from sister and brother, to star and supplicant, to absent luminary and hard-driving business executive, to wise woman and never-wise-enough man — at least in her opinion.
Compere shows an uncommon grace in being assigned each of these roles, and she seems to appreciate that.
As Compere ate a crème brûlée, Latifah told a story from the Egyptian part of her vacation, about someone selling a beauty cream and giving her the worst hand massage ever.
Compere listened intently, looking at her with undisguised affection and admiration.
It’s the way your real family should look at you but never does.
A client offers to send her specially formulated conditioner to the powers-that-be at Cover Girl.
Was that Latifah’s product placement?
“There was no way I was doing a movie called ‘Beauty Shop’ and they were not going to let me get Cover Girl up in there.” She and Compere have already given the company the script of their next film, “Just Right.” If Cover Girl has a stake, they explained, it might assume some of the promotion costs.
Four executives from Procter & Gamble representing Cover Girl assembled in a large conference room.
Latifah has been a spokeswoman for the company since 2001.
She encouraged it to create the Queen Collection in 2005, knowing how difficult it is for women of color to find enough shades of makeup to match their varying skin tones, especially at drug-store, not department-store, prices.
Though Cover Girl will not disclose earnings for the Queen Collection, the executives said the line is growing faster than any other ethnic cosmetics brand.

“I’m thinking about darkening under the eyes,” Latifah said.
“We should snatch some of those Olay moisturizer ideas for undereye concealer.
Heals while it covers.
“I keep coming back to wipes,” Latifah went on.
“Hair products bleed onto the skin, and I’d like a nice refreshing wipe.
I don’t know how that business works, but we should investigate and see if it’s viable.
It could be packaged in a promotion.
Maybe partner it up with the Lash.
See if people respond to it.” They kept on scribbling.
Two executives narrated a slide presentation, long on platitudes, about who the Queen Collection consumer is and what she wants.
“How taking care of skin now affects how it looks later in life.
Which brings me back to my wipes.
That consumer is me.”
She then reeled off a string of suggestions to reach the consumer through promotions and events.
“What is that exactly?” she asked.
“The latest trend in mass,” she was told, meaning mass market.
“Hey, here’s a happy medium,” she said.
“How about our own mineral wipes?
With those numbers, I think it’s worth investigating.”
The scene became almost surreal, as if this weren’t life at all but one of Latifah’s own movies, where an Everywoman makes her way into the meeting and is effortlessly smarter than the rest.
Think “Working Girl” meets Cinderella, just with Latifah double-cast as her own Fairy Godmother, because as so often happens in her movies, she invents her own rescue again and again.
Off screen, her magic comes the old-fashioned way, from persistent, grinding work.
“I learned early,” she told me, “that I had to work harder than the white kids and harder than the boys.”
“I have 11 ideas here,” an executive marveled, looking at his list.
Next in the presentation was a promotional shot of the four “real” women chosen to be the faces of the Queen Collection.
“There are a lot of hot spots, it’s washed out.
It’s important to me that those natural girls have that transformation.”

Latifah’s final point was the need to expand the brand overseas.
“That’s a good thought,” one executive said, eager to move on.
“I was just in the Middle East,” she said, “and these Saudi women covered up to here are coming over saying, ‘Can I take a picture with you?’ They have on a lot of makeup, don’t be fooled.
They beat that face.
And in London, I couldn’t walk half a block in Brixton without being recognized.
All I’m saying is when I get that kind of attention in two different places like that, how can we brand this Queen Latifah thing?
We need to keep building what we have here.
They assured her they would look into it.
“We love you!” a woman called out.
Cut.
Print.
You could practically see the credits roll.
Shot on location in Hunt Valley, Md.
Flavor Unit Entertainment is housed in a renovated firehouse in Jersey City across the street from an abandoned Manischewitz factory.
In the stairwell hangs a glamorous blowup of Latifah posed next to her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
It was somewhat inevitable that on the second day back from vacation, the star would shine less brightly.
On the walls there were blowups of more photos, including one of Latifah with Oprah Winfrey and Jamie Foxx.
In it, Latifah is appreciably larger than she is now.
Compere sat behind his desk, a flat-screen TV running silently on the opposite wall.
The two meet regularly to talk business, both hers and Flavor Unit’s.
“It is the second time we raised the money outside the studio system.” The story centers on two female cousins.
“One is a professional gold digger whose mission is to hook up with a basketball player and never work again,” Compere said.
“Dana’s character is a physical therapist, who’s a true basketball fan and wants to be a trainer.” Long story short, the gold digger lands the guy, then dumps him when he gets injured and thrown off the team.
Latifah’s character restores his health and his game.
Then the cousin wants him back.
Does he choose her, or the “thicker girl, who’s not a perfect Size 6, ” as Latifah describes her, the one with her own ideals?
Though the film is not yet cast, she can play opposite anyone, it seems.
Perhaps the most unlikely pairing was in “Last Holiday,” in which she portrays a timid saleswoman who is given three weeks to live and who decides to blow her money at a luxurious European resort.
There she becomes the most popular guest and is befriended even by the temperamental French chef, played by Gérard Depardieu.

“Just Right” is tentatively scheduled for a 32-day shoot in New York this winter, though it still has no director.
She made small talk while Latifah ate some shrimp.
“He’s kind of a piece of work,” Chase said.
“He shows up late with an entourage.” Latifah shook her head.
“We don’t need that.”
When they hung up, she didn’t look happy.
“I don’t see this happening before January,” she said.
“Whoever we get to direct will have their own ideas, we’ll have to rewrite.” She sighed.
“I prefer to get it done, knock it out.”
Given all the promotion she’ll have to do until “Bees” opens, along with releasing a new album, can she really shoot a movie too?
“It’s not that much, but at the end of the day I wasn’t out there.” She nodded.
Then he talked about the album cover, which they are hoping Annie Leibovitz will shoot.
“What is your vision for it?” he asked her.
“Works for me,” he said, without missing a beat.
He changed tack: “I have a surprise for you.
Oct. 18 is the BET Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta.
You’re going to perform a new song.” Finally, she smiled.

“So many people who work here grew up with us,” Compere told me, “so we give them an opportunity to start their own businesses.
Any employee who’s been with us over a decade, if they find something they’re passionate about, we become passive investors and part owners.” The latest business to open was Bayonne Chicken and Waffles, which he and Latifah were to visit on her way to the airport.
This meeting clearly could not contain the amount of business they had to conduct.
That dialogue never ends.
“He’s sharp as a basketball, that one,” she snapped.
“Promise me when you’re done you will make this call before leaving the building,” Compere said.
She didn’t answer, seating herself in the glass-enclosed room, which afforded no privacy.
“I found a lot of my mom in this role, which is not something I ordinarily do,” she said of “The Secret Life of Bees.” She plays August Boatwright, a beekeeper and the eldest of three sisters who run a honey business in South Carolina in the early 1960s.
She takes in a motherless 14-year-old and her black caretaker, who have fled their farm town.

“I don’t know if I ever recovered completely,” she said of his death.
“I know I don’t hurt as bad as I used to hurt.
You can’t replace a person, especially someone with a big presence like my brother.

If that’s the price I had to pay, I didn’t want it.

Really?
“Yeah.
I would have this dream at least once a year.
Somebody would have to go.
Did she have to choose?
“I would offer myself, but that wasn’t an option.
I couldn’t choose, but somebody would go off, and I wouldn’t see them anymore.
I would think, How are you going to make it through your life without your mom?
Because sometimes she would just be gone.
You wake up breathing hard.”
She and her mother established a foundation in Lance Jr.’s honor, and each year it provides college scholarships to four students.
She remains close to both her parents, after a period of estrangement from her father during her teenage years.
“He wasn’t there at some points, financially, when we could have used his help,” she said.
He was able to work through that stuff.”
Lance Owens is now a contractor, though he also provides security for his daughter on movie locations and has worked as her driver.
“He doesn’t work for me, he works with me,” she corrected.
“He’s really good at looking at the layout of a location and setting up a plan for proper security.
I don’t put everything on him, though; Keith is my main security.
My father and I are more buddylike.
I can cuss around him.
I wouldn’t even think of doing that around my mother.
My father has always been cool like that.
He’s well traveled; it’s easy to go places with him.
I’m a forgiving person, so I’m cool with it.”
Her equanimity is enviable, though it helps to know that she wasn’t always so together.
She admits to some wild behavior in her youth.

She has learned to be less accessible through the years, refusing to say where she lives in either Los Angeles or New Jersey.
“Some people aren’t wrapped too tight.
You’ve got to be careful.”
Speaking of which, the one imperfection on her otherwise flawless face is the scar front and center at the top of forehead.
Would she say how she got it?
“Playing tag with my brother,” she said.
“Three.
But I didn’t get hit with an iron for coming in late or anything like that.
I probably should have a couple times.”
She maintains strong ties to her family, she said, including aunts, uncles, cousins and her father’s other children, though she says the basis for her self-confidence came from her parents.
“I know people who are twice as creative as I am, twice as smart,” she said, “but they didn’t do anything because they feared going into a room and opening their mouths.
My parents told me to truly accomplish things in my life, there would be times I would have to stand alone.
It may be scary, but that’s what it requires.
I understood where I was coming from, so hopefully, everybody else would get it eventually.”
She generally avoids reading about herself online.
“A lot of people are crazy, cruel and negative,” she said.
I have a limited amount of energy to blow in a day.
I’d rather read something that I like or watch a program I enjoy or ride my damn motorcycle or throw back a couple of shots of tequila with my friends.
Laughing and joking and actually living life.
To sit there reading about myself, I don’t see the point of it.
I’m bein’ myself.”
One topic of persistent speculation on the Web is Queen Latifah’s sexuality, particularly a supposed romance with a female trainer.
She has never addressed her relationships publicly and was in no mood to start.
“I don’t have a problem discussing the topic of somebody being gay, but I do have a problem discussing my personal life,” she said.
“You don’t get that part of me.
Sorry.
We’re not discussing it in our meetings, we’re not discussing it at Cover Girl.
They don’t get it, he doesn’t get it” — she gestured upstairs, toward Compere’s office — “nobody gets that.
I don’t feel like I need to share my personal life, and I don’t care if people think I’m gay or not.
Assume whatever you want.
You do it anyway.”

Clearly, the struggle for privacy is ongoing.
It makes sense that she surrounds herself with friends and family, even on movie locations.
“I meet a lot of new people, which is fun to me, but I don’t roll with a lot of new people,” she said.
“I’m not Hollywood in a sense that I couldn’t wait to get there and hang out with every actress and rapper and entertainer.
I didn’t need all these new people or famous people to validate my existence.
She walked me upstairs so I could say goodbye to Compere.
No sooner had I turned to go than he was at her again about calling the guy she didn’t want to call.
“Dana, come on,” I heard, but the door closed and I couldn’t hear her answer.

Ahead of the interest rate cuts, Hans Genberg, the executive director for research at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said that even if the Federal Reserve were to push down its overnight interest rate — the federal funds rate — financial markets might keep falling and harm to the global economy would not be contained.
“Rate cuts, federal funds cuts, are not going to be enough,” at a time when banks are reluctant to lend to one another, Mr. Genberg said, adding that considerable academic research suggests that the United States must find a way to restore the capital bases of its banks.

“The key lesson is when you face a confidence issue where the market participants no longer trust each other, the conventional macroeconomic tools are not as effective,” he said.
Economists have been gradually reducing their forecasts for economic growth in Asia, and warn that further reductions may be coming soon.
“All the risks to those numbers are very much on the downside,” said Michael Buchanan, Goldman Sachs’s chief economist for Asia except Japan.
Mounting difficulties in European economies are starting to spill over into Asia, where many companies had been trying to step up sales to European consumers before the euro started falling in recent weeks.
“For a long time, I think Asia was hoping exports to Europe would make up for a shortfall in the U.S.,” Mr. Buchanan said.
Robert Cardarelli, a senior International Monetary Fund economist, said at a news conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday that the fund’s recent research showed that during financial crises in which banks are particularly affected, “we are in for a much more severe and protracted downturn.”

But it is the recklessness of his old Wall Street buddies that went far to create this fiscal tumult, which has poked enormous holes in the municipal budget, which has led to the prospect of severe belt-tightening, which has fed the sharp debate over political term limits, which has more New Yorkers snapping at one another than is absolutely necessary, which has...well, you can extend this for as long as you wish.

The concept of sin extends beyond unbridled greed.
It can encompass routine interactions in this crowded, fast-paced city, where people must try hard not to get in one another’s way or on one another’s nerves.
Social harmony requires such efforts.
Transgressions cause real harm.
It is a long-established and essential understanding in New York that double-parkers must leave notes on their windshields telling how they can be contacted.
The tradition, however, is often honored these days in the breach.
“Everybody does it,” she said.
Was this episode a huge deal?
Not at all.
Another common example of fraying is the way some drivers turn sharply into crosswalks, paying no mind to pedestrians who are already there.
It is a singularly mindless, not to mention dangerous, act.
If you think this falls short of qualifying as a sin, you may get an argument from the Vatican.
Last year, it issued a list of guidelines that some have called a Ten Commandments for drivers.
The Fifth Commandment says that a car shall not be “an expression of power and domination.” Three other commandments tell drivers to be courteous and prudent, to protect the more vulnerable party and to feel responsible for others.
You can see how those principles are violated on city streets.
If all the sinners were compelled to repent, every day would have to be proclaimed a day of atonement.
This uncertainty has led to anxiety among our people.
And that is understandable — that anxiety can feed anxiety, and that can make it hard to see all that is being done to solve the problem.
The federal government has a comprehensive strategy and the tools necessary to address the challenges in our economy.
Fellow citizens: We can solve this crisis — and we will.

Here are the problems we face and the steps we are taking:
First, key markets are not functioning because there’s a lack of liquidity — the grease necessary to keep the gears of our financial system turning.
So the Federal Reserve has injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the system.
The Fed has joined with central banks around the world to coordinate a cut in interest rates.
This rate cut will allow banks to borrow money more affordably — and it should help free up additional credit necessary to create jobs, and finance college educations and help American families meet their daily needs.
The Fed has also announced a new program to provide support for the commercial paper market, which is freezing up.
As the new program kicks in over the next week or so, it will help revive a key source of short-term financing for American businesses and financial institutions.
Second, some Americans are concerned about whether their money is safe.
So the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration have significantly expanded the amount of money insured in savings accounts, and checking accounts, and certificates of deposit.
That means that if you have up to $250,000 in one of these insured accounts, every penny of that money is safe.
The Treasury Department has also acted to restore confidence in a key element of America’s financial system by offering government insurance for money market mutual funds.
Thirdly, we are concerned that some investors could take advantage of the crisis to illegally manipulate the stock market.
So the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched rigorous enforcement actions to detect fraud and manipulation in the market.
The S.E.C.
is focused on preventing abusive practices, such as putting out false information to drive down particular stocks for personal gain.
Anyone caught engaging in illegal financial activities will be prosecuted.

Fourth, the decline in the housing market has left many Americans struggling to meet their mortgages and are concerned about losing their homes.
My administration has launched two initiatives to help responsible borrowers keep their homes.
One is called Hope Now, and it brings together homeowners and lenders and mortgage servicers, and others to find ways to prevent foreclosure.
The other initiative is aimed at making it easier for responsible homeowners to refinance into affordable mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
So far, these programs have helped more than two million Americans stay in their home.
And the point is this: If you are struggling to meet your mortgage, there are ways that you can get help.
With these actions to help to prevent foreclosures, we’re addressing a key problem in the housing market: The supply of homes now exceeds demand.
And as a result, home values have declined.
Once supply and demand balance out, our housing market will be able to recover — and that will help our broader economy begin to grow.
Fifth, we’ve seen that problems in the financial system are not isolated to the United States.
They’re also affecting other nations around the globe.
So we’re working closely with partners around the world to ensure that our actions are coordinated and effective.
Tomorrow, I’ll meet with the finance ministers from our partners in the G-7 and the heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Secretary Paulson will also meet with finance ministers from the world’s 20 leading economies.
Through these efforts, the world is sending an unmistakable signal: We’re in this together, and we’ll come through this together.
And finally, American businesses and consumers are struggling to obtain credit, because banks do not have sufficient capital to make loans.
This new law authorizes the Treasury Department to use a variety of measures to help banks rebuild capital — including buying or insuring troubled assets and purchasing equity of financial institutions.
The department will implement measures that have maximum impact as quickly as possible.
Seven hundred billion dollars is a significant amount of money.
And as we act, we will do it in a way that is effective.
The plan we are executing is aggressive.
It is the right plan.
It will take time to have its full impact.
It is flexible enough to adapt as the situation changes.
And it is big enough to work.
The federal government will continue to take the actions necessary to restore stability to our financial markets and growth to our economy.
We have an outstanding economic team carrying out this effort, led by Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, S.E.C.
Chairman Chris Cox, and F.D.I.C.
Chair Sheila Bair.
I thank them and their dedicated teams for their service during this important moment in our country’s history.
This is an anxious time, but the American people can be confident in our economic future.
We know what the problems are, we have the tools we need to fix them, and we’re working swiftly to do so.
Our economy is innovative, industrious and resilient because the American people who make up our economy are innovative, industrious and resilient.
We all share a determination to solve this problem — and that is exactly what we’re going to do.
May God bless you.
Then, serious again: “I’m just not in it to copy something.”

Ms. Maxwell’s modest, small-town origins might come as a surprise to anyone who has seen one of her performances, which have a textured, almost European worldliness to them.
(Her younger brother is the avant-garde playwright and director Richard Maxwell.)

Now 51, she approaches her profession with a mix of practicality and idealism.
She recognizes the need to take jobs to “put the peanut butter on the table” but says she has never once been tempted by the television pilot season and its promise of fame and money, though she has appeared several times on “Law & Order” and “All My Children.” “I’m so hopeless,” she said in mock lament, “I pick up a television script and think: ‘If this were a play, I wouldn’t be interested.
Why do it?’ ”
The plays that do interest her get her full attention.
“I’m like a pit bull on the pant leg of the play,” she said.
“I want to give it it’s shot.
There’s no point to be there if it’s going to be a mediocre venture.
We’re all there for the play, and I think that egos have to go somewhere else.”
That demand for straightforward professionalism (and dislike of egos) possibly fed what, for the nontheatergoing public, is the most notorious episode of her career.
In 2006 she starred with Alec Baldwin in a Roundabout Theater Company production of Joe Orton’s black comedy “Entertaining Mr. Sloane.” She got the tabloid treatment when a personal e-mail message complaining about Mr. Baldwin’s backstage behavior — including punching his fist into a wall — found its way into the press.
While her career has continued to thrive, the incident has had a long shelf life.

Asked whether she would handle the situation differently if given the chance, she fell silent.
“It’s like opening a huge can of worms each time,” she finally said.
“I don’t have the finances or the arsenal of publicists and minions to tell my side of the story.
I just have to know that I did the right thing.” She added with a sigh: “The air that I’m breathing in talking about it now seems to be a waste for me.
I don’t think they’re worth the time.”
The fracas hasn’t dimmed her passion for theater, she said.
Neither has the view that, by her count, only 1 in 10 stage jobs leads to a fulfilling experience.
“I feel very lucky to be an actress,” she said.
“I have no other talents whatsoever.
I’m actually kind of worried about that, to tell the truth.
I’m such a theater bitch that if there’s a hole in the ceiling I’ll just put duct tape over it and say, ‘Wonder how long that’s going to hold?’ ”
A PARTIAL HOLIDAY The bond market will be closed on Monday in observance of Columbus Day, but the stock market will be open.
ECONOMIC INDICATORS The markets and regulators will be watching for signs of inflation and consumer spending this week.
Reports will include the producer price index for September and retail sales for September (Wednesday); the Consumer Price Index for September (Thursday); and housing starts for September (Friday).
CORPORATE EARNINGS Earnings reports will come from BlackRock, Charles Schwab, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo (Wednesday); and Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch (Thursday).
Other reports will come from Philips Electronics (Monday); Genentech, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, and PepsiCo (Tuesday); Abbott Laboratories, AMR, Coca-Cola and eBay (Wednesday); Advanced Micro Devices, and United Technologies (Thursday); and Honeywell International and Sony (Friday).
THE REGULATORS The Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, will speak to the Economic Club of New York (Wednesday).
PepsiCo, the soft drink maker, said it would cut 3,300 jobs and close six plants.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 76.62 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,310.99 points.
In addition, the government said it would insure more bank deposits and debt issued by big financial firms.
Investors said the United States government intervention should help avert a crisis in the financial system by preventing cataclysmic bank failures like the recent bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.
“Everybody expects the government to do something and have the economy pick up in a quarter or two,” said Ira Jersey, an interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse.
“All of this will stabilize the markets, but the real economic issues remain.”
The questions now are how weak the economy will get and how far corporate profits will fall.
Economists estimate that the gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the nation’s economic output — barely grew in the third quarter.
The Commerce Department will release that number on Oct. 30, just before the election.
Companies are just starting to report about their performance in the third quarter, and so far, many blue-chip names have delivered bad news.
Shares of other companies that cater to consumers also fell.

Concerns about technology spending hurt stocks like Microsoft, Intel and Dell, the computer maker.
On Monday, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, warned of a “fairly significant recession” that might drive the unemployment rate to 9 percent, from its current 6.1 percent.

Analysts see a long, tough slog for the economy, because credit will remain harder to get and more expensive for businesses and consumers, relative to the recent years of easy money.
Conditions have improved in some parts of the credit market with interbank lending rates and yields on corporate bonds falling from near-record levels.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, jumped to 4.08 percent, from 3.87 on Friday.
If sustained, that rise in yields could significantly increase the interest rates on home loans.
The average rate 30-year fixed-rate mortgages on Tuesday was 6.6 percent, up from 6.06 percent a week ago, according to HSH Associates, a publisher of data.
Those rates might come down once some new policies kick in.
And the government investment in banks should prompt them to lend more.
Another corner of the market, municipal finance, was also struggling on Tuesday.
Several borrowers like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York and the states of Ohio and Hawaii put off debt sales because they could not lure enough investors.

California has had difficulty raising the short-term debt that it needs to tide the state government over until tax receipts come in this spring.
The state is raising $4 billion and is offering interest rates as high as 4.5 percent.
The state’s big offering, which the state plans for Thursday, has made it difficult for other states and cities to raise money.
“Other than that special situation the market is closed,” said John Miller, chief investment officer at Nuveen Asset Management, an investment firm that specializes in municipal debt.
Yields on municipal bonds jumped to 6.74 percent on Tuesday, up from 5.44 percent a month earlier, according to the Bond Buyer.
Because interest payments on most municipal debt is tax free, Mr. Miller and others are hoping retail investors will jump into the market to buy state and local debt for the higher returns they can now earn.

“Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away,” Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York.
Expectations that a worldwide slowdown will reduce demand for oil pushed prices below $75 a barrel.
Signs of improvement continued in the credit markets, making it somewhat easier for companies and states to secure financing, but interest rates remained elevated.
The United States and many other major economies are almost certainly headed into a slog through economic purgatory, one that could last many months.
“People have focused so much on the immediate financial crisis that they haven’t realized how much the real economy is going down, largely independently,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.
“I don’t think there’s a way we can get out of this without a full-fledged recession and a lot of people losing their jobs.
All we can really talk about is ameliorating it, making sure the people who are hit have support.”
On Monday, as the Dow posted its fifth-largest one-day percentage gain in history, some investors found quantifiable proof that the crisis was solved.
Then, it must be noted, the markets swung far more widely than they do in this era, and an epic collapse would still be required to bring the United States anywhere near a comparable depression.
Mr. Bernanke, a leading academic expert on the Depression, offered pointed assurances that no repeat of that disaster would unfold on his watch.
The Fed stands ready to use all its tools to battle the financial crisis, he said.
He exuded confidence that the American economy “will emerge from this period with renewed vigor.”
But when?
Mr. Bernanke could not say.
That uncertainty added to the gnawing worry gripping the economy.

“Ultimately, the trajectory of economic activity beyond the next few quarters will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning,” he said.
Strikingly, Mr. Bernanke expressed concern about how huge amounts of capital are increasingly concentrated in a handful of enormous financial institutions.

“The real concern that we have is that we have got and developed, in this country, a very serious ‘too big to fail’ problem,” Mr. Bernanke said.
“And that problem, we’ve just recognized now in the current situation, how severe it is.”
It seemed a curious concern for a man whose central bank has worked with the Treasury to engineer a series of shotgun corporate weddings, such as Bank of America’s purchase of Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition of Bear Stearns — deals that have further concentrated money in fewer hands.
Mr. Bernanke’s prognosis and the latest carnage on Wall Street lent urgency to the debate over what the government should do now to soften the blow to the economy.

In Washington, and on the campaign trail, conversation centers on putting together a second round of so-called government stimulus spending, following the $152 billion unleashed this year via tax rebates to households and tax cuts for businesses.
Democrats in the House are drafting a roughly $150 billion package of spending measures aimed at spurring the economy, according to senior aides, including aid for states, large-scale construction projects to generate jobs and the expansion of unemployment benefits.
Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic presidential nominee, is urging $175 billion worth of relief measures.
The Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, has declined to outline his own proposal, though his senior economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said he is “open to any measure that genuinely stimulates the economy.”
Republicans on Capitol Hill have emphasized tax cuts for businesses in any stimulus package, a stance that puts them at odds with Democrats, though recent signs suggest greater potential for a compromise.

“We need fiscal stimulus,” said Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former Treasury and Federal Reserve Board economist, and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
“The outlook is much darker than it was even a few months ago.”
The checks the government sent to households last summer appear to have kept the economy growing, but economists are skeptical such a course could work again.
“The spend rate will be really low because people are scared to death,” Mr. Baker said.
When economists met with House leaders on Monday to suggest a course, the favored means appeared to be aiding state and local governments, whose property tax revenues are diminishing as home values fall.
Local governments are a crucial source of employment and social services relied upon by the poor.
“The states are taking steps right now that are deepening the recession, through no fault of their own,” said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
“They’re forced to either raise taxes or cut services.
Neither of those are where we need to be right now.”
The crisis on Wall Street has sown fears that banks would hold tight to their dollars and starve the economy of capital, preventing businesses from securing finances to hire people and expand.
If the bailout succeeds in restoring confidence, that should eventually get money flowing and lift economic activity.
But regardless of Wall Street’s travails, a broader set of difficulties has been taking money out of the economy, putting the squeeze on American households and businesses.
The economy has lost 760,000 jobs since the beginning of the year, and millions of workers have seen their hours cut, shrinking paychecks just as plunging real estate prices prevent households from borrowing against the value of their homes.
In short, American spending power is declining, and this has become a downward spiral: As wages shrink, workers spend less, and that limits demand for workers at the businesses that once captured their dollars.
Many economists now assume that unemployment, currently at 6.1 percent, will climb to 9 percent by the end of next year.
Some now envision it could reach 10 percent — a level not seen in 25 years.

“At this point, the thing has probably just got to play out,” said Martin N. Baily, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
“I don’t know that there’s anything that we can do to avoid a mild recession.
The question is what can we do to avoid a very severe recession.”
FOR those who championed a hands-off approach to the supervision of finance, the economic meltdown should have prompted reflection on the value of common-sense regulation.
Unfortunately, a growing chorus in conservative circles is trying to shift blame for the current crisis to the poor and the advocates for the poor.
Here’s their story line: our current problems were caused not by people in high finance and government over the past eight years, but powerful antipoverty groups and the Clinton administration, which through their advocacy for the Community Reinvestment Act and homeownership goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bullied a Republican Congress and the titans of Wall Street into bringing global finance to its knees.
There’s only one problem with this story: it isn’t true.
In 2003, President Bush’s chief thrift regulator — holding a chainsaw in his hands as a prop — boasted of his plans to cut banking regulations, including the scope of the reinvestment act and his enforcement staff, which he carried out over the next two years.

If the Community Reinvestment Act caused the subprime crisis, it is hard to make sense of why non-covered lenders drove the growth.
These subprime lenders were competing with more responsible lending under the act by banks and thrifts.
Their loans undid the work of community banks that had been making sound mortgage loans to creditworthy low- and moderate-income borrowers for years.

The second claim from advocates of deregulation is that the roots of the current crisis lie in efforts to encourage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to do more to help low- and moderate-income homeowners.
The assertion is that Democrats encouraged financial recklessness by insisting that Fannie and Freddie fulfill their congressionally mandated public purposes by expanding access to home mortgage loans to non-creditworthy borrowers.
But again, the argument is not supported by the facts.
The Clinton administration explicitly discouraged Fannie and Freddie from buying predatory subprime loans.
There are many lessons to learn from the financial meltdown.
Chief among them is to beware the reckless spending, conflicts of interest and opaque practices of those seeking high profits.
But it is a serious mistake to attribute any of our troubles to consumer protection laws and the actions of those in the nonprofit community with a history of promoting responsible lending to families of moderate incomes.
Peter Baker writes that although Representative Tom Davis is a “star in the Republican Party .
he’s quitting Congress, fed up with his party, his president and the process.” (Oct. 5)
Yet Davis reveals precisely why voters are disgusted with Congress in general and politicians like Davis himself, “star” though he may be.
Referring to George W. Bush, Davis states: “He’s a disappointment.
How else do you say it?” Baker then lists all the reasons for Davis’s disappointment: isolation; poor decisions from advisers; failure to tackle the deficit, Medicare and Social Security; and an absence of leadership.
Yet, shockingly, Davis says, “I would vote for him again against John Kerry; that’s not an issue.” Not an issue?
This is why the nation will be much better off without Davis and his ilk, who put party over country, politics as usual over common sense and expediency over principle.

East Hampton, N.Y.
But editors and publishers at some other papers have become vocal critics of the way The A.P.
operates, saying that it charges more than they can afford, delivers too little of what they need and — particularly galling to them — is sometimes acting as their competitor on the Internet.

“They seem to have forgotten that they are there to serve us,” said Benjamin J. Marrison, editor of The Dispatch.
The A.P.
says it is trying to save money for its more than 1,400 member newspapers, and all the changes under way will benefit them.
is trying to do” and frustration over the papers’ finances.
“I don’t think any of us can ignore the economic circumstances newspapers are in now,” Ms. Carroll said.
“Being the editor of a newspaper in the United States right now is really hard.”
Contractually, newspapers must give two years’ notice to drop the service, so those that recently opted out have until 2010 to change their minds.
A.P.
executives say they suspect that some papers are using that notice as leverage to bargain for lower rates.
In addition to the papers that said they would leave the wire, others are considering it, and still others have set up regional cooperatives meant to supplant part of their relationship with The A.P.
— a trial run for life after the wire service.

Newspapers are going through their most wrenching time since the Depression, with advertising revenue falling about 25 percent over the last two years.
But the balance sheet of The A.P., a nonprofit company, is healthy; last year its profit rose 81 percent, to $24 million, on revenue of $710 million, according to a financial statement issued to its members.
It remains to be seen whether defections become a major problem for The A.P., the world’s largest news-gathering organization with more than 3,000 journalists in about 100 countries.
Without the rich diet of articles, photographs, audio and video it feeds its clients, most American newspapers would be much slimmer and their coverage less expansive.

Newspapers banded together 162 years ago to create The Associated Press.
Only daily papers in the United States can be members, giving them ownership and a vote in elections for the board.
The company has more than 5,000 other domestic clients — broadcasters, Web sites, weekly papers and magazines — and roughly 8,500 abroad.
In addition to the news that A.P.
reporters produce, the wire also takes breaking news articles from its members and distributes them to other clients.
For many members, The A.P.
is one of their biggest expenses.
“We pay in excess of $1 million a year to The A.P., which is equal to 10 to 12 reporters in the newsroom,” said Nancy Barnes, editor of The Star Tribune.
But other A.P.
products, especially photography, would be harder to replace, they said.
Her paper is one of the industry’s most troubled; it recently stopped making payments on its debt.

This summer, dissatisfied with the way The A.P.
handles local news, eight papers in Ohio formed a cooperative to share articles, and some of those papers say they might drop the wire service.
Newspapers in Pennsylvania are exploring a similar arrangement.
“We’re facing terrible economic challenges, so naturally we’re looking at one of our biggest costs,” said David Shribman, executive editor of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
The editors in Ohio, in particular, say The A.P.
has retreated from one of its traditional roles: producing a lot of routine, breaking-news articles.
The A.P.
wants to make its work more engaging, with more enterprise journalism like features, investigations and analyses — but that is also the direction many papers are going.
“Then The A.P.
rewrites our story and sends it out,” he said.
“So we’re sacrificing our enterprise so that A.P.
can do its enterprise?
No, no, no.
We’re the owners.”

Ms. Carroll of The A.P.
said it had only “trimmed back on things that weren’t getting much use.”
“We’re not trying to absolve ourselves from nuts-and-bolts news, but we cannot survive if we are spending our day doing the mark-up of some legislative measure that is of interest to one part of the state but not another,” she said.
The A.P.
does not release details about what clients pay, but newspapers’ fees vary based on their circulation and the services they receive.
For the last three years, the company has held those fees flat.
The A.P.
says the fees are partly subsidized by the higher prices it charges to nonmember clients, which account for about three-quarters of its revenue.
The A.P.
says that a new price structure, set to go into effect in January, will give papers a 10 percent price cut on average.
Papers object to a requirement that they allow The A.P.
to apply its electronic tags to the articles they publish in order for the papers to qualify for the discounted fees.
The tags are bits of computer code, invisible to readers, that are intended to make Web pages rank high in Internet searches.
While The A.P.
says that most member papers have signed up for the tagging program, the largest newspapers, including The New York Times, have developed their own tagging systems and so far have not switched to The A.P.’s.
The A.P.
To some newspaper executives, the mobile service looks like a bid by The A.P.
to make money from their work — and to compete with the papers’ own mobile services.

“If you want our content, you should have to come to us for it,” said Ms. Barnes of The Star Tribune.
Similarly, some editors and publishers dislike The A.P.’s practice of selling a news service to aggregators like Google and Yahoo; they want their own articles on those sites instead.
Jim Kennedy, an A.P.
vice president and its director for strategic planning, said that papers should not see The A.P.
as a competitor.
He said the mobile network would share ad revenue with participating papers — many of which do not have the resources to develop such services — and drive Internet traffic to those papers.
“We’re trying to be the portal, linking back to the contributors,” he said.
“We know there are members who would rather we didn’t license our content to Google,” he said, “but the money The A.P.
gets from that helps defray the costs that members don’t pay.”
“Fortunately, for us, we’ve got one more game to try and break out.”

If players go four games without a hit during season, it is a footnote.
But if they do it in the World Series, as Peña and Longoria did, it is worth a headline.
The headline about how Longoria, Peña and the Rays are fading away is now in bold type.
“I don’t want them to look too far in the future,” Manager Joe Maddon said.
“Just win tomorrow.”
While comparing the Rays’ lineup to the failing stock market, Peña said he would “buy” in Tampa Bay and believed that “we just got to keep coming with our approach.”
That approach is not working.
Both players have slumps that extend beyond the World Series.
Peña is 0 for his last 21 and has not had a hit since the fifth game of the American League Championship Series.
Longoria is 0 for 17 and last had a hit in the decisive game of that series.
Before Sunday’s game, Maddon spoke to Peña and Longoria about being cognizant of not expanding their strike zones.
Maddon said hitters often feel that they must make technical adjustments during slumps.
But Madden said that a mental adjustment in which Peña and Longoria “get back to their strike zones” could be the answer.
Now the Rays are reeling and talking tough about maintaining a postseason pulse.

“We’ve come back from so much,” designated hitter Cliff Floyd said.
“It’s just been the year that, if you doubt one minute in this team, you’re a clown.
What we’ve come back from, you have to literally beat us down and tell us we’re going home.

The Rays were resourceful in scoring seven of their eight runs in Games 2 and 3 on outs, but it was risky for them to expect that they would continue to manufacture runs.
The Rays are still waiting.
“This is what baseball is meant to be like,” Longoria said.
“Obviously, it’s going to be a whole lot tougher to play on the road than it is at home.
The Phillies mostly attacked Peña with inside fastballs under his hands, which prevented him from extending his swing and using his power.
Other than Brett Myers throwing four straight curveballs during an at-bat in Game 2, Peña has usually not faced breaking pitches until later in the count.
Longoria hit a deep foul ball into the left-field seats off Ryan Madson’s fastball on Sunday before whiffing on a changeup.

BEIJING (AP) — China cut key interest rates for the third time in six weeks on Wednesday in a bid to spur growth amid fears of a global recession that would hit its vital exports.
China trimmed the rate on a one-year loan by 0.27 percentage points to 6.66 percent, adding to official efforts to revive slowing economic growth and help struggling exporters.
Both cuts will be effective on Thursday.
The cuts come as the Federal Reserve and European central banks scramble to cut rates to shore up investor confidence.

China has been largely unaffected by the credit crisis that crippled Western banks and roiled global markets, and is more concerned about a longer-term downturn in economic growth.

Economists have cut growth forecasts for China this year to as low as 9 percent, down from last year’s 11.9 percent.
That would be the highest rate for any major country, but communist leaders want to keep growth robust to reduce poverty and avoid job losses, which could fuel political tensions.
It had gained 2.8 percent on Tuesday, tracking a regional recovery.
China’s changes in interest rates and reserve levels usually are much smaller than those of other major economies.
Economists say they have little direct effect on credit and are meant as signals to banks to curb or loosen lending.
BEIJING — Nine families with babies suffering kidney problems filed separate lawsuits on Wednesday against one of China’s largest milk companies, lawyers representing the families said.
They are the latest lawsuits to be filed in the tainted-milk scandal, China’s worst food-safety episode in years.
The lawsuits demand compensation from the milk company, Sanlu Group, and were filed in the northern city of Shijiazhuang, where Sanlu is based.
The milk scandal and the lawsuits are politically fraught, and so far no judge has agreed to hear a case in court.
Product liability lawsuits and class-action lawsuits are rare in China.
Some legal scholars say that leaves Chinese consumers with one less layer of protection against defective practices by big companies if the governmental regulatory processes fail, as they have in many recent food and product safety cases.
At least four babies have died and at least 53,000 other children have fallen ill, according to reports from official news agencies.
Since then, a wide range of food products from China have been discovered to contain melamine, including those made with milk products, like yogurt and cookies, prompting countries around the world to recall Chinese-made food products.
More recently, tainted eggs have been found, raising the possibility that chicken feed was being doctored.

Senior government officials and company executives have been fired as the scandal has widened, and dozens of people have been arrested.
The nine families involved in the latest round of lawsuits, who are from several provinces, hope that the central government will eventually provide some sort of compensation for the ill children, said Ji Cheng, a lawyer with the Deheng Law Office, a large firm based in Beijing that is representing the nine families.
The families have kept hospital records and complete records of their purchases of Sanlu baby formula, he added.
The families are asking Sanlu for at least the equivalent of $2,000 per child in compensation payments.
The Chinese legal system allows class-action suits, but onerous rules put in place in recent years by official legal bodies have made them difficult to file.
Some lawyers have been discouraged from representing families seeking damages.
In the first weeks of the scandal, more than 100 lawyers put themselves on a list of lawyers volunteering to dispense legal advice to the families.
But at least two dozen have since dropped their names from the list; most are from Henan Province, where lawyers have complained of subtle pressure from local officials.
This was the first interest rate cut during the current financial crisis by Japan, where near-zero short-term interest rates have constrained the central bank’s room to maneuver.

Bank officials have said they feel hard pressed to find ways to coordinate with the Fed, which cut rates earlier this week, and other central banks in combating the downturn.
Borrowing rates have been stuck at low levels here for more than a decade because domestic growth in Japan’s export-driven economy never fully recovered from the collapse of the late-1980s real estate and stock market bubbles.
The central bank had until now limited itself to less drastic moves, like supplying dollars and yen to money markets to ease the global credit crisis.
But they said the small size of the move would make it unlikely to stimulate much of an increase in actual borrowing.
Japan’s stock market reacted badly to the rate cut, sending the benchmark Nikkei 255 down 5 percent on Friday.

“The bank is making an effort to offset some damage from declining exports,” said Richard Jerram, an economist in Tokyo for Macquarie Securities.
“But a cut of this size is not really going to change anybody’s world.”
With low interest rates and a huge deficit, Japan has few real options for stimulating its $5 trillion economy, the world’s second-largest after the United States.

The government has released a series of spending packages, including one Thursday valued at $51 billion that would give income tax rebates to households.
With the United States now apparently heading into recession, Japanese policy makers have looked for ways to pick up some of the slack in global growth.
But like many Asian countries, it appears highly vulnerable to the slowdown in the United States because of its reliance on exports and relatively weak consumption at home.
The Bank of Japan cited declining demand in the United States in particular in making its forecast of no growth for the rest of this year, followed by around 0.5 percent next year.
The central bank also decided to lower the so-called Lombard rate, the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks, by a quarter percentage point, to 0.5 percent.
As Japan’s economy has faltered, there have been increasing complaints by smaller businesses that they are having trouble obtaining new loans.
The decision to pay interest on reserves at the central bank is meant to combat this by effectively stuffing private banks with additional cash, in hopes that they will lend more of it to businesses and consumers.
According to Mr. Jerram of Macquarie, one lesson of Japan’s experience with such indirect measures is that they work only if bankers are confident that they will remain in place until the economy actually revives.
To make this clear, he said, the bank should accompany such an easing with public commitments not to raise borrowing costs again until some target is met, like a rebound in consumer prices.
Because peer-to-peer student lending is so new and so little data is available, it’s impossible to know how many students are getting loans or to predict whether this option will ever be a major source of money for college.
That’s certainly not likely for many years, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org.

The companies take different approaches.
Virgin Money (virginmoneyus.com), Richard Branson’s foray into lending, focuses on formalizing and servicing loans among friends and family members.
On Fynanz.com, strangers are the target lenders, and student profiles — brief and jazzy personal statements and photos — the lure.
(Tip from the C.E.O.’s: sob stories don’t work.)
Lenders can spread their money around, offering as little as $50.
Click around and weigh the merits of lending to Keith, the Occidental College student seeking $17,000 for a semester in Chile; or the 42-year-old single mother who needs $7,000 to go back to college to become a nurse; or the Columbia freshman Dominique, who has plans for medical school but right now needs $5,500 for books and expenses.
Of course, the loans are unsecured and few students have credit track records, so lenders must judge the likelihood of a default.
GreenNote.com, whose interest rate is fixed at 6.8 percent, does not do credit checks but disburses money only to the college.
As does Fynanz.
But Fynanz has developed its own rating system for borrowers: students must have a credit score of 640, and are graded — and their interest rates set by a calculation that includes year in college (the closer to finishing, the better), G.P.A.
Fynanz guarantees 50 to 100 percent of the loan depending on a student’s grades.
(Less risky students give investors more peace of mind but lower returns.)
The average interest rate, says Chirag Chaman, who runs Fynanz, is 8 to 9 percent.
Prosper.com, the nation’s largest peer-to-peer site, is currently tweaking its model.
Because peer-to-peer sites will undoubtedly attract more would-be borrowers than lenders, Prosper is hoping to grow by creating a market in which lenders can sell the loans they make rather than having to hold them to maturity, following the lead of a rival, the Lending Club.
Until Prosper receives regulatory approval, it announced last month, it is not processing any new loans.

Most companies won’t disclose the dollar amounts committed; the exception, Virgin Money, reports assisting with $12 million in student loans since June, when it began offering them.
Robert Shireman, president of the Institute for College Access and Success, calls the whole idea “potentially interesting” but says that because of the high risk of lending to a student, “the peer-to-peer approach only really works if there is some level of charity.” As for borrowers, he urges students to look carefully at fees.
There’s generally no listing charge, but often a flat fee, or a fee based on a percentage of the loan, or a transaction fee with each payment.
Perusing the lending sites also makes clear how many students needing support are not finding it.
At GreenNote, for example, page after page shows students with zero progress — in early fall, the tail end of the loan season, the sites featured as many as 1,000 profiles.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The ability to find a lender may also reflect a student’s connections.
Akash Agarwal, GreenNote’s founder, says on his site, “A lot depends on the person’s social network.”
For some that’s a problem.
Bakari Pace, a sophomore at Morehouse College who plans to go to law school, would seem a good bet for success.
One of five children in a family that survives on donated food, Mr. Pace was short of money.
In August, he put his profile on GreenNote, seeking a $10,000 loan, but received no offers: none of his contacts have any money, either.
Financial aid officers eventually found scholarships to cover his costs — for this semester.
For students like Mr. Pace, peer-to-peer lending may not be the best answer.
“I hope this takes off and works well,” says Richard Toomey, head of financial aid at Santa Clara University in California.
With some students paying 10 to 20 percent interest for private loans, he sees GreenNote as a cheaper option; its rate is the same as a federal Stafford loan.
Mr. Toomey says 26 Santa Clara students have profiles on GreenNote, and four have received loans.
He personally “invested” $100 in a student whose story he found compelling.
The peer-to-peer C.E.O.’s say students are more likely to get money if they ask for less.
“If you write that I am only looking for $4,000 to pay for X, Y and Z, it sits a lot better than if you try to get $15,000,” Mr. Chaman says.
Three New York University alumni, he says, have committed to making $500,000 in loans to N.Y.U.
Crystal Gnemi, a University of Kansas senior majoring in arts and architecture, credits her snappy profile for helping her get a $7,000 loan in 48 hours on Prosper, which uses an eBay-like bidding system for interest rates.
Lenders offer amounts at particular interest rates; those with the lowest rates get in on the deal.
“while working 30-hour work weeks while taking 18 credit-hour semesters.”
Ms. Gnemi, whose father is an architect and mother a substitute teacher, does not qualify for need-based aid.
Though she works as a lifeguard and interior designer, she needed a loan to cover tuition and costs.
A bonus: e-mail notes from 17 Kansas alumni.
“I have zero friends and zero family investing,” she says.
“It is fully funded by people I do not know, but have become friends with since.”
For the generation of young Spaniards who have known only good economic times the chill is shocking.
“Maybe older people are not surprised, but this is totally new for me,” said Francisco Braulio, 31, who works for Valeo Termico, a parts makers that supplies the General Motors plant here, the automaker’s largest factory in Europe.

Mr. Braulio and his wife, recently married, have put off talk of having children for now and to save money they are eating meals and watching movies at home rather than going out.
Zaragoza’s fate echoes the pattern now unfolding across Spain and the rest of Europe.
Despite highly publicized interest rate cuts and more than a trillion euros in loan guarantees and capital injections by governments from London to Frankfurt, the situation is expected to only get worse.
European consumer confidence plunged in October, hitting its lowest point in 15 years.
“It’s come very suddenly,” said José Mendizábal, chief executive of Pikolin, Spain’s biggest mattress maker and one of the largest private employers in this area.
“People are frightened of spending money.”

Pikolin has already eliminated temporary positions, bringing its work force down to 1,200 from 1,400.
But the slowdown has intensified in recent weeks, with sales now off 15 percent from a year earlier, and more job cuts are likely if sales do not improve.
Mr. Mendizábal said his customers are a barometer of the broader economy.
First-time home buyers are in the market for lots of new furnishings while homeowners with discretionary income buy when they feel flush.
Now, he said, the former have nearly disappeared and the latter “are hanging on to their old mattresses.”
With consumers pulling back, governments that just finished bailing out the financial system are now looking to help the broader business sector.
There is little doubt that both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will cut rates again this week.

Indeed, Europe’s entire auto sector is now suffering, with Daimler cutting its 2008 earnings forecast by 1 billion euros in late October, while Renault and Fiat have also issued profit warnings.
“In the past, you could forecast demand for a quarter,” Mr. Rytwinski said.
“Then in the summer, for about a month.
Now, we’re talking about weeks.”
The arrival of G.M.
With roughly 1 billion euros provided by the Spanish government and other sources to build everything from a glistening new bridge designed by Zaha Hadid to sprawling pavilions and new parkland along the Ebro river, the future looked bright even as troubles were growing elsewhere.
At 62, Mr. Franco has watched Zaragoza, along with the rest of Spain, transformed by prosperity.
“People have changed,” he said.
“In my generation, we said, ‘One city, one wife, one company.’ My children’s generation is quite different.”
Ibercaja, with its fairly conservative lending practices, remains one of Spain’s strongest savings banks.
But Mr. Franco is surprised at how much attitudes toward debt shifted during the boom.
But in recent years, he said shaking of the head, people even “borrowed to go on holiday.
That’s American.”
Roque Gistau, the president of the 2008 Expo, now finds himself trying to fill the 1.8 million square feet of office space constructed for the exhibition.
He claims about 60 percent has been sold, but confessed it is taking a long time to find buyers for the rest.
“In the last three months, sales have come to a complete standstill,” he said.
“A year ago, I was sure we’d sell 100 percent.”
With the expansion, joblessness in Zaragoza and the surrounding Aragón region fell well below Spain’s traditionally high unemployment rate, which now stands at more than 11 percent.

But Alberto Larraz, Aragón’s economic minister, said he expected the local jobless rate to rise from its current 6.2 percent to near 8 percent by the end of the year, with no improvement in 2009.
While younger workers like Mr. Braulio say they are pessimistic about the future, older Spaniards like Mr. Gistau say they remain hopeful that it will be only a matter of time before the good days return.
Citing an old Spanish proverb, Mr. Gistau said, “There is no evil that lasts for 100 years.”
That out-of-control innovation is reflected in the growth of securities intended to spread risk widely through the use of financial instruments called derivatives.
In recent years, these swap contracts have been used to insure all manner of instruments, including pools of subprime mortgage securities.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
These swaps are contracts between two investors — typically banks, hedge funds and other institutions — and they are not traded on exchanges.
The face value of the credit-default market has soared to an estimated $55 trillion.
Credit-default swaps, though intended to spread risk, have magnified the financial crisis because the market is unregulated, obscure and brimming with counterparty risk (that is, the risk that one embattled bank or firm will not be able to meet its payment obligations, and that trading with it will seize up).
The market for credit-default swaps has been at the center of the recent Wall Street banking failures and rescues, and these instruments embody the kinds of risks not easily captured in math formulas.
“Complexity, transparency, liquidity and leverage have all played a huge role in this crisis,” said Leslie Rahl, president of Capital Market Risk Advisors, a risk-management consulting firm.
“And these are things that are not generally modeled as a quantifiable risk.”
Math, statistics and computer modeling, it seems, also fell short in calibrating the lending risk on individual mortgage loans.
In recent years, the securitization of the mortgage market, with loans sold off and mixed into large pools of mortgage securities, has prompted lenders to move increasingly to automated underwriting systems, relying mainly on computerized credit-scoring models instead of human judgment.
So lenders had scant incentive to spend much time scrutinizing the creditworthiness of individual borrowers.
“The danger is that the modeling becomes too mechanical.”
Mr. Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, points to a new paper co-authored by a University of Chicago colleague, Amit Seru, “The Failure of Models That Predict Failure,” which looked at securitized subprime loans issued from 1997-2006.
But the analysts themselves assigned a very low probability to that happening.

The miss by Wall Street analysts shows how models can be precise out to several decimal places, and yet be totally off base.
The analysts, according to the Fed paper, doggedly clung to the optimists’ mantra that nominal housing prices in the United States had not declined in decades — even though house prices did fall nationally, adjusted for inflation, in the 1970s, and there are many sizable regional declines over the years.

But, he added, it is also true that asset price trends are difficult to predict.
“The price of an asset, like a house or a stock, reflects not only your beliefs about the future, but you’re also betting on other people’s beliefs,” he observed.
“It’s these hierarchies of beliefs — these behavioral factors — that are so hard to model.”
Indeed, the behavioral uncertainty added to the escalating complexity of financial markets help explain the failure in risk management.
The quantitative models typically have their origins in academia and often the physical sciences.
In academia, the focus is on problems that can be solved, proved and published — not messy, intractable challenges.
In science, the models derive from particle flows in a liquid or a gas, which conform to the neat, crisp laws of physics.
Not so in financial modeling.
Emanuel Derman is a physicist who became a managing director at Goldman Sachs, a quant whose name is on a few financial models and author of “My Life as a Quant — Reflections on Physics and Finance” (Wiley, 2004).
In a paper that will be published next year in a professional journal, Mr. Derman writes, “To confuse the model with the world is to embrace a future disaster driven by the belief that humans obey mathematical rules.”
Yet blaming the models for their shortcomings, he said in an interview, seems misguided.
In boom times, new markets tend to outpace the human and technical systems to support them, said Richard R. Lindsey, president of the Callcott Group, a quantitative consulting group.
Those support systems, he said, include pricing and risk models, back-office clearing and management’s understanding of the financial instruments.
That is what happened in the mortgage-backed securities and credit derivatives markets.
Better modeling, more wisely applied, would have helped, Mr. Lindsey said, but so would have common sense in senior management.
“If you are making a high return, I guarantee you there is a high risk there, even if you can’t see it,” said Mr. Lindsey, a former chief economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr.
Lo, the director of M.I.T.
Laboratory for Financial Engineering, co-wrote a paper that he presented in October 2004 at a National Bureau of Economic Research conference.
The research paper warned of the rising systemic risk to financial markets and particularly focused on the potential liquidity, leverage and counterparty risk from hedge funds.

Over the next two years, Mr.
The dismissive response, Mr.
The path to sensible restraint, he said, will include not only better risk models, but also more regulation.
Like others, Mr.
Lo recommends higher capital requirements for banks and the use of exchanges or clearinghouses for the trade of exotic securities, so that prices and risks are more visible.
Any hedge fund with more than $1 billion in assets, he added, should be compelled to report its holdings to regulators.
Financial regulation, Mr.
Lo said, should be seen as similar to fire safety rules in building codes.
The chances of any building burning down are slight, but ceiling sprinklers, fire extinguishers and fire escapes are mandated by law.
“We’ve learned the hard way that the consequences can be catastrophic, even if statistically improbable,” he said.
“Normally markets are driven by fear and greed,” said Brian Gendreau, a strategist at ING Investment Management in New York.
Those reports have been arriving almost daily for the last few weeks, signs of a recession that many fear will be darker than anyone imagined just a year ago.

Instead, investors appear to be betting that the worst is yet to come.
Stocks that rallied after hitting a year-to-date low on Oct. 27 are heading south again, veering toward a new bottom.
The trends suggest that investors remain remarkably skittish.
Shares of banks fell on Thursday by 7 to 10 percent, single-day swings that would have been unthinkable a short time ago.
These days, fleeting headlines can move the market just as much as interest rate cuts and major economic data.
On Thursday, the bad news came in the form of slumping sales at the nation’s retailers, a harbinger of a holiday shopping season that could be the worst in years, according to industry analysts.

Investors may also have been selling ahead of Friday’s report on the job market, which economists say will be grim.
The Labor Department is expected to report that employers cut hundreds of thousands more jobs in October, bringing the simmering problems in the labor market to a full boil.

“But there is attention being paid to tomorrow’s jobs numbers.

The declines on Wall Street came despite sharp reductions in foreign interest rates by central banks seeking to further ease the tight credit markets.
The amount of outstanding commercial paper — short-term i.o.u.’s used by businesses and banks for daily expenses — were up for a second week, rising $50.5 billion, to $1.6 trillion.
That is down from the peak in July 2007, but a significant improvement from last month, when the market for such financing virtually froze up.

European Union leaders want an international summit meeting scheduled for next week in Washington to establish a swift timetable for strengthening the International Monetary Fund, reshaping financial governance and imposing greater regulation on the sector.
While seeking to pressure Mr. Obama to address the issue early in his term, the 27 European nations whose leaders met here in Brussels nonetheless watered down several French proposals that would have pressed the United States and other members of the G-20 rich and emerging economies to agree to a series of changes when they meet Nov. 15.
Several leaders have compared it to Bretton Woods, the international conference that created the post-World War II financial structures.
But with the United States to be represented by President Bush, and only limited discussion with leaders of emerging economies, Europeans now accept that agreement on a range of principles — and a timetable — is the most that can be achieved next week.

President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, which holds the European Union’s rotating presidency, said he had spoken with Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama and added that the world “could not wait” until the inauguration of the next president on Jan. 20 before taking action.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain highlighted the need for governments to bolster the real economy and try to prevent a deep recession from taking hold.
“Coordinated action on interest rates should be complemented by action on fiscal policy,” Mr. Brown said.
The Washington meeting, Mr. Brown added, will come at a “decisive moment for the world economy,” adding that “the decisions we take in the next few months will reshape our world for a decade or more.”
European nations have conducted intense diplomacy in the last week, both about who should go to Washington next week and how detailed a plan Europeans should push.
Mr. Sarkozy presented the summit meeting as an opportunity for Europeans to mold the debate because the era of the dollar as the only global currency had “come to an end.”

An overhaul of the International Monetary Fund has, however, emerged as a central preoccupation among European leaders.
Some nations see the monetary fund as the central bank of the central banks, others as the repository of a large stabilization fund and others as an agency that would warn nations if their approach was threatening international stability, Mr. Sarkozy said.
The 27 nations agreed, however, that the monetary fund should become the “pivot of a renewed international system” and should coordinate more closely with the Financial Stability Forum, which aims to promote international financial stability through information exchange and cooperation in supervision and surveillance.

Some diplomats were skeptical that the United States would agree to commit itself to specific measures during a time of political transition.
The principles put forward by the Europeans on Friday include regulation, “or at least oversight,” of all financial institutions, accountability and transparency, new approaches to risk assessment and a central role for the monetary fund.
The government in Berlin took the view that this might imply too great a role for the European Union in economic affairs at the expense of national governments and an independent European Central Bank.
It opposes some of the details of a proposal to legislate in this area.

HONG KONG — Macao, the former Portuguese colony on the coast of southern China, has all it takes to compete with the gambling capitals of the world — glamour, gaming-crazed customers and, as of last year, its own version of Venice’s Rialto Bridge.
Macao, now a special administrative zone within China, has become synonymous with the economic success of the country’s growth.
The enclave’s prospects have drawn major investments in casinos from Western investors like the American billionaire Sheldon G. Adelson.
But as China’s growth cools amid a global slowdown, Macao’s gambling revenue is no longer growing as fast as it once were, and competition between the growing number of casinos is fierce.
Now the downturn has claimed a prominent victim: the Las Vegas Sands, the struggling casino operator run by Mr. Adelson, said it was suspending construction on sites in Macao as it struggled to meet financing obligations.
But gambling revenue dropped to $3.2 billion in the third quarter, 10 percent lower than the previous period.

“Given the current conditions in the global credit environment, we have elected to significantly slow the pace of our development activities” in Macao, William Weidner, president and chief operating officer of Las Vegas Sands, said Monday.
The decision by the Las Vegas Sands to stop work is partly because of problems elsewhere, and the drop-off in the Macao gambling boom has been aggravated by Chinese travel restrictions as the authorities seek to curb money laundering.
But Macao’s — and Sands’ — difficulties are emblematic of the downturn of the Chinese economy.
For a decade, China has been powering ahead at 10 percent growth or more, which until recently had fueled fears that the supercharged economy was overheating.
The global downturn has taken its toll on China, slowing its pace of growth to 8 percent or less this year, and prompting an economic stimulus package worth some $586 billon.

Exports rose more than expected, by 19.2 percent from a year earlier, holding up relatively well in the face of the global slowdown.
“Domestic demand is slowing faster than external demand in China, and although export growth held up relatively well, the worst here is still to come,” Tao Wang, an economist at UBS in China, said.
This is now one of the government’s main areas of action.
Although details on the breakdown are lacking, the package focuses on infrastructure spending — airports, subways, railroads — which will clearly bolster the beleaguered sector.
But, said Ms. Wang, the impact of the stimulus package will not be felt for a while: “It will take until the second half of next year until we see a recovery in housing and construction,” she said.
Until then, as growth continues to slow, the authorities are likely to come up with yet more stimulative measures.
Many economists say they believe the authorities, who have already cut rates three times since mid-September, will do so again soon.
Falling inflation permits the government to put in place “proactive fiscal policy and appropriately accommodative monetary policy,” said Ting Lu and T. J.
Bond, economists at Merrill Lynch, in a research note, adding that they expected more interest rate cuts in the months ahead.
And comments by Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, that the government’s economic stimulus package would seek to help the real estate sector could foreshadow further policy steps to encourage private sector investment in housing, Ms. Wang said.
The market’s abrupt about-face left investors and analysts grasping for explanations.
“The markets have two minds here,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.
“On the one hand, the data continues to be terrible.
Bargain hunters, sensing that the market was retesting its bottom, began buying and did not stop.
Crude oil prices and energy stocks, which have tumbled in recent weeks on fears of falling demand, rebounded on Thursday.
Even shares in retailers like Kohl’s, Macy’s, Gap and American Eagle, which are facing a bleak holiday shopping season, ended higher.

“Historically, recessions preceded by episodes of banking-related financial stress have tended to be more profound and long-lasting,” said Martin van Vliet, an economist at the Dutch bank ING.
“Consequently, it seems overwhelmingly likely that the current, credit-crisis induced downturn is going to be more painful than the previous one in 2001 to 2002, after the dot-com bubble burst.”

Still, he said in a research note that he was hopeful that the aggressive and unconventional policy measures that have been taken by policy makers, including deep interest rate reductions and capital injections into banks, would help to “pave the way for a gradual recovery in the second half of next year.”
A separate statement on Friday showed that the economic malaise is touching automakers particularly hard.
Looking ahead, he said, the overall picture looks discouraging, “as clearly suggested by plunging business surveys in October,” adding that ”manufacturing activity is in a free fall due to an inventory overhang and plunging orders.”
Much of the decline could be traced to a 14 percent drop in the price of gasoline, but the cost of other goods — including clothes, milk and vegetables — also fell sharply.
“Whatever I thought that risk was, four or five months ago, I think it is bigger now even if it is still small,” Mr. Kohn said in response to a question after a speech.
The Fed, he added, would be aggressive, if necessary, to prevent a broad drop in prices.
Stocks started falling shortly after 10 a.m. and ground their way down for much of the day before tumbling sharply in the last hour of trading.
The index is now only 37 points above its October 2002 low.
Financial shares led the market down, with Citigroup falling by more than 23 percent and Bank of America closing down 14 percent.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 3.32 percent, from 3.53 on Tuesday.
Analysts say a sustained decline in consumer prices would be terrible for the economy.
Businesses that cut prices to attract buyers are likely to have to lay off workers as well.
They may also have little left over to pay lenders or shareholders.
Prices are falling outside the United States too.
The decline in consumer prices is all the more remarkable because this summer many economists were concerned about inflation and the prospect for stagflation, in which inflation and unemployment rise simultaneously, contrary to their usual relationship.
It’s over.”
But that concern has been quickly dashed, in large part because of a steep drop in commodity prices.
Crude oil prices, for instance, have fallen more than 63 percent from their July peak of $145.29 a barrel, to $53.62 on Wednesday.
The national average price for unleaded gasoline is now $2.05 a gallon, down from $2.92 a month earlier, according to AAA, the auto club.

For instance, room rates at luxury hotels fell 5.4 percent in the 28 days ending on Nov. 15 — in contrast to a 1.3 percent increase in rates at midscale hotels that do not serve food, estimated Smith Travel Research, a firm that studies the industry.
Over all, hotel prices fell 1.6 percent in October, according to the Labor Department.
High-end retailers are resorting to drastic discounting to lure customers into stores.
Airfares, which were rising along with energy prices this summer, are now sliding as airlines struggle to fill seats on many popular routes.
The average price of a one-way ticket is down about 20 percent from July, to $107 in mid-November, according to Harrell Associates, a firm that tracks the airline industry.
The prices of goods and services like meat, alcohol, medical care and education increased in October.

“It would take significant and persistent contraction in the economy to push core inflation into negative territory,” said Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York.
“We do not think that is likely, especially given the aggressive policy response on the part of the Fed and Treasury.”
The Fed has already cut its benchmark interest rate to 1 percent from 5.25 percent last year, and it has been lending hundreds of billions of dollars to banks and corporations in recent months to revive credit markets.
The Treasury has also pumped nearly $300 billion into banks and other financial firms.
The Fed is anticipating significant further slowing in the economy.
A report released on Wednesday shows that the Fed now expects 2009 growth to be 1.8 percent to minus 1 percent, down from a previous forecast of growth of 1.9 percent to 3 percent.

Even though the Fed’s target interest rate is close to zero, economists say there is much more the central bank and the government can do to revive the economy.
“The Fed is going to ram liquidity into the financial system whether it is asking for it or not, just going out and buying assets and printing money in order to do it,” said Alan D. Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price.
“If you jam money into everyone’s pocket, they will spend it.”
Furthermore, lawmakers in Washington are also expected to pass a significant fiscal stimulus package in January after the new administration and Congress take power.
Policy makers could head off deflation by spending hundreds of billions of dollars on tax breaks, infrastructure projects and other initiatives.
British regulators rejected a plan on Friday to add locally focused video news to BBC Web sites in Britain, dealing a setback to the digital ambitions of the BBC, which has expanded aggressively on the Internet.
The BBC Trust, which oversees the public broadcaster, and Ofcom, the British media regulator, said the proposal would have hurt rivals in the private sector, including the Web sites of newspapers.
Under the plan, the BBC wanted to spend £68 million, or $100 million, and hire 400 people to provide news, sports and weather for dozens of local BBC Web sites.
The decision on Friday was “the first major example of the trust showing its muscles,” Roy Greenslade, a British media commentator, said in a blog entry on the Web site of the newspaper The Guardian.
“In that sense, it is a landmark moment in broadcasting history.”
The move drew interest across Europe because regulators in several countries, including Germany, are scrutinizing public broadcasters’ digital plans.
The European Commission, in a proposal published this month, suggests that governments impose stricter conditions on financing for public broadcasters.

“In as far as commercial broadcasters, and indeed publishers and other media owners, were looking for greater certainty that this kind of scrutiny can work, this is a very positive step,” Ross Biggam, the director general of ACT, a lobbying group for commercial broadcasters that is based in Brussels, said of the British decision.
They would have also been discouraged from starting new services on the Web, the regulator said.
Underlining the challenges facing British newspapers, Enders Analysis, a research firm, said Friday that their advertising revenue would fall 21 percent next year.
Newspapers have been hit particularly hard because of the migration of classified advertising to the Internet.

“Now local publishers can innovate in this area without the fear of getting squashed by a giant elephant.”
The BBC Trust urged the BBC to focus on improving the quality of existing news services aimed at local audiences in Britain, including television and radio broadcasts.
It focused on a radio program in October in which Jonathan Ross, the BBC’s highest paid performer, and a fellow comedian, Russell Brand, left lewd messages on an aging actor’s telephone answering machine.
Mr.
Mr.
Automakers have reported falling sales numbers for months, with the annualized sales rate for October the worst in 25 years, according to data compiled by a trade journal, Ward’s Automotive Reports.
Automakers are on pace to sell fewer than 11 million vehicles in 2008, about a third fewer than the annual average of the last decade.
Although 2009 models are in showrooms, last year’s vehicles remain on dealership lots, and unusually high inventory-financing costs are giving dealers more reason to clear out the surplus by offering sweet deals.

“It’s a buyer’s market right now,” said Adam J. Renie, sales manager at Gray Auto, an independent used-car dealership in Greenfield, Ind.
“Anybody who is an able buyer, you are making sure they end up in your vehicle.”
So how should you go about making your purchasing decision?
Should you lease or own?
And what should you do about your old vehicle?
Here are some things to consider before buying a vehicle in the current environment:
EXPLORE YOUR FINANCING OPTIONS The contrast between the most credit-worthy borrowers and those with black marks has never been so great.
“If you have very good credit as a customer, you can expect a smooth approval process as well as attractive rates,” said Jesse Toprak, chief industry analyst for Edmunds.com.
“If you are classified as a subprime borrower, things are going to be a lot more challenging.” In fact, some lenders like GMAC are now making car loans only to borrowers with high credit scores.
But what can you expect if you fall somewhere in between?
The truth is, ordinary borrowers are still able to obtain financing.
The terms are just more stringent than they used to be.
Lenders are now demanding that weaker borrowers come up with a 10 to 15 percent down payment, whereas only six months ago lenders were happy to provide financing without any cash up front.
They are also requesting more information to verify applicants’ income.
And lenders have started raising interest rates, to a range of 7 to 15 percent depending on a buyer’s credit history.
The result is that a customer with weak credit will pay about $7,100 more in interest for a $28,000 five-year loan than a borrower with pristine credit, according to an Edmunds.com analysis.
That makes it important to shop for the car loan before you look for the car.
Start by going to an online lender, like Capital One Financial or E-Loan.
It will take your application, offer an interest rate, approve you for a specific dollar amount and mail you a bank check the next day.
Or head to your local bank or credit union to check its offers.
The car dealership should be your last stop for a loan.
Typically, dealers offer loans from the financing arm of the car’s manufacturer, and then mark the rate up for a profit.

That usually makes dealer financing the most expensive option, if you even qualify.
But there is one big exception: to sell more cars, sometimes the manufacturer subsidizes the financing so that the dealer can offer a lower rate.
Infiniti, Nissan and Toyota are among automakers offering zero-percent financing on selected models — for customers with good credit histories.
New deals seem to turn up each week.
Still, that only reinforces why it is important to check out the interest rates elsewhere.
No longer.
Leasing, which until recently accounted for a fifth of the new vehicle market, is no longer as attractive for consumers.
Leases may not even be available for many trucks and S.U.V.’s.
Ford, GMAC and several major banks have scaled back leasing operations.
Some European and Japanese automakers are still offering leases, especially for luxury vehicles.
Even so, the monthly payments are likely to be higher than in the past.
Keeping your monthly payment low is a two-step process.
First, negotiate the lowest possible purchase price as if you were buying the car for cash.
Then, shop around for the highest possible residual price, which is the vehicle’s projected value when you turn it back in.
In a lease deal, the vehicle is owned by a bank or finance company, and you effectively rent it, typically for two or three years.
Selling the vehicle at lease-end becomes the leasing company’s responsibility, so the higher the residual value, the better your lease deal is likely to be.
Different leasing companies may set different residual values.
Of course, the economics of leasing are no longer as favorable as they once were.
One reason is that residual values have plunged, especially as gas-guzzlers have flooded the used-car market.
For example, the residual value for the average S.U.V.
is about 10 percent lower than last year, according to the Automotive Lease Guide.
For a full-size S.U.V.
with a $42,000 sticker price, that would cause monthly lease payments to rise about $150 a month, all else being equal.

On top of that, automakers are no longer inflating residual values or subsidizing finance charges.
That makes leasing even costlier.
BEWARE OF LONGER LOANS To keep monthly payments lower, car companies are pushing longer loans, sometimes for six years or more.
If you plan to keep a car that long, the longer payback schedule may not matter much.
But for anyone who plans to get a new vehicle in two or three years, longer loans are not a good deal.
Here’s why: if you are spreading payments over eight years, but the vehicle is going to depreciate greatly over five years, you still have to make another three years of payments.
“To get out of that deal, the consumer is looking at a situation where they will have to go into their pocket to pay off that loan,” said John Blair, chief executive of the Automotive Lease Guide.
“That is the potential risk.”
LOOK BEFORE YOU TRADE-IN Call it reverse sticker-shock.
Buyers have long braced themselves for high prices on their dream cars.
But many are even more surprised by how little their vehicles are worth when they sell them.
Prices for the biggest S.U.V.’s and pickup trucks are down more than 23 percent from October 2007, according to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index.
Other categories have been similarly hard hit.
On average, prices of used vans have fallen 15.9 percent, used sports cars by 6.1 percent and luxury cars by 8.7 percent.
Because selling your car now may be like selling stock at the bottom of the market, it may be prudent to keep it.

To get a sense of what your car is worth, you can consult the Kelley Blue Book or its online edition at KBB.com.
But there is no substitute for testing the market yourself.
On the flip side, those ending a lease may have unknowingly hit a jackpot.
You may be able to negotiate a lower price to buy the car outright instead of turning it back in.
KNOW WHEN TO WALK Buying a car can be stressful.
In part, that’s because it really means negotiating two deals — and possibly three.
Savvy buyers will negotiate the purchase price of their car first, then haggle over the terms of the financing.
Finally, they negotiate the value of a trade-in separately.
If the dealer refuses to discount the car unless you use the company’s financing, that’s your cue to leave.
The cascade of ideas begins with the rejection of the widely accepted notion that the United States has often been an isolationist power.

Right from the start, Mr.
Herring says, the generation of founding fathers was outward looking and consumed by diplomacy.
What is more, expansionism, first beyond the original 13 colonies, then into the Caribbean and Pacific and eventually culminating in a political and economic domain spanning the world, has almost always animated American leaders.
Already at the time of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, in 1787, no less than James Madison spoke of “laying the foundation of a great empire.” By 1821 John Quincy Adams was mocking the fast swelling British Empire: “I do not know what you claim nor what you do not claim.” When his British interlocutor replied sarcastically, “Perhaps, a piece of the moon,” Adams issued a blunt warning about North America: “Keep what is yours and leave the rest of the continent to us.”
Less than a decade later President Andrew Jackson had embraced gunboat diplomacy to East Asia and exploration of the South Pole, and spoke of showing the flag “to every portion of the globe, to give to civilized and savage man a just impression of the power we possess.”
Attitudes like this were steadily fed by a fast-growing population, an economy that became the envy of the world and by a creed of American exceptionalism, whose roots could already be discerned in the words of Thomas Jefferson.
Herring notes, one-fifth of the American population were slaves.
Photo
Less conventionally, in terms of the mainstream way history has been taught for generations, Mr.
Herring paints a potent picture of the role of race as an important and frequently central motive behind American actions.
This story line begins with the annihilation of American Indians, who conducted lively foreign relations of their own, with the government in Washington, with the European powers and even with the Confederacy until its subjugation.
His story continues with the politics of black bondage, as the young nation pushed west, extending the frontier of slavery and precipitating the Civil War.

The narrative of frank racism, a word Mr.
Herring employs frequently, gains momentum in a discussion of Manifest Destiny, which he says had more to do with an ideology of racial superiority than with altruism.
The examples, in 19th-century dealings with continental neighbors like Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua, are as painful as they are numerous.
“Americans scorned Mexicans as a mixed breed, even below free blacks and Indians, ‘an imbecile and pusillanimous race,’ ” Mr.
Herring writes.
He adds a few pages later, “The very racism that drove the United States into Mexico limited its conquests.”
Quoting Andrew Jackson Donelson, the former president’s nephew, Mr.
Herring recounts, “We can no more amalgamate with her people than with negroes.” Much later, we learn, the same thinking prevented Puerto Rico from becoming a state.
When he gets to the 20th century, Mr.
Herring labors to portray Woodrow Wilson as the figure who “towers above the landscape of modern American foreign policy.” But in Mr. Herring’s telling it is Franklin D. Roosevelt who leaves the biggest impression, despite his frequent criticisms of Roosevelt’s maddening management style.
Wilson and Roosevelt began their presidencies by minimizing foreign policy.
Wilson spent six months in Paris pursuing a peaceful new world order.
Trends of the past carry steadily forward throughout the book, with idealism, self-regard and seemingly ever-increasing power combining with condescension and arrogance, particularly toward non-Western peoples, causing the United States to underestimate others and overplay its hand, perhaps most notably in Korea and Vietnam.
Mr.
Herring concludes by advising Americans to prepare for their relative decline: “They must cast away centuries-old notions of themselves as God’s chosen people.
In today’s world, such pretensions cannot fail to alienate others.”
LONDON — In emotional and blunt terms, Barclays shareholders showed their displeasure with the British bank’s fund-raising on Monday even as they seemed resigned to approving the plan.
Angry shareholders lashed out at directors over the bank’s plan to raise $10.5 billion — mostly from Middle Eastern investors — and dilute existing shareholders.
“The need for speed and certainty overrode our desire to do right by our shareholders,” Mr. Agius said.
Vocal protests notwithstanding, the grudging approval of shareholders was a significant victory for Barclays’ bold gambit of forgoing government aid in market conditions that seem to be worsening by the week.

That deal would have required Barclays to cede a stake to the government.
The bank, he said, could get a higher return on investment without government assistance.
But he would not address payouts to other senior bankers, in particular Roger Jenkins, a middleman in the fund-raising who also runs Barclays’ hugely profitable tax arbitrage unit.
Barclays pledged to align the bank’s remuneration policy with shareholder interests.
The board has “complete confidence in our management team,” Mr. Agius said.
One shareholder called the fund-raising “morally indefensible,” and another referred to the Middle Eastern investors as a “Trojan horse.”
Another investor called the deal “a game of Russian roulette with all the chambers loaded.”
But beneath the uproar was resigned acceptance from most investors, who seemed to find the terms and conduct unpalatable but the consequence of voting the deal down even more dire.

But analysts said the program would do little to reduce the tidal wave of foreclosures.
That is because most of the foreclosures are on subprime mortgages and other high-risk loans that were not bought or guaranteed by government-sponsored finance companies like Fannie Mae.
The long-term risks are enormous but difficult to estimate.
They begin with the danger of a new surge of inflation, at least after the economy comes out of its current downturn.
Beyond that, taxpayers will have to pick up the losses from loans that default or guarantees that have to be made good.
But the most troublesome unknowns are how the maze of protections for investors and consumers will change economic and political behavior in the future.
“The Federal Reserve has a lot of levers of influence with consequences for individual industries,” said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former Fed official and now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
“Now that it has used those levers, don’t you think Congress will want it to start using them again?
The Fed could become the go-to place for bailouts.”
Administration and central bank officials contend that the risk of doing nothing is a full-blown depression in which unemployment climbs above 10 percent and the country needs years to recover.
Many private economists agree.

“They are doing whatever it takes,” said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm.
“The problem is, the more you go in this direction, the harder it is to turn around and the harder your exit strategy is.”
Most economists agree that the United States is in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and that it has already fallen into a severe recession that is likely to be one of the deepest in decades.

“What they are doing is trying to limit the damage to something consistent with a severe postwar recession, but not something worse than that,” Mr. Meyer said.
But private forecasters predict that economic activity will fall by 4 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter and continue to contract for much of next year.
In the first of two new actions announced on Tuesday, the Treasury and the Fed said they would create a $200 billion program to lend money against securities backed by car loans, student loans, credit card debt and even small-business loans.
The Treasury would contribute $20 billion to the so-called Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility and assume responsibility for any losses up to $20 billion.
The Federal Reserve would lend the new entity as much as $180 billion.
The new facility would then lend money at low rates to companies that post collateral based on securities backed by consumer debt or business loans.
The new program would be allowed to accept only securities with Triple-A ratings, the highest possible, from at least two rating agencies.

“It’s going to take awhile to get this program up and going, and then it could be expanded and increased over time,” he said at a news conference.
Separately, the central bank announced that it would try to force down home mortgage rates by buying up $600 billion in debt tied to home loans guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other government-controlled financing companies.
It was the first time that the Fed and the Treasury have stepped in to finance consumer debt.
The $200 billion program comes close to being a government bank.
Instead of trying to strengthen the economy by reducing short-term rates, which is the usual policy tool, the Fed is now pumping vast amounts of money directly into specific markets for mortgages — and anything else it believes needs help.

Over the last year, the Fed and the Treasury have bailed out major Wall Street firms, rescued the world’s biggest insurer, taken over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and guaranteed hundreds of billions of dollars in bank transactions.
As big as the two new lending programs are, Mr. Meyer cautioned that they were only going to reduce the pain that lies ahead, not eliminate it.
Unemployment, at 6.5 percent in October, is still likely to climb to 7.5 or even 8 percent next year, he predicted.
But it may not shoot up to 9 or 10 percent, a level that economists often consider the unofficial dividing line between a recession and a depression.
The new actions are unlikely to be the last.
Until the economy begins to turn around, Fed officials have made it clear they are prepared to print as much money as needed to jump-start lending, consumer spending, home buying and investment.
“They are using every tool at their disposal, and they will move from credit market to credit market to reduce disruptions,” said Richard Berner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.
The Federal Reserve has now moved to a radical new phase of its effort to shore up the economy.
Until now, it has carefully distinguished between two goals — reducing the panic and turmoil in financial markets, and propping up the economy itself, which has been battered as the supply of credit has dried up.
To bolster the general economy, it relied on its traditional tool: reducing the overnight Federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks charge for lending their reserves to one another.
Normally, a lower Federal funds rates leads to lower long-term rates, like those for mortgages.

But the central bank has already lowered the rate to 1 percent, and it cannot reduce it below zero.
Instead, policy makers are buying up other kinds of debt securities, which has the effect of driving down the rates in those parts of the market.
The move amounts to what economists refer to as “quantitative easing,” which means having the Fed pump staggering amounts of money into the economy by buying up a wide range of debt instruments.
But for practical purposes, the actions lead to similar results.
Investors seem to have regained a bit of confidence since the government threw another multibillion-dollar lifeline to Citigroup on Sunday night, easing fears of an October-style decline in the markets.
Soothing words from a host of federal officials, including President-elect Barack Obama, who held a news conference on the economy every day this week, also helped calm the markets.
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama announced that Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chief, would lead a new economic advisory committee for the White House.

Some Wall Street traders worry that the market could falter again as the economic slump deepens.
Nevertheless, good news of any sort is welcome on Wall Street these days, and there were a few encouraging signs that maybe, this time, the strength would stick.
The optimistic mood survived an early challenge from a series of bleak economic reports, including the biggest monthly downturn in consumer spending since the terrorist attacks of 2001.
Shares of General Motors gained 35 percent, or $1.25, to $4.81, on speculation that the automaker might receive a rescue package from the government.
The markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving Day, and will reopen for a shortened session on Friday.

The energy sector was the leading gainer among industry groups, following the surge in crude oil prices.
Analysts said a move by the Chinese government to cut interest rates could stimulate the country’s economy and revive demand for energy.
OPEC ministers are set to meet over the weekend to discuss measures to support oil prices.
The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.98 percent, down from 3.11 percent Tuesday.
Seabase is little known in the diving world, but Patric Douglas, a shark expert, guide and commercial diver in San Francisco, sees it as a pioneer in a movement to create artificial environments where divers can swim with big fish that are increasingly rare in the wild.
Resorts, casinos and public aquariums have begun investigating Seabase-like facilities, he said.

For now, divers like Todd Gardner, 38, of Riverhead, N.Y., travel to Bonneville Seabase to swim with tropical species from around the world in an environment that can be fully explored in a couple of hours.
“You forget where you are,” said Mr. Gardner, who works at Atlantis Marine World in Riverhead.
He described feeding tropical fish out of his hand at Seabase and then surfacing to winter weather.
A former chemist, Ms. Nelson came up with the concept of stocking desert springs with ocean fish in the 1980s.
After analyzing salinity levels, she and Mr. Sanders bought 60 acres from the town of Grantsville, including three warm-spring basins that receive water naturally from the ancient salt beds of prehistoric Lake Bonneville, which once covered the region.
“Our water doesn’t have enough magnesium or sulfate compared to the ocean, and the pH is too low, but the fish are doing fine,” Ms. Nelson said.
Living in the Seabase waters are snappers, several kinds of angelfish and butterflyfish, silver scats, mono argentus and more.
During the morning feeding, I watched aggressive Crevalle jacks swoop up to nab bits of chopped fish, whipping their tails and then disappearing back into the depths.
But the sharks — two males adopted 10 years ago after outgrowing residential aquariums — never surfaced.

Coaxing aquatic life in an ersatz ocean didn’t come easy for Ms. Nelson and Mr. Sanders, world-traveling divers and self-taught ichthyologists.
Coral couldn’t grow in the salty springs.
Algae blooms, a constant problem, spread uncontrollably in the warm geothermic water, which is 90 degrees at the bottom but is cooled by the air at the surface.
Last winter, a stock of 10,000 shrimp were introduced to Habitat Bay, a half-acre pool that’s 24 feet deep.
A flock of hundreds of ducks living in wetlands south of the Great Salt Lake soon discovered them.
“They ate them all,” Ms. Nelson said.
But after years of experimentation, an equilibrium has been accomplished at Seabase, which keeps three pools open for diving, including the Abyss, a 62-foot-deep hole that required thousands of hours of work with industrial cranes to dredge out in the desert.
Of the dozens of species introduced, a handful have adapted to this high-altitude home, growing, reproducing and living for years in an ocean ecosystem 600 miles from the Pacific Coast.
“You used to be able to zip to the Florida Keys and see pristine reefs and stunning sea life, but it’s no longer that easy.”
Local residents make up most of Seabase’s 1,500 to 2,000 annual visitors, including regulars from area dive clubs and people seeking scuba certification before trips to Cozumel or the Caribbean.
Masks, air tanks, fins and wet suits are for rent in the main building.
Divers top off their tanks at a refilling station on a sidewalk next to the communal shower room.
“This is a better idea than the breakfast buffet.”
Mr. Westover took a head of romaine lettuce with him underwater.
A pickup truck roared by a mile away on a country road.

Seabase — a mishmash of sheds, trailer homes, Quonset huts, construction equipment, camper trailers, ponds with polycarbonate covers, two telescope observatories and an airplane hangar — looked like a settlement on Mars.

The hermit used dynamite to clear a road and now keeps large-caliber guns on the hill.
“He’s an enterprising young fellow,” Mr. Sanders said.
Lew Ershler, who runs a powered-parachute flight program out of the airplane hangar on the site, mentioned a polygamist settlement in the hills across State Highway 138.
At 10 a.m.
Bits of squid still floated on the surface, uneaten ringlets from the morning feed.
“Swim with me out to the white pole,” Ms. Fox said, turning to glide away.
The pool, called White Rocks Bay, was capped under a polycarbonate roof to retain warmth in the wintertime (the outside gets down to freezing temperatures), creating a claustrophobic cave.
“Keep close,” Ms. Fox said.
“I’ll have a hand on you.”
She pressed a button on her buoyancy compensator, air wheezing out of the flotation lung.
Small fish swam by, amorphous little blips.

Unknowingly, I’d hovered a few inches over a shark’s back while scanning the bottom and following an angelfish.
The shark was resting in the rocks, its blood sluggish in the 68-degree water.
Back in the depths, swimming gingerly to keep the dust storm down, I followed my guide to find our cartilaginous friend.
Ms. Fox again tugged at my arm, signaling toward an underwater ledge.
I evened my breathing, the bubbles slowing down, and a spike appeared in focus, a triangle fin contrasting with the brown water.
The creature was dead still, seemingly asleep — a nine-foot-long fish fading away in algae and sediment, its head unseen.
Visibility is the Achilles’ heel at Seabase.
Desert storms, wind, blooming algae and thousands of stirring fish make a mix that some days resembles pea soup.
On my dive, visibility was about four and a half feet; the best days, according to Ms. Nelson, let sunlight cut 20 feet through the water.
“What do you think of this place?” Ms. Fox asked, smiling, as I stood dripping on concrete.
The water stirred below me, a school of minnows pecking bits.
Outside, a group of Seabase regulars were grilling hot dogs.
Charcoal smoke seeped up to where I was standing, a smell of ash mixing with musty aquarium air.
The fish were stirring in their desert home.
The sharks were quiet, still sleeping in the deep.

Seabase has showers, changing rooms, a snack bar, indoor tables for dining and camper trailers ($18 a night for two).
At the same site, Bonneville Skybase (801-557-5657; www.bonnevilleskybase.com) offers powered-parachute flights starting at $75 for 20 minutes.
A pilot and a passenger fly up to 1,000 feet for views of the dive ponds and the Great Salt Lake.
Private schools across New York City say they are thriving this fall, with record numbers of applicants and no significant decline in donations.
Yet almost daily, even brand-name schools are finding that they have to reassure jittery parents about shrinking endowments and dispel rumors that requests for financial aid are pouring in, and that economically squeezed families are pulling their children out and enrolling them in public schools.
The school is not yet releasing admission numbers for next year’s class, but Ms. Scull wrote, “This year’s admissions season has been perhaps busier than usual, and to date we have had no reports of families planning to leave us.”
But the shrinking economy is taking a toll on investment returns at Trinity, whose endowment has fallen to $40 million from $50 million in July, and at other private schools, affecting what they can spend on programs and activities.
“If it happens at Harvard, it will happen to everybody.”
Many private schools say they are budgeting conservatively for next year and taking steps to offset any lost revenue from investments and the possibility of donor fatigue.
In a letter released on Nov. 17, Dalton’s head of school, Ellen C. Stein, and Robert Kasdin, president of the board, wrote that while the school remained in “a position of strength,” mostly because it has no mortgages or other debt and fund-raising remains strong, it is “targeting efficiencies where possible” and “reviewing all capital expenditures.”
Dalton’s Web site refers to a $58 million endowment, but attaches no date to that figure.
School officials will say only that its investment funds are down less than the market this year.
Public records show that Dalton was heavily invested in hedge funds as of June 30, 2007, the most recent date available, with about half of its financial assets in six funds.
That roster includes several funds that have gotten stung in recent months, like TPG-Axon and Greenlight Capital Offshore.

Just south of Union Square, the Grace Church School, which has a $17 million endowment, expects to draw about $400,000 from those funds next year — a drop of about $100,000 — to support school activities.
George P. Davison, the head of school, said he hopes to make up the shortfall in part by postponing the purchase of computers and desks, by patching a school roof instead of replacing it, and by lowering energy bills.
His school has also had to cope with fluctuating interest rates on $20 million it borrowed two years ago to improve its campus.
Every Wednesday, the rate — and what his school must pay — resets depending on the vagaries of the London Interbank Offered Rate.
Now it’s 3.3 percent.”
Even with less money coming in and costs uncertain, several leading schools say they want to increase financial aid to students.
Mark Stanek, head of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, which gave out $8.1 million in financial aid this year, wrote to parents on Nov. 14 that the school was “hoping to maintain, and if possible, expand this budget over the next few years.”

Since then, a handful of families have come forward to request aid from the school, which has campuses on Central Park West and in the Bronx.
Columbia Grammar and Preparatory, whose $25 million endowment is invested in United States Treasury securities, also plans to expand its financial aid by about $500,000 next year, to nearly $5 million.
Richard J. Soghoian, headmaster of the Upper West Side school, sent out a letter last month reaffirming that the school was moving ahead with a $2 million renovation of a brownstone to create art and music classes.
“The letter was very well timed.”
As much as schools want to extend aid to keep hard-hit families in the fold, they say the policy might have to be revisited if markets continue to falter and take jobs with them.
Mr. Davison, who also heads the Guild of Independent Schools in New York, warned: “It’s Wall Street that worries us in New York City.
If all these financial jobs move to London, we’re in trouble.”
Robert J. Samuelson is a conservative from a time when conservatism was more a sensibility than an ideology.
His business columns in The Washington Post and Newsweek preach old-fashioned virtue on a macroeconomic scale: don’t promise more than you can deliver; weigh the unintended consequences of your actions; beware hucksters bearing easy fixes.
Samuelson often directs this advice to government officials ­— his nominal subjects are budget shortfalls, interest rates and energy prices.
But his rules are every bit as relevant to daily life as they are to public policy.
It is therefore no surprise that Samuel­son would write a book-length meditation on inflation — that ultimate symbol of cultural rot masquerading as an economic problem.
Inflation-racked countries scorn all the self-abnegating rituals that make capitalism work.
They want their guns and their butter and they want them now.
So they print money to pay for them.
By contrast, low-inflation countries are committed to an ethos of scrimping and toiling that yields long-term rewards.
In “The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath,” Samuel­son studies the transformation of the United States from the first kind of country to the second.
The villain in Samuelson’s morality tale is a group of intellectuals who came into fashion during World War II, then came into power with the Kennedy administration.
“Heller was an aggressive salesman for what ultimately became known as the ‘new economics,’ ” Samuelson writes, but he was “hardly a one-man band.” Many of the day’s leading economic lights — James Tobin of Yale and Robert Solow and Paul Samuelson (no relation to Robert), both of M.I.T.
The idea was that an economy could experience very low unemployment and high inflation, or very high unemployment and low inflation, or any combination therein.
Heller persuaded Kennedy to move leftward along this spectrum by stimulating the economy — effectively accepting higher inflation in exchange for more jobs.

It worked for a time.
It was clear that, over the long term, the government could no more trade “a little inflation” for sustained growth than a drug addict could use “a little heroin” for a sustained high.
Achieving the same economic payoff required ever more stimulus.
Some presidents struggled to control their addictions, while others didn’t even try.
“Nixon frequently reminded Burns,” Samuelson writes, referring to Arthur Burns, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, “that the president’s political fortunes depended heavily on the Fed’s ability to increase economic growth.”
Achieving such a swing would mean adding nearly $1 trillion in annual output to the economy.
The private sector normally does this, stepping up its spending as a recovery takes hold.
But if that does not happen this time, the Obama administration would have to step in, via a stimulus package that generated the additional $1 trillion in output, most likely through a mix of federal spending and tax breaks.

No policy maker or economist has publicly suggested such a huge sum.
Trillions of dollars is a commonplace reference in talking about the financial bailout, but not yet the stimulus.
The debate instead revolves around the proper mix for a stimulus package — that is, the most effective combination of outright spending and lower taxes.
Prominent economists argue that more than 50 percent of the next package, whatever its size, should be devoted to spending — on public infrastructure like highway and school repair, and on items like food stamps and stepped-up aid to state governments, subsidizing their spending.
Repairing a road, for example, means hiring workers who spend their new salaries at supermarkets, which in turn hire more store clerks and stock more groceries to handle the extra spending.
This “multiplier effect” is missing, however, when the stimulus comes as a tax break.
A $750 billion stimulus package devoted entirely to spending could achieve, through the multiplier effect, more than the $1 trillion rise in output that the Obama administration apparently seeks to generate the 2.5 million new jobs.
A stimulus devoted entirely to tax breaks, in contrast, would require the entire $1 trillion in rebates or lower taxes, and probably more, to create those jobs, in part because taxpayers getting this windfall might not spend all of it.
Spending on domestically produced goods and services adds to the nation’s economic output, but imports do not, helping to explain why this first stimulus failed to arrest the contraction.

The problem with a stimulus package weighted heavily toward public spending is that there is a shortage of projects on which spending could begin in two or three months.
The labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, for example, has listed $65 billion in ready-to-go work, a third of it highway and school repair.
Mr. Zandi offers a similar estimate.

“Still,” he said, “if you don’t pick a big enough number for a stimulus package now and you have to announce another number next year, people will say: ‘Oh, the stimulus didn’t work.
What makes you think this one will?’ ”
Until now, big numbers have been noticeably absent from the stimulus debate.
The House approved a $60 billion package in late September, sending it to the Senate, which has not voted on the measure.
The House action was followed in mid-October by talk among Democratic Congressional leaders of upgrading the $60 billion to as much as $200 billion in a lame duck session.
And then a week ago, Senator Charles E. Schumer, the senior Democrat from New York, suggested that any package should be $500 billion to $700 billion — numbers that begin to approach the $1.4 trillion already spent to resurrect the financial system.
“By our estimates,” Jan Hatzius, chief domestic economist for Goldman Sachs, said in a newsletter last week, “the private sector retrenchment could subtract an annualized 4 percentage points or about $600 billion from economic growth through the end of 2009.”
The financial sector bailout does not address this decline.
Rescuing banks and other lenders has little direct impact on economic growth or job creation.
The chief goal of the bailout is to get credit flowing again from reluctant and damaged lenders.
The stimulus package, in contrast, puts up government money as a substitute for the spending and investment that is no longer taking place in the private sector — despite low interest rates — so that the economy can grow again, or at least stop shrinking.
That makes the stimulus package ever more important if the economy continues to deteriorate at its present pace.
Not since the first quarter of 1982, in the midst of a severe recession, has the gross domestic product contracted at a 4 percent annual rate in a single three-month period, as a growing number of forecasters say it is now doing, according to Blue Chip Economic Indicators.
In America’s $14.4 trillion economy, that means the output of goods and services has been declining by nearly $50 billion a month since September — a decline the government will find itself under ever more pressure to reverse if demand in the private sector does not revive.
As if adding a grim punctuation mark to what could become the worst holiday shopping season in decades, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged nearly 680 points, or 7.7 percent, to 8,149.09.

Part of the drop may have reflected profit-taking after last week’s surge in stock prices, but it also came in response to new data showing that manufacturing activity dropped to its lowest point in 26 years.
Among the options, he said, the Fed can start aggressively buying up longer-term Treasury securities.
That would have the effect of driving down longer-term interest rates.
The Fed is already doing something of that sort, by buying up commercial debt from private companies as well as mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Investors reacted to Mr. Bernanke’s remarks by pouring money into longer-term Treasury bonds, which briefly pushed already-low yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasuries to new record lows.
Investors appeared to be reacting mainly to the clear signal from Mr. Bernanke that the Fed was preparing to pump money into the economy by buying up longer-term bonds.
In normal times, those kinds of yields would automatically mean lower interest rates on mortgages, automobile loans and other forms of consumer debt.
But the credit markets have been stalled by continued fears among financial institutions about who can be trusted for even short-term transactions, so the effects on home loans and other purposes could remain modest.

In Congress, Democratic leaders are drawing up a huge new fiscal stimulus plan that could total more than $500 billion.
Meanwhile, Democrats could take up legislation next week that would provide financial assistance to the automobile industry.

“I’m sorry it’s happening, of course,” Mr. Bush said in an interview with ABC’s “World News” on Monday.
“Obviously, I don’t like the idea of Americans losing their jobs or being worried about their 401(k)s. On the other hand, the American people got to know that we will safeguard the system.”
But many analysts said they saw no signs yet that the economy was nearing a bottom.
American consumers, who for decades have been the country’s tireless source of growth when all else failed, have cut back on their spending more sharply than at any time since the early 1980s.
Consumer spending plunged in the third quarter of this year, and the evidence so far suggests they may pull back even more in the fourth quarter.
Consumers account for about 71 percent of American economic activity, and their most recent retreat is occurring even though gasoline prices have dropped by almost half in the last month and left people with more money in their pockets.
In explaining its decision, the bureau noted that a wide variety of other indicators, including payroll employment and personal income, peaked in December 2007.
Payroll employment has dropped every month since then.
The announcement means that the downturn is already one year old.
That is longer than the average length of 10.5 months for recessions since World War II.
The current record for the longest recession over the last half-century is 16 months, which was reached in both the downturns of 1973-74 and 1980-81.
Mr. Sinai of Decision Economics said it was hard to imagine that this downturn would have hit bottom within the next four months, which would make it all but certain to set a new record.
“We are actively engaged in developing additional programs to strengthen our financial system so that lending flows to our economy,” Mr. Paulson said in his speech.
“We are continuing to examine potential foreclosure mitigation ideas that may be an appropriate” use of the funds.
Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticized Mr. Paulson for refusing to use any of the money yet for reducing foreclosures.
Cleaning crews scrubbed Suvarnabhumi International Airport, the sprawling $4 billion tourist gateway and regional hub, as protesters filed out of the main terminal, taking souvenir photographs and stopping to ask their leaders for autographs.
Airline reservation offices were swamped with calls, and it is likely to be several days before all the stranded foreign visitors — estimated to number 230,000 — are able to leave.
The problem is the continuing legacy of Thaksin Shinawatra, the fugitive former prime minister who remains a powerful force among the just-banned party.
But the protesters, largely drawn from the elite and middle-class establishment, seek a definitive end to Mr. Thaksin’s network of influence, which has dogged charges of corruption and nepotism.
At the same time, the protesters feel threatened by the Thaksin faction’s empowerment of the rural poor, and want to dilute the hinterland’s growing electoral power.

The People’s Alliance for Democracy, the group that led the demonstrations, vowed to resume its street protests if “a proxy government of the Thaksin regime is set up again.”
“From now on, if there is any government which comes into power but is insincere in its efforts to launch new politics with the people, the P.A.D.
will return,” the group said in a statement.
It also highlighted the fragility of Thailand’s political system, which has been locked in a stalemate between Mr. Thaksin’s detractors and supporters for the past three years.
Meanwhile, attention was shifting to the country’s revered monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who traditionally gives a state-of-the-nation-style address on the eve of his Dec. 5 birthday.
HONG KONG — New Zealand’s central bank cut its interest rates on Thursday, joining policy makers around the world seeking to lower the cost of borrowing to bolster their slowing economies.
The key rate has been lowered by a total of three and a half percentage points since then, a clear indication of the depth of concern in New Zealand — and elsewhere — about the economic slowdown that has swept around the world.
“Activity in most of our trading partners is now expected to contract or grow only very slowly over the next few quarters,” he added, and “economic activity in New Zealand will be further constrained as a result.”
The announcement comes before widely expected deep cuts in rates in Britain and the euro zone later on Thursday.
Australia earlier this week lowered its key rate by a full percentage point — taking its combined cuts since September to 3 percentage points.
And China, which until recently enjoyed double-digit rates of growth, has also lowered rates aggressively in a bid to safeguard the 8 percent rate that is considered key to preserving jobs growth and social stability.

As a result, the European Central Bank is expected to lower its key rate by at least half a percentage point to 2.75 percent; many analysts have said the cut could be even deeper.
And the Bank of England, which last month shocked observers with a cut of one and a half percentage points, is expected by many to lower its rate by a whole percentage point to 2 percent.
HONG KONG — The chief executive of HSBC’s Asian operations called on Friday for Asian governments to abandon as soon as possible their guarantees of bank deposits, saying they amount to inappropriate assistance to weak banks at the risk of imposing a costly burden on taxpayers.
The surge of deposits transferred from weaker banks ended with the introduction of government guarantees, and HSBC returned to its usual level of accumulating deposits, Mr. Flockhart said, adding that government guarantees now cover 93 percent of bank deposits in Asia.
He called for an early end to deposit guarantees that are scheduled to remain in place here through 2010.
“We would hope that government support mechanism would be withdrawn as soon as expedient rather than wait to 2010,” he said.

Even if the Hong Kong government keeps universal deposit guarantees in place, it should charge weaker banks more for them, he said.
In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation already charges banks a fee for the guarantees on their deposits, with the fee calculated not only from the size of the deposits but also from the financial strength of the bank.
Banks with strong balance sheets pay smaller fees for every million dollars of deposits, as an incentive for banks to keep plenty of capital.
Many governments in Asia quickly expanded deposit insurance this autumn without trying to assess any fees.
“The government has said that the measure will be in force until the end of 2010, when a decision will be taken in the light of international financial conditions on whether it should be extended,” the monetary authority said.
“Separately, the H.K.M.A.
will continue to conduct broad-based consultation on the longer-term deposit protection arrangement after the end of 2010, and then make suggestions and propose relevant amendments to the law.”

David W. Lam, the managing director for clients in Asia and the Pacific for GAM, the big London-based asset management company, said in an interview on Thursday that there had been some shift this autumn of assets by wealthy Asian households to bank accounts in Hong Kong and Singapore to take advantage of these cities’ comprehensive bank guarantees by financially strong government bodies.
“Some of them, not all” are shifting money “to a certain extent,” although the extent of the move is hard to quantify, Mr. Lam said.
Although now based in London, HSBC has not sought financial assistance from either the British or American governments during the current turmoil in markets.

Mr. Flockhart said the bank, which has recently announced it was taking majority stakes in banks in India and Indonesia, would continue to remain on the lookout for other potential targets.
He said that the current turmoil in the financial world could present opportunities.
He added, however, that the cost of banking assets in emerging markets like Asia had not fallen as much as in, say, the United States, meaning they remained relatively expensive.
Currency and stock market volatility, as well as uncertainty about companies’ future earnings as the global economy slows, will make it hard next year to price assets in banking and other industries, he said.
Slowing economic and earnings growth and tight credit conditions will also make it hard for some companies to refinance their debt next year, he said.
MORTGAGE shoppers may often feel at a distinct bargaining disadvantage because they are not privy to the same information about interest rates as loan officers and brokers.
A new service, on TrueCredit.com, aims to help tilt the balance in favor of borrowers — and perhaps save them from an unnecessary round of inquiries to mortgage brokers in the first place.
Other online mortgage estimators cannot go this far, mostly because the typical consumer does not know his or her credit score, which is a critical factor in determining the mortgage rate.
TrueCredit’s simulator, which costs $10 to use for a month, can return valuable loan information quickly.
Users type in their preferred loan size and down payment, Social Security number, the address of the property and their monthly debts and annual income.
The service retrieves the consumer’s credit score and, a moment later, displays rates for a range of mortgage products.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Along with the results, borrowers are offered a “what if” tool, which enables them to play with different variables — for instance, the down payment amount or the credit score — to see how such adjustments might change the interest rate.
During a recent trial, for instance, this tool suggested a user would qualify for a 6.49 percent rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan for $210,000.
Changing the loan amount to $260,000 increased the interest rate to 6.52 percent, and the monthly payment by $334.
These are not actual loan offers, but rather estimates based on what banks nationwide are charging similar borrowers.
That data, which is produced by the Heitman Group, a mortgage consulting business in Eugene, Ore., does not yet take into account regional differences, so borrowers in different states may pay more or less than the rate quoted on TrueCredit.com.

Because that data is a national average, TrueCredit.com does not specify the lowest rates available on the market.
Given that lenders can sometimes offer rates a percentage point or more below the national average on a particular day, users of the Mortgage Simulator should be prepared to seek even lower rates if they go ahead with their mortgage plans.
Steven Katz, the director of consumer education for TrueCredit.com, maintained that the Web site’s information is still highly useful.
“You can print this out, call your lender and say that you should be able to get 6.5 percent on a mortgage, and ask them if they can beat that,” he said.
“So you’re coming into the negotiation from a position of power.”
Of equal importance, borrowers can postpone their mortgage shopping if the Mortgage Simulator suggests they cannot qualify for a reasonably priced loan.
That has advantages beyond saving time, because loan officers must obtain a borrower’s credit score for each application, and that action alone can sometimes drop a borrower’s score by five points.
Because borrowers obtain their scores on TrueCredit.com directly from the credit bureau, they suffer no similar credit score damage.
“What I like most about it is its independent, unbiased nature,” he said.
Other online services may offer mortgage rates, Mr. Strothkamp added, but they also accept advertisements from lenders, thereby making that information appear less trustworthy.

The Tribune Company, the newspaper chain that owns The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times, is trying to negotiate new terms with its creditors and has hired advisers for a possible bankruptcy filing, according to people briefed on the matter.
Tribune is in danger of falling below the cash flow required under its agreement with its bondholders, but it is not clear how seriously Tribune is thinking about seeking bankruptcy protection.
Analysts and bankruptcy experts say that the hiring of advisers, including Lazard and Sidley Austin, one of the company’s longtime law firms, could be a just-in-case move, or a bargaining tactic.
The company would not comment on Sunday.
It has struggled since then under the resulting debt, forcing deep cuts at its newspapers.
The Tribune Company owns 23 TV stations and 12 newspapers, including two of the eight largest in the country by circulation.
Tribune has been trying to sell the Chicago Cubs baseball team; the team’s stadium, Wrigley Field; and the company’s share in a regional cable sports network.
Such a deal, which could bring the company more than $1 billion, has been a crucial part of its strategy since last year.

But the sale — originally expected to take place before the last baseball season — has been delayed by several factors, including the tight credit market.
It is not clear how recent federal allegations of insider trading against Mark Cuban, believed to be the highest bidder, could affect the sale.
Rating agencies say Tribune’s short-term problem is not in making payments on its debt.
Instead, the company is struggling to comply with a requirement that its main debt from its acquisition of the company not exceed nine times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

A quarterly test of that compliance is expected at the end of this month.
Technical defaults can sometimes lead to bankruptcy.
Companies in that position usually negotiate new terms with their lenders, often paying higher interest rates in return for less stringent cash-flow requirements.
But such negotiations have become more difficult in recent years, as lenders have become more likely to sell pieces of debt to third parties, which must approve any new terms.
Like most newspapers, Tribune’s have suffered double-digit percentage declines in advertising this year, as ads and readers continue to shift to the Internet, and the recession has prompted retailers and other businesses to curtail their ad spending.
What makes Tribune’s problems more serious is the heavy debt load it carries as a result of last year’s buyout.
The weak state of newspapers has made some lenders more loath than usual to force bankruptcy, fearing that it could worsen their chance of significant recovery, or at least delay it.
The companies that own The Inquirer and The Daily News in Philadelphia and The Star Tribune in Minneapolis recently suspended debt payments but have not filed for bankruptcy.
As the economy weakens, other lenders have become more aggressive about forcing debtors into bankruptcy when they believe such a move is inevitable, to preserve a company’s valuable cash reserves.
Delaying can make it hard to emerge from bankruptcy successfully.
That does not mean they are atheists.
Craving an authentic national faith, Estonians have been drawn to the animistic religions that preceded Christianity: Taarausk, whose god was worshiped in forest groves, and Maausk, which translates as “faith of the earth.”

Ancient beliefs have survived in the form of folk tales.
In stories, the sins of humans reverberate in nature — lakes fly away to punish greedy villagers, or forests wander off in the night, never to return.
Trees demand the respect of a tipped hat, and holes in the ground must be fed with coins.
In the case of Tuhala, the physical world begs for such explanations.
The settlement, believed to be 3,000 years old, sits on Estonia’s largest field of porous karst, where 15 underground rivers flow through a maze of caverns, audible but unseen by human inhabitants.

One result is sinkholes large enough to swallow horses — the Horse’s Hole, as it is known, appeared in 1978 — or people, as in the Mother-in-Law’s Hole.
Streams appear and disappear like phantoms.
The most famous oddity is the Witch’s Well.
Geologists believe that after flooding rains, underground water pressure builds to the point that water shoots up out of the ground, usually for a few days.
Each time it happens, people travel great distances to see it.
Her special ally is a birch tree in her yard, so powerful that a malicious neighbor has plotted to kill it, she said.
When she cuts roses and sets them in a vase, she said, they sprout roots.
These dramas, she said, are an “inheritance” from her ancestors.
“There is an old Estonian god, Taara,” Ms. Rouk said.
“He lives.
He exists.
Though there are people who would like to get rid of him.”

“Christians,” she added, “have no respect for nature.”
Magic seems to be back in fashion, said Evi Tuttelberg, who lives in a 500-year-old farmhouse near the well.
Ms. Tuttelberg, 80, used to laugh when her mother-in-law reported seeing flaming devils flying over Tuhala.

“No one used to talk about it,” she said.
That would mean this year’s eruption could be the last.
The mining company has offered to pipe in fresh drinking water to compensate for the 1,000 wells that could run dry, he said.
In addition, for a brief moment, investors were willing to take a small loss for holding another ultra-safe security, the already-issued three-month Treasury bill.

In these times, it seems, the abnormal has now become acceptable.
As America’s debt and deficit spiral from a parade of billion dollar bailouts and stimulus packages, fund managers, foreign governments and big retail investors reckon they will get more peace of mind by stashing their cash, rather than putting it toward any of the higher-yielding risk that is entailed in stocks, corporate bonds and consumer debt.
The rapid decline in Treasury yields — which since summer have headed toward lows not seen since the end of the World War II — also renders the Federal Reserve less effective, as investors and banks stuff the money that the central bank is pumping into the financial system into Treasuries, rather than fanning it out across the broader economy.
“If people are so busy during the day just protecting the cash they have, it’s not a good sign.”
Stocks fell sharply as investors digested the implications.
If there is a silver lining to the Treasury market’s gyrations, it is that the United States can borrow money more cheaply from investors, whether they be the governments of China or Japan, or big fund managers.
That could help Washington finance various programs intended to revive the ailing economy.
Borrowing by the Treasury has already ballooned since Congress approved the $700 billion financial rescue plan, and policy makers expect the federal budget deficit to swell further next year as the Big Three automakers and other industries look for support.

“That sucking sound is all the world’s capital going into the U.S. Treasury market,” Mr. Yardeni said, “which means the Treasury and the Fed can tap into that liquidity pool to finance TARP and offer mortgages at 4.5 percent.”
While that may offset some of the expense of the bailouts, economists say the fact that the United States must borrow so much to prop up large parts of the economy is a big cause for concern.
There are several explanations for the flight to safety in the bond market.
The world of short-term money market funds, for instance, is still reeling from troubles at the Reserve Primary Fund, a money market fund frozen in September after it lost money on investments in Lehman Brothers.
Since then, individual and large investors have put more than $200 billion into money funds that only invest in safe Treasury bills, according to iMoneyNet, a financial data publisher.
At the same time, investors have withdrawn nearly $400 billion from prime funds.

That has forced portfolio managers to buy Treasury bills, driving down yields.
“That group of investors has to invest in something,” said Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors.
“They don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘I will stick it in the mattress.’ ”
Yields for longer term Treasury securities have also slumped, with the 10-year now yielding 2.64 percent, down from 2.7 percent Monday and 3.75 percent a month earlier.
That decline appears to reflect several other forces.
Many investors are seeking safety because they believe that the economy is in its worst recession since the Depression.
Rather than inflation, which was a worry for some a few months ago, many are now worried about deflation, or falling prices.
Thomas H. Atteberry, a bond fund manager, said at current prices the market is predicting that the United States will suffer the kind of “lost decade” that Japan suffered in the 1990s.
“I have a hard time justifying that,” said Mr. Atteberry, a partner at First Pacific Advisors.
“The Fed seems much more upfront about boosting its balance sheet by creating money.”
Another reason, analysts say, that Treasury yields may be falling is that foreign investors are using American government securities to protect themselves against the falling value of their own currencies.
Many investors are also pulling money out of mutual funds and hedge funds, forcing portfolio managers to sell more risky assets and hold Treasuries, which are easier to sell.
And some fund managers are simply looking to dress up their portfolios before the year ends.
“There is no doubt that there is potentially some hoarding of cash in anticipation of potential redemptions,” said David Kovacs, a strategist at Turner Investment Partners.
“People want to own it to show that they played it safe by year-end.”
HONG KONG — South Korea’s central bank on Thursday announced the deepest cut in interest in its history in an attempt to cushion its economy from the global downturn.
The announcement followed China’s disclosure that its economic indicators for November showed the country’s economy slowing much more rapidly than expected, increasing expectations that Beijing will accelerate efforts to bolster growth.
Central banks around the world have delivered a cascade of cuts as the speed of the economic slowdown — and outright recession in the United States, Canada, Japan and much of Europe — becomes apparent.
On Wednesday, trade data showed import growth dropping sharply and exports shrinking for the first time in years as domestic and overseas demand shrank.

The Chinese data added to the sense of worry about the extent to which Asia’s economies are being affected by the economic downturn that was set off last year by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
It also dashed hopes that China’s economy could act as a buffer by taking up the slack from the slumping United States, Europe and Japan.
China’s double-digit growth is expected to slow to around 8 percent next year, and growth across the region is also forecast to decline as demand in Europe and the United States and within the region shrinks.
The estimates echoed those issued by the World Bank earlier this week.
Jong-Wha Lee, head of the Asian Development Bank’s s office of regional economic integration, said that “2009 is likely to be a very difficult year for developing Asia.”
The bank called on governments to step up efforts to bolster their economies.
“While the region’s economies and financial systems are fundamentally sound and appear better cushioned to withstand the immediate effects of the crisis than in other parts of the world,” the bank said it was concerned “that the global credit crunch is now spilling over into domestic banking systems, squeezing funding resources for corporate investment.”
Is Wall Street developing a thicker skin?
But some analysts have been saying that investors have priced in a recession, and Wall Street’s relatively quiet close on Friday suggested as much.
That would be a change from October and November, when even minor omens of gloom led to declines of hundreds of points.
The possibility of bankruptcy filings by two automakers — General Motors and Chrysler — could have major consequences for the domestic job market and the global economy, as well as stoking fears of deflation.

But the comments from the White House, along with gains in technology and financial stocks, helped ease some of the anxiety.
Chrysler is not publicly traded.

The 2.2 percent drop was led by a sharp decline in gasoline prices, which should offer some relief to businesses.
But economists are concerned about the prospect of deflation, a period of sustained price drops that can hurt the economy.
Stocks are up 9 percent since Nov. 20.
Some analysts call the winning streak a bear market rally — a temporary reprieve amid a broader downturn — although a brave few have proffered predictions that the bottom of the market crash had already been reached.
A major test could come on Tuesday, when policy makers at the Federal Reserve meet.
Investors expect the central bankers to lower their benchmark interest rate.
On Dec. 23, the Commerce Department will release its first estimate of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter.
Many economists are bracing for a contraction of as much as 5 percent, which could be the worst quarter since 1982.
The basic question Keynes asked was: How do rational people behave under conditions of uncertainty?
People fall back on “conventions,” which give them the assurance that they are doing the right thing.
The chief of these are the assumptions that the future will be like the past (witness all the financial models that assumed housing prices wouldn’t fall) and that current prices correctly sum up “future prospects.” Above all, we run with the crowd.
A master of aphorism, Keynes wrote that a “sound banker” is one who, “when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way.” (Today, you might add a further convention — the belief that mathematics can conjure certainty out of uncertainty.)

But any view of the future based on what Keynes called “so flimsy a foundation” is liable to “sudden and violent changes” when the news changes.
Investors do not process new information efficiently because they don’t know which information is relevant.
Conventional behavior easily turns into herd behavior.
Financial markets are punctuated by alternating currents of euphoria and panic.

Keynes’s prescriptions were guided by his conception of money, which plays a disturbing role in his economics.
Most economists have seen money simply as a means of payment, an improvement on barter.
The “desire to hold money as a store of wealth is a barometer of the degree of our distrust of our own calculations and conventions concerning the future.
The possession of actual money lulls our disquietude; and the premium we require to make us part with money is a measure of the degree of our disquietude.” The same reliance on “conventional” thinking that leads investors to spend profligately at certain times leads them to be highly cautious at others.
Even a relatively weak dollar may, at moments of high uncertainty, seem more “secure” than any other asset, as we are currently seeing.
It is this flight into cash that makes interest-rate policy such an uncertain agent of recovery.
If the managers of banks and companies hold pessimistic views about the future, they will raise the price they charge for “giving up liquidity,” even though the central bank might be flooding the economy with cash.
That is why Keynes did not think that cutting the central bank’s interest rate would necessarily — and certainly not quickly — lower the interest rates charged on different types of loans.
Spend on pyramids, spend on hospitals, but spend it must.
Now that Greenspan’s intellectual edifice has collapsed, the moment has come to build a new structure on the foundations that Keynes laid.
