But Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University charges that the ''fund is unqualified to assume its new tasks.''

''Its structure harks back to its founding 50 years ago and ill serves today's needs,'' he said.
And even if the I.M.F.
has the will, it no longer has the way to impose its views.
Almost everyone agrees that it cannot perform its current mission with the sums -- now down to well under $100 billion by any accounting -- left in its coffers.
Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that ''the fund may need another $200 billion just to bail out Brazil without imposing a severe recession.''
So the I.M.F.
needs to change.
But how?
Economists have produced a number of answers.
Some call for expanding the I.M.F.
's powers to aid crippled economies, perhaps by turning it into a true ''lender of last resort'' that disburses money to prop up countries in financial distress.
Others would expand its mission by having it insure foreign loans.
Yet another group would take the opposite tack, trimming the role of the institution.
They would offer bailouts to fewer countries, or focus the fund's efforts on convening negotiations between debtor countries and their creditors.
But much of the disagreement flows from one deep-seated dispute -- whether a territory as small as Hong Kong or a country as large as Brazil should fix their currencies in terms of dollars or let them float according to the vagaries of the market.
If the members of the I.M.F.
could settle the issue of exchange rates, many of the other policy issues would fall quietly into line.
Countries adopt a fixed exchange rate -- a pledge to convert currencies into dollars at a preset rate -- in part to reassure investors that their money is safe.
But fixed rates get countries into financial trouble when, for whatever reason, investors get spooked and all rush for the exits at the same time.
With trillions of dollars sloshing around world capital markets, the dollar reserves of nearly every country can be decimated in days, if not seconds.
Russia, like some other countries, brought disaster on itself by printing too many rubles.
The more ominous lesson of the last few years is that fickle investors can also rock countries that conduct prudent policies.
Mr. Krugman worries that it takes ''a minority of skittish investors to set off a self-justifying run on the country's reserves.''
The upshot is that countries that pledge to preserve fixed rates at any cost are sometimes forced to do exactly that: Sweden in 1993, Brazil today and scores of other countries whose currencies have come under attack have been forced to jack up domestic interest rates to 40, 50 or 100 percent or more to convince investors to stay.
High rates can stop the outflow of dollars, but they also crush the domestic economy.
Indeed, the fund is criticized for strangling the economies of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand last year by needlessly insisting they impose sky-high interest rates as part of their fund-approved packages.
Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, argues that fixed rates do not work well with unlimited capital flows.
His answer is to let currencies float.
''The mistake was holding onto the fixed rates.
They become a trap if kept longer than necessary, say 18 months or so.''

By proposing that countries move to freely floating rates, Mr. Sachs hopes to minimize the possibility of sudden currency collapses.
He would urge the fund to help countries whose currencies are under attack, but only after the currency is set free.
The money would be used to mitigate the impact of devaluation on the poor and to reassure investors that the country's finances would be sound and its currency unlikely to plunge much further.
Mr. Sachs also urges the fund to focus less on bailing out debtor countries than on helping them negotiate relief from their creditors.
When a debtor cannot repay loans in the United States, the courts step in and suspend payments until a settlement that is fair to all creditors can emerge.
Mr. Sachs wants a similar procedure internationally.

''So while international debt negotiations lack the legal protections to work in theory,'' Mr. Sachs said, ''they somehow manage to work in practice.''
Mr. Meltzer starts from the same presumption as Mr. Sachs -- that fixed rates do not work well in a world of vast capital flows -- but comes to a different conclusion.
He wants to minimize the role of the fund, whose bailouts, he argues, have done a lot of harm.
His solution is to turn the fund into a limited lender of last resort, lending money to debtor countries for a fee.
But debtors would have to post ample collateral.
That leaves Mr. Meltzer vulnerable to the charge that his plan would bail out only countries that do not need the fund's help.
And in a sense, he agrees: Classic economic thinking suggests bailing out only those borrowers who are merely illiquid, simply lacking ready cash to pay back creditors while holding ample assets, but not those who are insolvent, without enough assets to cover their debts.
But many economists, and these include key policy makers like Stanley Fischer, the fund's No.
2 official, regard floating rates as unacceptably risky for developing countries.
Fickle investors, controlling trillions of dollars, can drive currency values up and down in huge swings for seemingly no valid economic reason.
Sudden currency swings play havoc with people's lives.
Depreciation can decimate industries that rely on imported parts, turning once secure jobs into rubble.
In Asia, steep currency declines sent the price of imports skyrocketing, impoverishing millions last year.
That threatens many banks throughout Asia and Latin America.
''It is no accident,'' Mr. Fischer said, ''that countries turn to fixed rates to bring order to their economies.''

Economists who tie themselves to fixed rates also tie themselves to the I.M.F.
The world simply needs some institution to lend money to countries whose reserves are temporarily under attack, they say.
That is why Mr. Bergsten, who advocates rates that are flexible only enough to float within a preset range, argues for making the fund work better within its existing role.
He would have the fund scrutinize pertinent financial data of its member nations and intervene early before they run into problems.
As part of his ''I.M.F.
plus'' proposal, he would also require the fund to eliminate the worst feature of its Mexican and Asian bailouts.
Under those programs, Western creditors were hardly nicked, encouraging them to take imprudent risks elsewhere.
The most direct way to correct this ''moral hazard'' is for the fund to pressure creditors to offer significant debt relief.
George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has a more ambitious plan.
''International capital movements need to be supervised and the allocation of credit regulated by an international authority,'' he argues.
Mr. Soros proposes, as yet without detail, that a new spin-off of the I.M.F.
calm jittery foreign investors by ''guaranteeing international loans for a modest fee'' up to a limit.
The guarantees would be backed by special drawing rights that, in effect, use American dollars -- together with backing from other major countries -- perhaps without explicit Congressional permission.
Even if Mr. Soros's proposal could overcome political objections on Capitol Hill, there are still practical challenges to the idea.
Loan insurance encourages investors to ignore the creditworthiness of borrowers, which is why it is limited in the United States to relatively small deposits in commercial banks and savings and loans.
His proposal may invite reckless investing.
There are also proposals, most recently by Jeffrey Garten, a former Commerce Department official, to turn the fund or some other institution into a global central bank able to issue money whenever the international economy sags.
But economists point out that his bank would require gargantuan resources and the legal power to intervene in the economies of member countries.
There will be lots of talk of reform this week when the I.M.F.
and World Bank hold their semiannual meetings.
Even if there is as yet no consensus for radical overhaul, the fund's survival may depend on its ability to borrow at least some of what its critics propose.
Yesterday, the day after the Federal Reserve cut its short-term interest rate target one-quarter point in an effort to prevent the financial crisis abroad from derailing the American economy, all the news seemed to point to things getting worse, not better.

More companies offered warnings that their earnings would come in below forecasts, adding to the gloom that has analysts predicting that earnings will decline in the third quarter for the first time since the fourth quarter of 1991.
While the fund denied the rumor, the fact that such rumors spread so easily these days is a sign of negative investor sentiment.
The rumor helped drag down shares of banks and brokerage firms, which have been among the hardest hit in the stock market decline since mid-July.
And even the news of declining interest rates was not all that positive.
''The current rally is based on growing expectations of negative economic developments,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company.
Robert V. DiClemente, the chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney, added, ''This is not the way we would have liked bonds to go through 5 percent.''
In addition, while lower interest rates will help home buyers and consumers, the downward rush in Government yields has left the rates on other debt, like that of corporations, much higher as investors have chosen the safety of Government-backed bonds over even those of companies with good credit ratings.
As the Fed cuts interest rates, he said, ''there is no assurance that financial conditions will be easier.''
The drop in interest rates was apparently a key contributor to the losses at Long-Term Capital, meaning that further declines could mean harder times for it and other hedge funds that bet that Treasury yields would not fall this far this fast.

It is also probably contributing to losses for many Wall Street firms for the same reason.
While the decline in Treasury rates may be hurting firms on Wall Street, many analysts say the Fed did not cut rates enough on Wednesday to send a reassuring signal to other countries that the American economy will continue to grow and be a market for their exports.
''I think this is a time when you have to take pre-emptive action,'' said Nicholas P. Sargen, the global market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients.
In his view, it is clear that the global economic crisis is now impinging enough on the American economy to offset any inflationary threat from an interest rate cut that encourages growth.
The price on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, jumped 1 29/32, to 108 4/32.
The yield of 4.97 percent was down from 5.09 percent on Tuesday and is off three-quarters of a percentage point since the Dow hits its peak on July 17.
The yield on the 10-year note, which is a benchmark for home mortgages, dropped to 4.41 percent, from 4.56 percent on Tuesday, its lowest since the end of 1965.
''When you see bond prices go up this much and stock prices go down this much, the message is clear,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
''Investors are becoming much more worried about the economy and earnings than they had been.''
In addition, there were signals from Europe that earnings are under pressure there.
According to I.B.E.S.
International, which monitors analysts' earnings forecasts, profits for the companies in the S.& P. 500 will fall by 2.2 percent in the third quarter.

Early today, the Nikkei plunged at the opening to below 13,000, nearly a 13-year low, before recovering to end the morning session little changed.
''It's sort of a referendum on the fact that the crisis keeps smoldering and no one has confidence that anybody's going to extinguish it,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis.
Stocks of financial institutions in the United States, exposed to turmoil in emerging markets, write-offs of hedge fund losses and other domestic debt as well as the possibility of recession, took some of the heaviest battering.

''Worldwide events have superseded what the I.M.F.
can handle,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities.
''The economy's not falling out of bed,'' he said, even though growth in the United States would not be much faster than a 2 percent annual pace in the quarter that ended Wednesday and perhaps as little as 1 percent in the year's final quarter.
At a Congressional inquiry into hedge funds, one source of current instability, Mr. Greenspan resisted suggestions for tight regulation, saying that such moves might be counterproductive by driving those operations abroad.
Merrill Lynch was one of the many prominent casualties among financial stocks, sliding 3 3/16 a share, to 44, after trading as low as 42 9/16 during the day -- down from a high of 109 1/8 on July 13.
''You have a flight to stability and stocks with good dividends,'' said Daniel B. Eagan, a portfolio manager at Black Rock in Philadelphia.
Here in North Carolina's Fourth Congressional District, Mr. Price, acknowledging that his own polls showed him in a tight race, said: ''This is a swing district that is sensitive to any tide or trend.

The efforts of Mr. Price and Mrs. Carson to contain the Lewinsky debacle -- and their opponents' attempts to capitalize on it -- offer important clues suggesting how President Clinton's problems are influencing the conduct of races around the country.
Many Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to appear close to a President whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing the possibility of a public backlash against Republicans, they are weighing their words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon.
And while these Democrats publicly express confidence that the scandal will have little impact on them, their campaigns are preparing for the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-scenes efforts to prod their core constituencies to vote.
In a reflection of the uncertainty that the Clinton scandal has cast even among Republicans, the challengers in the Price and Carson districts -- both are political novices seeking office for the first time -- have differing strategies:

Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Mr. Price, has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal.
''Tom Roberg has called for Bill Clinton's resignation,'' the narrator says.
''This is not the time to be silent, Mr. Price.
Where do you stand?''
But in Indianapolis, Gary A. Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking a more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he notes as often as he can that ''Julia votes with Clinton almost 100 percent of the time.''
Asked why he was not much raising the scandal directly, Mr. Hofmeister said: ''Don't murder somebody when they're in the process of committing suicide.
There would be a danger if we went overboard.''
The best evidence of the discomfort of both Mr. Price and Mrs. Carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they would want Mr. Clinton to campaign in their districts, both said it would be impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a visit.
''Given the President's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me,'' Mrs. Carson said.
And Mr. Price?
''I don't think that would be such a good idea,'' he said.
''I've never had a President campaign here, and I wouldn't want to start this time'' (although he is welcoming Erskine B. Bowles, the President's chief of staff and a popular native son in North Carolina, to stump with him on Sunday).

Making strategy for the stump is further complicated by anecdotal evidence that runs counter to Democratic fears and Republican hopes.
In three days of campaign stops in Indianapolis and here in North Carolina, the scandal was rarely raised by any voter being courted by the candidates of either party.
''It shouldn't have gotten this far.''

''There has to be rule of law,'' he said.
Mrs. Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing voters alike would become so fed up with the Lewinsky inquiry that the issue might even help her.
To that end, she proudly informs audiences that she voted against making public the report delivered to the House by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
The Carson campaign is counting on voters like Timothy D. Daly, a 38-year-old real estate executive who voted for a Republican two years ago but now favors Mrs. Carson.
''I'm pulling the Democratic ticket because I'm tired of it: the right side of the Republican Party is playing politics,'' Mr. Daly said.
''We'd like to see them go on with the people's business.''
Back here in the Fourth District, Mr. Price has some reasons to be worried.
In addition, the district was redrawn last year to include a large Durham section, where voters do not know him well.
Determined not to be a midterm casualty of Mr. Clinton once again, Mr. Price says he is waging the most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign of his career.

Rather than engage Mr. Roberg over the Clinton scandal, Mr. Price has begun broadcasting a television commercial that emphasizes his central issue: education.
The Congressman's advisers say they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly nonpolitical -- it features schoolchildren in a play -- in an effort to break through the television clutter about the scandal.
But the Price campaign also has a weapon it is holding in reserve, in the event Mr. Roberg appears to be riding the Clinton scandal to advantage: the incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid about running commercials underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting his doctorate in political science.
At a coffee with voters in a wealthy enclave of Raleigh the other night, Mr. Roberg opened by asserting that Mr. Clinton had ''lost the moral authority to lead.''
''I don't know how it's going to play,'' he said.
''People are tired of hearing this story, to a certain extent.''
Mr. Price seems just as uncertain.
''I know the other one is calling for the resignation of the President,'' Ms. Scott said, ''and that's a big one for me right now.''
It will mean stretching, Mrs. Farrell said.
''We won't be able to put as much aside into our retirement account as we have been, there won't be as many dinners out and we'll be keeping things to a minimum for at least a year,'' she said.
''But it puts us into the size house that we would like to be in.''

Similar buying and selling decisions have been stoking the market despite the rise in house prices in the last year.
Nevertheless, said Joseph E. Mottola, chief executive of the Long Island Board of Realtors, ''I'm not getting any kind of sense that affordability is an issue -- people are not complaining about what they have to pay.''
He attributed that to ''favorable interest rates, the availability of a variety of financing programs to fit everybody's needs and a general business optimism about being employed and doing well.''
Andrew Thaw, a partner of Whitman Thaw and Associates, mortgage bankers in Melville, and the president of the New York Society of Mortgage Professionals, a trade group, noted that even if a house goes up $10,000, the monthly cost would be more than offset by a drop of one percentage point in interest rates, assuming a 10 percent down payment is made in both cases.
He explained that with a 10 percent down payment, a $150,000 house would require a $135,000 mortgage that at 8 percent interest over 30 years would cost $990.58 a month.
A 10 percent down payment on a $160,000 house would require a $144,000 mortgage that at an interest rate of 7 percent would cost only $958.04 a month.
The State of New York Mortgage Agency has programs that allow first-time buyers to finance 100 percent of the cost of both a new and a resale house, said Joseph S. Rizzo, a mortgage representative for the Bank of New York Mortgage Company in Riverhead, which is a member of the housing partnership.
Family income can be $90,000 or more, depending on the number of family members, Mr. Rizzo said.
A point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount.

Still, rising prices have forced many buyers to scale back on their dream house, compromising either on neighborhood or size.
An example of how prices have gone up in a year is a house she listed a year ago for $225,000 in Williston Park, said Evelyn Atanas, a Williston Park broker.
Neal and Anne Ressa, who are first-time buyers, started looking for a house a year ago before settling on one in Mineola, which they found through Atanas Realty.

Mrs. Ressa works for a department store as a personal shopper.
But in Port Washington, they would have had to pay at least $250,000 for a smaller house, he explained.
Brokers, especially those in Nassau, report there is very little left even in the $200,000 range.
''I have buyers come in saying, 'I can spend up to $200,000,' which is an incredible amount of money especially if you're a young couple just starting out,'' said Renee Luft, a sales agent with the Century 21 Prevete real estate agency in Hicksville.
''But for $200,000, you don't get very much anymore.''
Even so, brokers say that buyers today are very knowledgeable and are not inclined to overpay.
''Even in today's hot market, pricing is crucial,'' said Katy Anastasio, owner of Anastasio Associates, a Huntington real estate broker.
New-house prices are rising along with those of resale houses.
Depending on the development, prices have risen $5,000 to $25,000 a house in the last year, said Marilyn Larsen of Great Neck, a marketing consultant to builders.
''And there has been no resistance,'' she added, noting that she is able to lock in today's low interest rates for nine months until a house is delivered.
Builders say they are forced to raise prices because they face rising costs.
''I don't raise prices frivolously,'' said Steven A. Klar, an East Meadow builder, ''but when we project out for a longer period of time, I anticipate cost increases in insulation and other materials, and I have to consider the cost of holding land.''

In his current development, Waterways at Moriches, he is building 274 units consisting of two-bedroom apartments and two-bedroom semiattached houses for people 55 or older.
The new prices range from $175,000 for an apartment to $250,000 for a semiattached house.
At the Villages at Huntington, where McGovern-Barbash Associates of Babylon is building 248 houses, prices, which started at $295,000 to $340,000 two years ago, have risen to $330,000 to $425,000.
The cost of materials and labor has also gone up, said Susan Barbash, one of the principals.
But buyers willing to move farther east into subdivisions just starting out can take advantage of preconstruction prices.
At a 72-house Yaphank development called Fairway Woods under construction by J. D. O. C. Construction of Yaphank, preconstruction prices range from $149,900 for a three-bedroom high ranch to $182,900 for a four-bedroom colonial.
But by Columbus Day, when models open, those prices will go up at least $5,000, said Mrs. Larsen of Great Neck, who is in charge of marketing.
Among her customers are John Jackson, a New York City police officer, and his wife, Nancy, an insurance claims representative.
They have contracted to buy the $182,900 colonial, having just sold their three-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot Ronkonkoma ranch for $148,500.
Because they hope to lock in a 6.625 percent interest mortgage, their new house will cost them only $150 a month more, including taxes, Mrs. Jackson said.
Will that mean a sharp price drop?

The mood instead runs from aloof, condemning cynicism to scathing anger.
The new templates of the genre are Patrick Marber's wildly acclaimed ''Closer,'' a brutal look at an internecine romantic quadrangle (headed for Broadway next year), and Mark Ravenhill's notorious ''Shopping and .
.
. ''
(seen in New York last season), works in which carnal knowledge, explicitly documented, is unsatisfying and unenlightening.
The hottest ticket in London is David Hare's ice-cold reworking of ''La Ronde,'' by Arthur Schnitzler.
This is the two-character show in which the movie star Nicole Kidman has made her London stage debut to delirious reviews, playing five women who look for love in all the wrong places, the point being that no place is the right place.
The single most unsettling, and representative, image to emerge from my 10 days of playgoing here comes from Mr. Ravenhill's latest offering, ''Handbag,'' in which a young woman is digitally brought to orgasm, by a man who might as well be a vibrator, while standing up and wearing a mask that suggests an extraterrestrial pig.
She is transformed by sex, for sure, but not into anything human.
Let's not forget that for centuries England has been dancing an uneasy waltz between tight-lipped puritanism (think Oliver Cromwell) and open-mouthed hedonism (think Christine Keeler), nor that the sort of sexual shenanigans now tainting the American Presidency are nothing new to the British.
In living memory, the country has seen a government unseated and its monarchy threatened by such activities.
Both phenomena are currently represented on the boards with the West End production of ''A Letter of Resignation,'' Hugh Whitemore's look at the Profumo scandal of the 1960's, and the delectably silly and oddly affecting ''Love Upon the Throne'' (written by Patrick Barlow and performed by Mr. Barlow and John Ramm, the entire company of the self-styled National Theater of Brent), in which two middle-aged, bespectacled men in business suits awkwardly enact the troubled courtship and marriage of Prince Charles and Lady Diana.
There's a genuine warmth to ''Throne,'' something notably absent from much of the rest of London's popular theatrical fare.
This doesn't mean, however, that audience and critical response to consciously chilly productions has been comparably detached.
The English clearly like to have their cake and drool over it, too.
Just consider the reviews garnered by Ms. Kidman in the Donmar Warehouse production of ''The Blue Room,'' staged by the omnipresent Sam Mendes, with Iain Glen (a classical actor who, surprisingly, tends toward cartoonishness here) playing the other halves of a series of erotically linked couples.
That Ms. Kidman gives an exceptionally proficient performance, nimbly shifting accents and embodying characters from a Cockney streetwalker to a self-dramatizing, self-adoring stage star, was duly noted by most critics.
The Evening Standard, which knows its priorities, wedged a brief critical appraisal of the play beneath a splashy assessment of Ms. Kidman's physique.

Well, maybe, if you're stimulated by the idea of copulation as a purely mechanical activity, something wittily emphasized here by the super titles that tabulate the time consumed by each sexual act.
The daisy chain of couplings in Mr. Hare's rather perfunctory modernization of Schnitzler's classic is a joyless cycle of users and the used, and it lacks the depths of passion and character that infuse the playwright's best works.
Unlike the original ''La Ronde,'' this adaptation gives off about as much Weltschmerz as the lurid neon lighting in which it is bathed.

Darkly Up to Date In 'Oklahoma!'
Audiences seeking to recover from the frostbite of ''The Blue Room'' might find it at the National Theater, the home of Trevor Nunn's triumphant revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Oklahoma!''
In this miraculously fresh-feeling production, which moves to the West End in January with (one prays) a Broadway engagement to follow, raging hormones may get people into trouble, but they are also a source of exuberant, unquenchable life.
This sensibility matches the robust, pioneer spirit of the show's world of farmers and cowboys.
The production has been restaged in ways that go beyond the usual respectful museum-piece revivals, with vital new choreography by Susan Stroman replacing the fabled dance numbers of Agnes de Mille.
Yet it comes closer than any version I've seen in creating a sense of how thrillingly novel the original production must have been.
Every song, even the chestnut of an opening number, ''Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin','' has a feeling of conversational spontaneity.
The show, populated with largely unknown but vigorously talented actors, seems propelled by young sexual urges uncertainly groping for an outlet, finding blissful release in dance.
The more troubled eroticism of the show is given appropriately shadowy life, most notably in Shuler Hensley's compellingly brutish Jud.
The threat of disruptive violence and the possibility of disappointments and losses to come are never far from the surface.
This acknowledgment of darkness only enhances the energy-charged light thrown off by the ensemble.
A similar exuberance could be found in the Globe Theater's brassy interpretation of ''A Mad World, My Masters,'' an early (1605) ribald comedy by Thomas Middleton.
The Globe has had a huge popular success, and this production makes it easy to see why.
The play, whose characters include a courtesan who has sold her virginity 15 times, is a reminder that a cynical take on sexual foibles is nothing new to the British theater and that such cynicism could also be fun.
Also on hand is a debauchee whose oxymoronic name speaks volumes about the English temperament: Penitent Brothel.
In the title role of the Almeida Theater's production of Racine's ''Phedre,'' directed by Jonathan Kent at the Albery Theater, Diana Rigg appears to be possessed by a succubus of some sort, and believe you me, she's not happy about it.
This fiercely intelligent actress creates a stinging portrait of a woman whose loins are directly at odds with her fine mind.
Desire is a cancer, and Ms. Rigg's contorted postures and bitter, enraged delivery suggest a pain as much physical as emotional.
Overall, the evening is too solemnly chic by half, with Maria Bjornson's elegant setting and costumes bringing to mind a fashion shoot by Horst.
Mr. Kent, who collaborated with Ms. Rigg on ''Medea,'' is not, to put it mildly, a relaxed director.
Here, he has his actors flattening themselves against the walls to express fear and sprinkling themselves with water in vain attempts to cool their characters' passions.

The approach verges on camp, particularly in Toby Stephens's tremulous, lip-biting performance as the unwilling object of Phedre's affection.
But Julian Glover is first-rate as Theseus, a strutting king whose bluster deflates into bewildered grief, and the blistering war against eroticism waged by Ms. Rigg's Phedre is unforgettable.
The contemporary characters in Mr. Ravenhill's ''Handbag,'' at the Lyric Studio in Hammersmith, don't put up much of a struggle against their carnal appetites.
This messy but intermittently powerful play juxtaposes two plots: the modern-day tale of two couples, one gay and one lesbian, who decide to rear a child together and a speculative version of the history of the misplaced baby in ''The Importance of Being Earnest.''
Neither the age of repression nor that of promiscuity makes good parents.
The people in Mr. Ravenhill's very bleak world are selfish creatures with short attention spans and muddled, conflicted notions of what it means to take care of someone else.
Directed by Nick Philippou, the production has the subtlety of a fire-and-brimstone revival meeting.
But the six-member cast brings a fearless, raw conviction to the evening, and unlike ''The Blue Room,'' ''Handbag'' locates the sharp pang of emptiness in its terminally dissatisfied characters.
Even in the midst of vividly simulated sexual acts, no one has a good time.
Royal Marriage A La Mode

The Prince and Princess of Wales, as incarnated in the ''Beyond the Fringe''-style antics of ''Love Upon the Throne,'' don't get much pleasure out of life, either.
England's most closely watched example of marital infidelity in recent years is rendered as a tale told by idiots, two bumblers of high aspirations and modest talent, named Desmond Oliver Dingle and Raymond Box (the alter egos of Mr. Barlow and Mr. Ramm).
But while they tend to get crucial details like the names of the royal family hilariously wrong, this hapless pair somehow gets the sad core of Charles and Diana's ill-starred relationship right.
Beneath the farcical high jinks, there's a current of wistfulness about one couple's inability to connect that taps into what made this royal marriage such a gripping and disturbing soap opera.
For the record, although a bed scene between Diana and one of her lovers is promised, it never actually takes place.
When Raymond Box learns the scene has been cut, he lets out a cyclonic sigh of relief.
DOLLAR FALLS AGAINST MARK.
The dollar declined for a sixth day on expectations the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates again.
Following are excerpts from statements today by President Clinton and the leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, at the two organizations' annual meeting:

By President Clinton

A half century ago, a visionary generation of leaders gathered at Bretton Woods to build a new economy to serve the citizens of every nation.
In one of his last messages to Congress, President Franklin Roosevelt said that the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and I quote, ''spell the difference between a world caught again in the maelstrom of panic and economic warfare or a world in which nations strive for a better life through mutual trust, cooperation and assistance.''

But now the health of Asia and indeed the world depends upon Japan.
Just as the United States had to eliminate its deficits and high interest rates, which were taking money away from the rest of the world, over the last six years, now Japan must take strong steps to restart its economic growth by addressing problems in the banking system so that lending and investment can begin with renewed energy and by stimulating, deregulating and opening its economy.
For all of us, there can be no substitute for action.
By Michel Camdessus, I.M.F.
It would be perhaps too dramatic yet to talk of global recession, but the evidence of the risks calls for immediate action.
Fortunately, in the industrial countries of North America and Europe the fundamentals remain sound.
For some time, inflation has been subdued.
Economic expansion continues in the United States, while in the economies of the euro area the recovery has continued to firm.
But even North America and Europe are not immune, and effects of the crisis are beginning to be felt.
.

If we expect any upturn next year, it will be because of the impressive steps by many countries, some of which were already implementing Fund-supported programs, to shield themselves against contagion.

An example at the onset of the crisis was the Philippines, which was able to absorb the worst of the successive waves of contagion by prolonging and rapidly strengthening an existing successful Fund-supported program.
The reaction of Latin American countries, so admirably illustrated by the remarks of President [Carlos Saul] Menem, is also to be lauded.
By jointly strengthening their defenses they have invited the markets to take greater account of the striking progress accomplished over the past decade and in particular since the Mexican crisis.
They have created the conditions for the Fund to negotiate promptly its financial support, if necessary.

We must address the issues of long-term equitable growth on which prosperity and human progress depend.
We must focus on the institutional and structural changes needed for recovery and sustainable development.
We must focus on the social issues.
We must do all this.
Because if we do not have the capacity to deal with social emergencies, if we do not have longer-term plans for solid institutions, if we do not have greater equity and social justice, there will be no political stability and without political stability no amount of money put together in financial packages will give us financial stability.
''There comes a time when you have to show that you don't accept what is going on,'' he said.
''The situation now is such that that time has come.''
Mr. Tyuterev does not begrudge the changes of the last years.
He and his wife, now on maternity leave with their 3-month-old baby, saved up enough one year to spend a month in India, the kind of private excursion that would have been impossible in Communist times.
And so he has no sympathy for the Communists, who together with the labor unions organized today's demonstrations.
''I do not want a Communist comeback,'' he said.
He is even ambivalent about calls for Mr. Yeltsin's resignation.
''Times change,'' he said.
''People change.
Our President has changed too.''
What he does want is a Government that will take charge and get the Russian economy working again.
But mainly, like many other Russians with a university degree and miserably paid jobs, Mr. Tyuterev is tired of being ignored.

''People are fed up with all this business,'' he said.
Like other Government workers, the forensic experts live on a fixed income -- although there is nothing fixed about a monthly salary of 1,200 rubles that did not materialize at all in September, which typically gets paid in dribs and drabs and which in dollar terms dropped from $200 to $80 after the ruble began its nose dive in August.

Mr. Tyuterev's family lives with his wife's parents, and even before the current crisis, neither he nor his wife could think of buying a car, let alone their own apartment, so the postponement of such dreams for them is no tragedy.
''In Russia, people who work for the Government are not middle-class, not by a long shot,'' said another colleague, Andrei Bobrov, 32, a ballistics expert and bachelor who lives with his mother, sister, brother-in-law and young nephew.
Mr. Bobrov has no time left for Mr. Yeltsin -- ''he is a clown'' -- and in the 1996 elections he voted first for Grigory A. Yavlinsky, leader of a liberal opposition party, and then in the second round ''against'' the Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov, Mr. Yeltsin's chief opponent.
But he still puzzles over the passivity of most Russians, who continue to put up with a miserly existence.
''A lot of people at the lab today were saying, 'Why go?'
''They all have their troubles, and they might come out and protest for themselves.
But they won't do it for the sake of groups that they think will use them for their own temporary political motives.''
Most central bankers are refusing to bend.

But the pressure is increasing.
In another sign of pressure, the Bank of England announced today that it would cut a key short-term interest rate by a quarter-point, to 7.25 percent.
For Britain, which has decided not to join the European currency union and follows a separate monetary policy, it was the first rate cut since June 1996.
In continental Europe, leaders are battling over fundamental economic policy.
With the Social Democrats' victory, Europe's biggest countries are or will soon be controlled by center-left governments.
A growing number of those governments now favor an easier monetary policy and would like to exert more political control over the European Central Bank.
Mr. Lafontaine has been an adamant critic of hawkish monetary policies.
Representing the Social Democrats' orthodox left wing, he has argued for years that such policies are the biggest culprits behind the nation's high unemployment.
French political leaders share those views.
the Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, has long advocated lower interest rates to spur job creation.
He has also bristled at the political independence given to the Bank of France and the new European Central Bank, calling for stronger political controls.
All of that runs counter to core principles of the European Central Bank and of individual national banks.
Because the euro will have its debut in January, the central banks of each member country have already locked their policies together into what amounts to a single framework.

By law, the new European Central Bank is allowed only to focus on the question of price stability and inflation.
Government leaders are not allowed to interfere or to influence any of its decisions.
''What we are seeing is indeed very significant,'' said Thomas Mayer, an economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt.
''We aren't used to having a government trying to influence monetary policy.
In the strategy of the new German Government, the role of monetary policy is obviously to spur economic growth and the creation of jobs.
That is obviously an approach that the central bankers of the European Central Bank do not share.''
Many economists argue that Europe is already following an expansionary monetary policy and does not need to change course.
Germany's basic short-term rate is 3.3 percent, and the average rate across the 11 countries in the ''euro zone'' is 3.7 percent -- significantly lower than in the United States, where rates are more than 5 percent.

Indeed, Mr. Tietmeyer and many private sector economists argue that Europe is already loosening monetary policy as it prepares for the euro.
That is because countries with traditionally high interest rates, like Spain and Italy, have to align their rates with those of Germany and France before the debut of the euro.
Until recently, most economists assumed that Germany would help close the gap by nudging its rates upward.
Instead, the central bankers appear determined to keep their rates low and let the other countries drop down to their level.
Despite the global financial turbulence, Dresdner Bank and many other institutions still predict that European economic growth will remain well above 2 percent next year and will exceed that of the United States.
That is because the United States is likely to be more affected by a slowdown in Latin America.
''The central bankers are confident that monetary policy in euroland is expansionary at the moment and will remain expansionary,'' said Stefan Bergheim, an economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt.
''We don't need to be lectured by central bankers who are running interest rates that are 20 percent higher than ours.''
Ah, excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt the fun Congress is having with its impeachment hearings and all.
But, well, there's just this little problem going on in the rest of the world.
It has to do with economics.
You see, the world's first truly global economy is going through its first truly serious global crisis.
If you follow the global credit crunch and market declines as they are displayed on graphs on a Bloomberg machine, they each look like an EKG tracking a massive heart attack.
So, you know, we might want to talk about it.
I mean, not all the time.
Maybe just in between the impeachment hearings and the release of the next Tripp tapes.
Like I said, I don't mean to interrupt ...
BUT HAVE WE GONE NUTS???
We are not just heading for lower growth, and possibly a recession.
We are seeing at minimum a slowdown and at a maximum a breakdown in the whole progression toward free-market capitalism.
That progression has enormously benefited Americans and millions of people in emerging markets, where $350 billion has been invested over the past decade.
Unfortunately, what is happening now is that those same investors are, without any distinctions between good and bad countries, pulling their money out in pursuit of lower and lower risks, putting all their money into T-bills or a mattress.
The net result is to choke off credit to everyone, from bad Russian banks to good Brazilian factories to promising American start-up companies, in a way that can only lead to misery and unemployment.
As the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, Robert Hormats, says, ''We have not seen a withdrawal of liquidity this big from the third world since the Good Lord parted the Red Sea to let the children of Israel walk through.''
Meanwhile, the Republican-led Congress is having a grand time, recklessly dragging out the impeachment of the President until Christmas -- and it's not even clear which Christmas.
This is not to say that because of this financial crisis we must ignore President Clinton's horrendous personal behavior.
But it is to say we've got to recognize that the global context that existed when this affair first erupted has fundamentally changed.
You may not know that from watching CNN or MSNBC, with their 24-hour-a-day impeach-a-tainment shows.
But it has.
And it has changed into a global crisis that requires enormous political leadership in general and U.S. leadership in particular.
It is time, therefore, to take Gerald Ford's advice and work out a censure plea bargain between Mr. Clinton, Kenneth Starr and Congress and be done with this affair -- now.

That is the sort of volatility you expect in the Mexican peso.
It just doesn't happen with the dollar.
It is like seeing a cat fly.
When panicked markets overshoot this badly, you have to overshoot them right back.
What is needed now are some holy-cow, in-your-face, stick-this-in-your-portfolio-and-smoke-it, confidence-building measures by the U.S., Europe and Japan to break the negative psychology of the markets and stoke up some real worldwide demand.
That requires, among other things, a U.S. President able to galvanize the process, explain it and press it forward.

It also requires a steep drop in the key interest rate by the Federal Reserve from the current level of 5.25 percent; an incremental drop won't do it.
And it may require using some of the budget surplus for a tax cut.
It also requires a cut in German-European interest rates.
And it certainly requires an emergency cleanup of the bankrupt Japanese banking system.
The real systemic threat to the global economy today is the continuing risk of large-scale bank failures in Japan.
This is not a test, folks.
If this credit crunch continues it will have enormously destabilizing effects.
Because on the one hand the world is telling developing countries to reform their economies, clean up their banks and get their financial software up to Western standards.
And on the other hand, it is telling them that they are going to have to do this with much, much less capital from the developed countries, or with much, much higher interest rates at home.
That is a prescription for political explosions all over the world.
The recent period of poor returns has brought to light flaws in the industry's practice of being all things to all people -- providing an endless variety of investment strategies, share classes and niche-filling funds.
By slicing the fund bologna so absurdly thin that it hardly serves as a snack, much less a nutritious meal, mutual fund companies, in many cases, have left people more confused than informed.

A scan of the list of funds that performed the best over the last 12 months, however, could impart a few basic facts -- and expose a few myths -- about investing.
And the lessons could serve investors well over the next year.
Some of the best performers over this period of market turmoil, for example, are funds that have the flexibility to add to or take away from asset classes like bonds or cash as the portfolio manager sees fit.
Those managers generally are not bound to stay fully invested all the time or to limit themselves to one type of stock, and thereby to take risks that few sensible investors would take on their own.
''A lot of people get caught up with exotic portfolio theory,'' said Scott W. Schoelzel, manager of the Janus Twenty fund, which, according to Morningstar, was the best-performing diversified stock fund over the last 12 months, gaining 32.5 percent.
''But I think I'm just like my shareholders.
I'm 40 years old, I'm saving for retirement and for my kids' college education, and I think about how would I do that if I were investing on my own and not running a fund.''
He does it by owning 20 or 30 stocks rather than 150, to better focus on his best ideas.
And Mr. Schoelzel lets cash build up to 20 percent or so of the portfolio when he cannot find attractive stocks to buy.
He prefers to wait until bargains crop up.
''To me it's a very common-sensical approach,'' Mr. Schoelzel said.
''The key is to have balance -- not to own stocks of just one particular sector, but to look at five or six areas that generally offer the most dynamic prospects for growth.''
Not surprisingly, investors have been throwing money at the Janus Twenty fund, even as they turned tail and ran away from stock funds as a whole in August.
In that regard, investors abandoned the mantra they have have chanted for the last three years -- ''Where else is there to put money than in stocks?''
The cloud hanging over the fund business represents a startling change from the environment at the end of the second quarter, when a fourth consecutive year of 20-plus percent gains seemed likely for equity investors.
Bond funds, too, had registered gains, averaging nearly 3.5 percent.
But by losing more than 13 percent of its value in the third quarter, the average American stock fund wiped out the previous two quarters of gains and then some.

For the last three years, with the markets marching steadily upwards, the industry trend had been to push fund managers into ever-narrower pigeonholes.
Fund companies increasingly cracked the asset-allocation whip, insisting that managers remain fully invested.
Yet the losses that many investors will face when they open their third-quarter statements later this month might have been smaller if fund managers had been given a bit more slack in how they managed their portfolios.
A fund manager who has some flexibility to decide when, as well as in which securities, to invest might give a fund shareholder a leg up in times of market upheaval.
''I'm happy to have some extra cash around,'' said Wallace R. Weitz, manager of the Weitz Value and Weitz Partners Value funds, which have had as much as one-quarter of their assets in cash this year.
Mr. Weitz knows of what he speaks.
He is the only manager with two of his equity funds among the top 10 performers over the last four quarters.
11.)
Mr. Weitz says he likes the spare cash ''because I always think that tomorrow I'll find a great idea.''
RESISTING the urge to pay too much for what are otherwise good companies and rigorously cutting back on holdings whose prices move up too far, too fast are two of the hardest disciplines for a portfolio manager to master.
And doing so is subverted in the current environment, as fund analysts and pension consultants demand that managers remain fully invested.
Enforcing that dogma probably hurt investors more than it helped them recently, because it has caused the amount of nonequity investments in most fund shareholders' portfolios to drift further and further down.
The amount of overall mutual fund assets in bonds has fallen over the last three-plus years to 17 percent of assets, from 31 percent at the beginning of 1995.
Over the same stretch, stocks have risen to 58 percent from 40 percent, while cash has remained relatively constant at about 25 percent of assets.
In the last few years, of course, fund companies have tried to help investors know what is in their portfolios.
But they have done so both by increasing their disclosure and by creating an enormous number of new, specialized funds, investing in specific niches.
Such specialization -- from Malaysian bonds to North American commercial real estate to stocks of companies working to solve the year-2000 problem -- creates inevitable problems for the fund industry, financial analysts say.
''I always get concerned when a fund group goes into so many areas at once, particularly when those areas are not linked to any particular ability that the fund company has,'' said Kurt Cerulli, a Boston fund consultant.

That has been the case for much of the fund industry in the last several years.
In trying to establish the breadth of product line needed to be considered for corporate 401(k) and other retirement programs, fund families have added funds that invest in obscure overseas markets, funds that specialize in various industries and portfolios that spread assets across all types of financial securities.
The strategy also helps fund companies by increasing the chance that at least one of their funds will land in the upper ranks of the performance tables, drawing attention and new investors.
But rather than being seduced by such variety, an investor may be able to improve performance by looking for a company that has funds in just a few categories, and that performs admirably in them.

''I think if a fund company doesn't have a deep expertise in a particular area, it doesn't have any business offering a product to the public in that area,'' Mr. Cerulli said.
''You may hire a manager with expertise in that area, but if as a company you don't have that depth, how do you tell when a manager is straying into areas where he shouldn't be?''
The problem, Mr. Cerulli said, is that the most esoteric investment areas also carry the most risk.
So when a downturn comes, liquidity dries up quickly, making losses worse.
Mr. Cerulli said that if those more obscure types of funds do not perform well, fund companies are right to shut them down.
As emerging markets have crumbled around the world, investors have fled from many of those funds.
In the last several weeks, as their assets have dropped to levels that make the funds unprofitable to operate, at least a half-dozen Asian and emerging-market funds have announced plans to liquidate or be merged into larger funds.
And after getting off to a similarly poor start in the first half of this year, Mr. DiCarlo stepped down.
Mr. DiCarlo could not be reached for comment last week.
When he stepped down from the John Hancock fund, he said in a news release: ''The performance of the target universe of the fund has been disappointing over the last two years, as has the fund's performance.
Still, I am very appreciative to have served on behalf of all those involved with Special Equities fund.''

And Paul Stephens, chief investment officer for the Robertson Stephens mutual funds and manager of the high-profile Robertson Stephens Contrarian fund, gave up some of his duties last month after a similarly prolonged slide.
While he remains at the fund, he now shares managerial duties with two colleagues, Andrew P. Pilara Jr. and Roderick R. Berry.
The Contrarian fund aims to buy out-of-favor investments that will perform well when the current favorites run cold; instead, even the worst-performing general stock funds in this year's market slide had to sprint to beat it to the bottom of the rankings.
After one of the best performances among world stock funds in 1995 and 1996, the Contrarian fund lost 30 percent last year and 37 percent in the first nine months of 1998 -- leaving it with cumulative losses of roughly 20 percent since the fund's inception in June 1993.
Mr. Stephens did not return a phone call seeking comment.
But Mr. Pilara said that while the fund has not changed its strategy, the new managers ''will give us a greater breadth of sectors and ideas'' from which to choose investments.
THAT such dismal performances can last so long usually means that more went against a manager than just his investment style going out of favor.
Something else also falters -- his stock-picking, his expectation of which way interest rates will go or the like.
But out of such extended periods of dismal performance, opportunities are born.
It is hard to believe, for example, that there are no hidden gems among small-cap stocks, which have far underperformed the large stocks that have benefited from equity investors' recent flight to quality.
Mark A. Coffelt, manager of Texas Capital Value and Growth, certainly believes there are.
''When the psychology shifts, the place to be will be in small caps,'' Mr. Coffelt said.
''The valuations already are incredibly compressed.
Small caps are selling at 50 percent of the valuations of large-cap stocks.
I think we will be in a recession sometime in the next five years, and maybe we already are.
But at this stage I think that small stocks have already largely discounted that.''
In other words, the best opportunities might be in funds investors have all but ignored in the last year.
While Morningstar Inc. lists it as a diversified stock fund, the Securities and Exchange Commission classifies it as nondiversified.
To the Editor:

Re ''From Brazil's Perspective, a Bailout Shouldn't Have to Hurt'' (news article, Oct. 7): When Brazilians say they do not want a ''package,'' they are thinking of a series of arbitrary measures, some of dubious legality, put in place overnight to seek a quick solution to a serious problem.
These packages have included price and wage freezes and changes in the way interest rates, rents and taxes are calculated.
Such steps are vital with soaring inflation.
JAMES SINCLAIR

New York, Oct. 7, 1998
The new work builds on a well-established body of research pointing to calcium's complex role in the body.
Through the years, scientists have demonstrated that calcium is required for myriad body functions:

*Transmission of nerve impulses that control muscle contractions.
*Release of chemicals that carry messages between nerves.
*Binding together of cells to form organs.
*Production and activity of enzymes and hormones that regulate digestion, fat metabolism, energy release and saliva production.
*Clotting of the blood to initiate wound healing.
*Secretion of hormones and other substances from glands throughout the body.
*Chemical signaling within cells.
*Growth and maturation of lining cells throughout the body.
''It's not surprising that calcium plays so many roles,'' said Dr. Hector F. DeLuca, a biochemist at the University of Wisconsin who is an expert on vitamin D and calcium metabolism.
''Since all life originated in the sea in a bath containing calcium, we all developed systems that depend on it.''
This mechanism involves vitamin D. In its activated form as a hormone, vitamin D enables calcium to enter the blood through the intestinal wall and be incorporated into bone.
But if the body does not receive enough dietary calcium to maintain the needed blood level, parathyroid hormone leaps to the rescue.
Its job is to signal the release of calcium from the bones to restore a normal blood level of this life-sustaining mineral.
If the diet is chronically deficient in calcium (or vitamin D), as it is for as many as three-fourths of Americans, the bones gradually get weaker and weaker.
PMS and Bone Disease

A chronic deficiency or imbalance of calcium is what Dr. Susan Thys-Jacobs, a gynecologist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, believes is largely responsible for the disruptive symptoms of PMS suffered by as many as 40 percent of women.
In fact, Dr. Thys-Jacobs said, PMS may be a harbinger of osteoporosis, a warning that a woman is not getting enough calcium and, as a result, is constantly losing bone.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Buoyed by the promising results of a pilot study of calcium's ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms and menstrual pain, Dr. Thys-Jacobs and colleagues at 11 other medical centers enrolled nearly 500 women with debilitating PMS in a trial of calcium's ability to relieve their monthly discomfort.
Dr. Thys-Jacobs concluded that women with PMS might have a form of ''functional hypocalcemia'' -- calcium levels in their blood and urine are normal, but only because parathyroid hormone levels are abnormally high and the hormone is continually extracting calcium from their bones to replenish the blood's supply.
She suggested that all women with PMS be assessed for deficiencies of calcium and vitamin D, as indicated by their blood levels of parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D. She pointed out that ''80 percent of a person's vitamin D is made in the skin when exposed to sunlight, but a lot of young women are now avoiding the sun and using sunscreens.''

''Their vitamin D levels are very low,'' Dr. Thys-Jacobs ''and therefore they're not absorbing enough calcium from their diet even if they consume enough, which most young women do not.''
Effect on Cancers

Tissues throughout the body are lined with epithelial cells like the ones that form the outer layer of skin.
They grow, mature, slough off and are replaced by new ones.
In the lining of the colon, where cancers arise, the turnover of epithelial cells normally takes a week.
But in people prone to colon cancer, these cells fail to grow and mature normally and instead immature cells proliferate rapidly.
Studies in people and animals have linked high fat diets to colon cancer and shown that fatty acids and the bile acids released to process them are irritants that stimulate abnormal cell proliferation in the colon.
Dr. Martin Lipkin of the Strang Cancer Research Laboratory at Rockefeller University in New York described studies showing that calcium could bind tightly to these irritants and inhibit their ability to stimulate cell proliferation.
With calcium present, as it would be on a calcium-rich diet, the cells differentiate and mature like normal epithelial cells.
Dr. Lipkin and his colleagues showed that calcium supplements could inhibit colonic cell proliferation in people susceptible to colon cancer.

Regulating Blood Pressure

A person's blood pressure is influenced by many factors, including genetics, body weight, physical activity and, in some cases, salt intake.
But dozens of studies since the early 1980's have also implicated calcium as a potentially important contributor to normal blood pressure, especially the calcium found in dairy products.
The findings suggest that a low intake of calcium-rich dairy products may partly account for the high rates of hypertension among African-Americans.
A shortage of calcium might also contribute to the rise in blood pressure that commonly accompanies aging.
Even if calcium intake is adequate, which it usually is not, most older people are deficient in the active form of vitamin D needed to absorb calcium.
Though he was a co-author of the association's statement, which was published recently in the journal Circulation, Dr. David McCarron, a hypertension specialist at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, champions the view that calcium-rich milk products are more effective than a low-sodium diet in curbing hypertension.
Nearly half of Americans consume less than 450 milligrams of calcium a day, ''and it's getting worse,'' Dr. McCarron said.
His main concern now is the ''seriously deficient'' diet consumed by a very large proportion of American children.
Children, he said, are drinking soda and juices, not milk, and they rarely come close to eating the recommended five servings a day of fruits and vegetables.
He believes parents and schools are setting children up for a lifetime of ill health.
''Calcium is a lot more than simply bone health,'' Dr. McCarron concluded.
Correction: October 16, 1998, Friday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about calcium misidentified Dr. Susan Thys-Jacobs, a researcher at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York who links chronic calcium deficiency to the disruptive symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.
She is an endocrinologist, not a gynecologist.
Mr. Duisenberg's remarks, which came after a meeting of the bank's governing council, underline a growing divergence between monetary policy in Europe and the United States.
While the Federal Reserve has begun lowering American interest rates amid fear of a significant slowdown in the economy, the European bankers are barely flinching from their original course and remain preoccupied with establishing the new currency's credibility.

A surprising effect of that policy has been the strength of existing European currencies, like the German mark and the French franc, which essentially mirror expectations for the euro.
Traders, far from being skittish about an untested currency in the offing, have begun buying the current national currencies as a haven from global shocks in Asia, Latin America and Russia.
The mark and the franc are nearly 10 percent stronger against the dollar than they were in August.
In recent days, the European Central Bank has come under increasing pressure from national leaders to either reduce interest rates or support other measures to keep European growth from slipping.
In Germany, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroder has called for lower rates, and his designated finance minister has repeatedly assailed the German central bank's, and by extension the European bank's, tight-money policies as misguided.
The French Cabinet continues its complaints against those policies.

Most economists predict that growth in the so-called euro zone will remain above 2.5 percent through the end of 1998 but will substantially slow next year.
The continuing problems in Asia and Latin America are expected to curtail demand for European exports, and the recent shift in exchange rates will dig more deeply by making European exports more expensive in dollar terms.
Signs of slowing growth are already becoming apparent in Germany, where industrial exports have been the economic engine in the last 18 months.
Machine-tool and engineering companies have lowered their forecasts for exports next year.
Hoechst, the chemical and pharmaceutical giant, warned on Monday that its profits in the second half of this year would fall below those in the period a year earlier.
European banks are also reporting big setbacks and are eliminating thousands of jobs because of losses in securities trading, soured foreign loans and heightened competitive pressure.
In the last 10 days, the chairmen of two leading financial institutions -- UBS of Switzerland and ING Barings in the Netherlands -- have resigned in the wake of big losses.
Some analysts expect more bad news in the months ahead, predicting that banks will be forced to write off more foreign loans than they already have.
Mr. Duisenberg acknowledged that financial crises elsewhere would affect Europe.
''The number of signs suggesting that the world economy will slow down in 1999 is increasing,'' he said at a news conference here today.
But he insisted that ''proposals inspired by policy activism'' must be avoided.
''There are no signs of a credit crunch in Europe,'' he maintained.

The European Central Bank is still struggling with the tools it will use to set monetary policy, torn between basing it simply on the growth of the money supply or on inflation targets.
In principle, many central bankers would prefer to follow the example of the Bundesbank, which bases lending rates almost entirely on the growth of the German money supply.
In practice, money statistics vary considerably between countries in the new currency union, and new forms of financial transactions have further complicated the definitions of money.
After months of debate behind closed doors, Mr. Duisenberg announced that the bank would use both money supply and inflation targets.
The overall goal will be to keep inflation under 2 percent.
''The political pressure could increase -- I would not deny that,'' he said.
''But it is pressure against a strong institution.
We will make our own judgments, use our own analysis and reach our own decisions.''
AS the stock market lurches like an elevator out of control, a growing number of would-be apartment buyers are seeking to take advantage of the current uncertainty by making ''take it or leave it'' bargain-basement offers on co-ops and condominiums -- and getting nowhere, brokers say.
In the current market, where many apartments, especially the overpriced ones, have already come down a peg or two in price, brokers say that sellers are feeling squeezed by these bottom fishers.
''They've already reduced it, and that's where the insult comes,'' said Richard S. Orenstein, an agent at the Halstead Property Company.
Neil Binder, an owner of Bellmarc Realty, which has seven offices and 250 sales agents, said that his company's statistics show that apartments are now selling for prices that are 7 to 10 percent lower than they were in June.
But for some bidders, he added, that isn't enough of a reduction.
''The buyers are acting like the world is about to end and sellers should be happy to get anything for their apartment,'' Mr. Binder said.
''Well, it's no fire sale out there -- not with interest rates the lowest they've been in 30 years.''

No one questions the buyer's right to make a low-ball bid, but their problem is that sellers are rejecting the offers.
Not only that, she added, ''but we're seeing that even when deals fall through, negotiations with someone else begin quite quickly.''
But she agreed that, over all, apartment owners are becoming ''more reasonable'' and are negotiating more on prices, which she called a ''very desirable thing.''
He argued that there are many differences between then and now and that no one is sure the same kind of decline will occur.
''People are remembering that prices did drop,'' he said, ''but they're not remembering how long it took.''
Some would-be buyers are ''chumming the waters for spectacular fish, but they aren't catching any,'' Mr. Halstead said, continuing: ''They don't realize that we don't have a ticker tape in the real estate office.
People are nervous about the securities market, and they impute that shaky feeling to everything from pork bellies to houses.''
He also said that of all Manhattan's neighborhoods, those south of 23d Street, particularly Greenwich Village, TriBeCa and SoHo, have been least affected by nerves.
''Sales there continue unabated,'' he said.
''It's very chic, and the people buying there are leaders, not followers.''

''It's spotty everywhere,'' he said.
''It depends on who your buyer is.
The people who are financially secure, and know that real estate is a long-term choice, aren't anxious about whether they can save a few dollars by waiting a few weeks.
The people who are more anxious are people who are heavily in the stock market and regard real estate as more of an investment than a home.''
But Mr. Peters knows about offers that go straight for the jugular.
The listing price had just been reduced to $2,695,000, which is not a bad price for 3,200 square feet.
The man made what agents call a very aggressive bid: $2.5 million.
''What do you think the seller did?''
Acting on his own authority after consulting by telephone with members of the Fed's policy-making committee, Alan Greenspan, the chairman, reduced the Federal funds target for the overnight lending rate between banks by a quarter-point, to 5 percent.
The cut was intended to encourage more lending and to bolster the economy by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow.

The central bank's board also approved a quarter-point reduction in the discount rate on loans from the Federal Reserve to banks.
''Growing caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally are likely to be restraining aggregate demand in the future,'' the Federal Reserve said in a statement, referring to the likelihood of a slowdown.
Several banks quickly reduced their prime rates on loans to their best customers, setting off a cycle that could lead to slightly lower rates on credit cards, auto loans and other loans to consumers.
While the Federal Reserve's action does not directly affect mortgage rates, which have been creeping up from very low levels, it could help push them back down by putting pressure on the long-term rates set in the bond market.
The interest rate cut sent stock prices soaring around the world.
The dollar, which has been sliding sharply against the Japanese yen, fell again.
The markets have been especially skittish since the near-collapse last month of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., the prominent hedge fund.
''Whenever the Fed does something out of the ordinary, it makes you wonder, and the first thing that comes to mind is whether there is some other financial market land mine out there,'' said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
''Obviously they felt a need to move that couldn't wait a month.
It's a bit of a mystery.''

There were no immediate signs of any bank or investment firm running into deep trouble.
But Mr. Greenspan and other policy makers in Washington have been fretting in public for the last week about how the crisis of confidence has affected even the safest haven, the market for United States Treasury securities.

For the last several months, investors worldwide have been dumping stocks and bonds almost indiscriminately and putting their money into Treasury bonds.
But in recent weeks economists have noticed that within the Treasury market investors are increasingly buying only the newest issues, which tend to trade most readily, and avoiding older issues, for which there is a less liquid market.
As Mr. Greenspan pointed out in a speech last week, investors are therefore demanding not just safety in their investments but the ability to sell them instantaneously.
The development was a troublesome sign, Mr. Greenspan suggested, because companies are already having trouble raising money in the stock and bond markets and banks are showing signs of pulling back on new lending.
If their access to money dried up, businesses would have to cut back on their investments in new technology and equipment, which have driven much of the economy's growth in recent years.
''What is now a Wall Street problem threatened to become a Main Street problem.
What the Fed is doing now makes me less pessimistic about the risks next year.''
In moving today, more than a month before the next scheduled Fed meeting on Nov. 17, Mr. Greenspan again asserted his power at the Fed, sweeping aside any remaining objections from colleagues who think rate cuts could backfire if the economy proves more resilient than it appears.
It is unclear whether Mr. Greenspan had specifically requested the authority from the policy-making committee to cut rates another quarter-point before the next meeting.
Mr. Greenspan had room to move, though, precisely because there have been so few signs of inflation in the economy.

The Federal Reserve's action came against a backdrop of efforts by policy makers around the world to bring the financial crisis under control.
Japan took a big step this week toward addressing the problems that have paralyzed its banking system, agreeing on a plan to spend up to $500 billion to shore up ailing institutions.
And today, Congress came to a final agreement with the Clinton Administration on new money for the International Monetary Fund, which is assembling a package of financial aid for Brazil.
Pressure is growing on Germany's powerful central bank to consider a rate cut; Britain and Spain have both cut rates in the last week.
Some analysts said the rate cuts by the Fed would not have as powerful a stimulative effect on the domestic economy as they would under normal circumstances.
That is because the long-term rates set in the markets are already relatively low and the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing, are already booming.
The fall in the dollar, they said, would help make American goods somewhat more competitive on international markets, giving a slight boost to the economy.
And to the extent that the weakening dollar increases the relative value of the yen, it will help inject more confidence into the moribund Japanese economy and avert further devaluations by other Asian countries.

The Federal Reserve's move last week to shave a quarter of a point from interest rates may not be the only thing going for the stock market for the remainder of the year.
While the 10.3 percent fall in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the third quarter was the seventh-worst for all the third quarters since World War II, that may actually portend some good news.
In that same issue of the newsletter, David Blitzer, chief economist of S.& P., made the prescient call that the Fed would continue to ease credit.
Dr. Blitzer sees opportunities ahead.
The Fed will ease rates by a further three-quarters of a percentage point by mid-1999, he predicted.
He also believes that by January, European monetary authorities ''will see the European version of what the Fed sees -- a credit crunch and no inflation,'' so they, too, will lower rates, giving more fuel to the global recovery.
Financial service stocks should be strong performers, he said, rebounding from the beating they have taken lately.
JAN M. ROSEN
DOLLAR DECLINES.
The dollar fell against the yen for a fourth consecutive session on expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates a third time this year.
Those who prefer more complex race cars can choose from two series for Indy cars, which are slightly lower-tech versions of Formula One.

Nevertheless, Formula One's appeal in the United States should not be dismissed -- not before taking a drive alongside the Pacific in Newport Beach, Calif., at 5 A.M. on a Sunday during a Grand Prix weekend.
That's when you will see about 150 people waiting to get into the Speedway International Racing Bistro and Bar.
Think of it as a Planet Hollywood with 200-mile-an-hour decor.
Grand Prix fans commune here at that ungodly hour -- a full 60 minutes before Bloody Marys can be legally served -- for the live Formula One telecasts from Europe shown on the Speedvision cable network.
''We have a huge, huge interest in this thing,'' said one of the restaurant's owners, Nick Costa.
''They scream and yell during the races.''
Mr. Costa estimates that only 20 percent of his clientele are expatriates looking for a Grand Prix fix.
If negotiations work out, the United States Grand Prix could return in 2000 at a new track inside the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
A group in Dallas has also expressed interest in a grand prix, but the Speedway's desire -- and pockets -- are deep enough to land the race.
ANY American track owner willing to pay the $10 million to $15 million generally thought necessary to acquire rights to a Formula One race will probably need to multiply the Speedway Bistro crowd by a factor of 1,000 to be successful.
That's because Formula One officials will also demand costly safety improvements (like extensive runoff areas in the turns with gravel pits as carefully raked as a Japanese garden) and other amenities (like pit-side garages with corporate suites on top) that no United States sanctioning group requires.
And unlike Nascar, Formula One -- the name given to the set of rules that defines the most technically advanced race cars -- does not share its fees from broadcasting rights with track owners.
''The problem with holding a Grand Prix in the United States is cost,'' said Roger Werner, the founder and president of Speedvision.
''The series is the ultimate in motor sports.
It is also the most expensive, not surprisingly.
So to bring the show to town, it's a big, big number.
And most private promoters have a hard time making that equation work.''
IT is even harder when you are competing with big spenders like the Malaysian and Chinese Governments, which are ready to pay whatever it takes to become one of only 16 countries granted a Formula One race annually.
Based on ticket prices at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, American fans can expect to pay $100 or more for a seat at any future United States Grand Prix.

''I think there is room for one, and I think there is a demand for one,'' said Danny Sullivan, the 1985 Indy 500 winner, who drove a Formula One car in 1983.
''But I hope any United States Grand Prix gets put in one venue and stays there.''
In many countries, the Formula One race is synonymous with one track: Monza in Italy, for example.
In retrospect, the West Coast race -- a glamorous event that was the Pacific Coast's equivalent of the Monaco Grand Prix -- may have been the undoing of the East Coast race.
A similar fate befell the Detroit Grand Prix in 1988, after six years.
The 90's have seen Nascar become the American brand of racing; according to the annual racing-attendance survey by Goodyear, the Winston Cup drew an average of 190,355 fans per event in 1997.
''In Italy or other countries, their Grand Prix is the biggest race of the year,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
''But over here, besides Nascar, we have CART and the Indy Racing League in Indy-car racing.''
Besides competing for fans, these American series snatch up talented young American drivers who, like Mr. Sullivan, used to go to Europe to start their careers.
''In Europe, they're not that keen on American drivers because they haven't proved themselves over the years,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
''And that's because American drivers have plenty of opportunities over here.''

THE last American to race on the Formula One tour was Michael Andretti, son of the 1978 Formula One champion Mario Andretti.
2 driver behind the great Ayrton Senna of Brazil -- the equivalent of playing behind Cal Ripken Jr. And that, his father says, demonstrates another reason young Americans like Jeff Gordon, the Nascar star, don't want to try Formula One.
''The lure isn't there,'' Mario Andretti said, ''because in Formula One, unless you're with one of the top three teams, you'll never get to show your talents.''
Mr. Sullivan said that having an American Formula One driver would certainly help a future United States Grand Prix.
''We're all the same,'' he said.
''We want to root for our nationality competing against other nationalities.
''So New York is a big market,'' he said.
''Boston's a big market, L.A. -- and Miami, of course, because you have a lot of South Americans and it's a very big sport on that continent.''
It is this audience that must help Formula One regain a beachhead in the United States.
Nascar's TV ratings, which take a back seat only to the National Football League and the baseball playoffs, are particularly strong in rural areas.
Asking stock-car fans to acquire a taste for Formula One may be like asking a Bud drinker to start sipping Campari.
Then again, this is the land that new Ferraris call home more than any other.
''Anyone who says U.S. racing fans don't care about Formula One is completely wrong,'' Mario Andretti said.
''It's the same people who say American drivers can't cut it.''
''It doesn't do us any good to receive products,'' said Mr. Silveira, whose family scrapes by on his $300 a month, and on the sewing his wife takes in.

That's what the company is supposed to do.''

Joseph Couri, president of the Association of Small Industries in Sao Paulo, said that with access to credit shrinking, companies might not have much choice but to pay workers in products instead of cash at the end of the year.
''It's a real possibility,'' he said, ''because the financial system is highly selective, interest rates are high and there's a great difficulty in gaining access to credit.''
The 13th month's salary is not a bonus, but a legally mandated payment due all workers.
Employers pay salaries on a monthly basis in Brazil, but because the payments cover four weeks, the 13th payment at the end of the year compensates for the extra days each month.
Brazil's plight is not nearly as severe as Russia's, where the trade in, say, shoes for shirts, has replaced cash as the dominant form of commerce in parts of the country.
And in contrast to Russia, barter is being proposed only for the 13th-month payment, not for full salaries.
Political leaders here are poised to announce a $20 billion austerity package that should bring down spending and raise revenue.
The Government retains good relations with an array of international lending agencies led by the International Monetary Fund, which has promised a package of aid for Brazil that will probably total around $30 billion.
But with two rounds of national elections this month, the Government has delayed spelling out the painful measures it must use to bring Brazil in from the financial brink, and the nation's financial position remains shaky.
This week, J. P. Morgan ranked Brazil the fourth-riskiest country for doing business, after Russia, Indonesia and Ecuador -- all of which have devalued currencies or defaulted on foreign debt.
''Everybody needs to think about how to survive,'' said Roberto Faldini, a board member of the Industrial Federation of Sao Paulo.
''It's a possible solution to the lack of money for the company and the workers.''
Brazilian officials, led by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, have held fast to a commitment not to devalue the currency, the real, which means royal in Portuguese.
Officials in Brasilia, the capital, argue that the country's exchange-rate policy, which allows the currency to gradually fall in value around 7.5 percent a year within an exchange-rate band, allows flexibility without instability.
They insist that any devaluation, given Brazil's history, would bring back indexing and hyperinflation.

''To think Brazil can have 10 percent inflation and it will stop there is completely wrong,'' said Demosthenes Madureira do Pinho, head of international relations at the central bank.
Economists who propose a policy permitting moderate inflation, notably Rudiger Dornbush of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, are off, Mr. Pinho argues.
''What they're saying is: 'I don't know that country's reality.
I don't know anything about Brazil,' '' Mr. Pinho said.

But an important consequence of the decision not to formally devalue is a recession that is hitting Sao Paulo especially hard.
Without devaluing, the Government had to raise the ceiling on interbank loan rates to 50 percent to defend the currency, choking off credit for industrial expansion.
Business loans, available only to the most creditworthy, are running 40 to 50 percent a year, while consumer lending rates exceed 120 percent.
The overvalued currency is shrinking the market for exports.
The current account deficit, a broad gauge of trade in goods and services, is running at 4 percent of the gross national product, or $32 billion.
And, Mr. Couri said, the Government appears to be relying on raising taxes, including those on businesses and financial transactions, to make up a substantial portion of the $20 billion it must save next year to win I.M.F.
backing.
''It's the same as raising the cost of credit for banks, and consequently the same as raising interest rates,'' he said.
''It runs exactly counter to what we need.''
He said individual companies were reluctant to speak openly of the difficulties that are pushing them to consider paying workers with goods.
Doing so, they fear, would undermine their standing with creditors and clients.
Mr. Faldini of the industrial federation said companies would work out barter agreements case by case with workers and unions, perhaps offering only partial payment in goods.
He described barter as a way of meeting obligations to workers, instead of not paying them, and said it would probably be tried in consumer-goods industries like textiles, food and toys, adding: ''Instead of sending them to court to receive what they need to receive in three or four years, there are some companies that said, 'Well, I don't have money.
I know I have to pay the 13th salary, and maybe I cannot sell my merchandise because of crisis.
Why not make an agreement that I would pay part in goods and part in money?'
''

Unemployment is running at 19 percent in the Sao Paulo area and 8 percent nationally, with some economists predicting an increase half that again in national unemployment.
Workers see the barter proposal as the harbinger of worse times to come.
''It's the situation of the country that's in crisis,'' Mr. Silveira, the glove maker, said.
Labor unions have already granted broad concessions in an effort to avoid layoffs.
At car and appliance factories, workers have agreed to collective vacations and to staying home when they are not needed on the factory floor, making up the time when demand picks up.
But they say that passing up a month's salary, or receiving it in screwdrivers or shoes, is beyond the limit.
''The companies always take out whatever problems they're having on the workers.''
Claudio de Souza, 25, who sells stereo equipment and television sets at the Mappin department store here, said he would not mind taking his 13th month in goods.

But others, like Mr. Silveira, worry about ending the year shortchanged.
In the last four years, business at his factory, which makes industrial gloves for metal workers, has dropped 40 percent.
The work force has shrunk to 5 from 11.
''We could lose our jobs because of this crisis,'' he said.
He was on the bench from 1966 to 1973, carrying on after suffering two strokes in the late 1960's.
While serving in the Chancery Division in Morris County, his thorough oral and written decisions took on statewide and national significance, particularly in his final years on the bench.
He handled ''novel impression'' cases with no clear legal precedents to guide him, touching on social issues like religion in the classroom, airport noise and sex education.
His most celebrated case involved the school board of Netcong, N.J., which had a policy providing for daily school readings of prayers published regularly in the Congressional Record, as delivered by Congressional chaplains at the start of the day.

By discounting ''beautiful prayers'' as ''remarks,'' the board tried to ''peddle religion in a very cheap manner under an assumed name,'' he wrote, adding, ''This type of subterfuge is degrading to all religions.''
''Perhaps the time has arrived,'' he wrote, ''when the giants of industry will see the wisdom of slowing the cross-country speed of their important executives, and will take a close, concerned look at the little people of this country.''

After retiring to Connecticut, Judge Stamler developed a statewide program for youthful first offenders, some still in their pre-teens, to teach them respect for the law.
It let them learn by playing the roles of lawyers, judges, jurors and other court figures in moot cases.
The bar association conducts it as part of its efforts to inform people how their judicial system works.
He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Lillian Spitzer Stamler; two sons, Joseph Jr., of Fairfield, Conn., and S. Paul, of Stony Creek, Conn., and four grandchildren.
In 10 buildings that Mr. Walentas owns, with 2 million square feet of space, are high-end apartments, artists' studios, offices, factories and storerooms.
His vision -- by no means universally shared or admired -- is to supplement these with a waterfront entertainment, retail and recreation center, largely for Brooklyn residents, with a marina, a historic carousel, movie theaters, a hotel, many stores and plenty of parking in multilevel garages.

Like any precinct in transition, Dumbo shows different facets to different viewers.
A newcomer might see it as raw, stark, desolate; a Depression-era Berenice Abbott photograph come to life, with a faintly sinister quality that is more than just imagined.
Those who know the area see something else: joggers, artists, dog-walkers, parents taking children to school -- the seeds of a neighborhood.
''One day, it's all heavy machinery and trucks,'' said Ivan Schwartz, who has worked in the area since 1985.
''The next day, there are happenings and Europeans with cameras.''
That may be just the start.
Two Trees Development, which David Walentas owns, has applied for the rezoning of five more blocks, has been conditionally designated as the developer of a city-owned waterfront lot north of the Gair complex and was the only respondent to a request for proposals for the adaptive reuse of the nearby Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park.
Jed Walentas, who is managing the project for his father, likened the broader redevelopment to Harborplace in Baltimore.
''Brooklyn is a huge middle-class city with very few activities for middle-class families,'' he said.
Opponents see a forest of problems in Two Trees, believing that the company will commercialize and privatize the waterfront, flood the surrounding area with automobile traffic, deplete what little open space remains and create a social, economic and physical barrier between a precious segment of shoreline and less affluent neighborhoods like Vinegar Hill.
Mr. Walentas will face political obstacles no matter what he does.
But in at least one respect, his prospects may be brighter than ever.
Although he was anathema at City Hall during Edward I. Koch's mayoralty -- purely for personal reasons, he asserts -- Mr. Walentas has found a warmer reception from the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, even if it falls short of an unreserved embrace.
''There are a lot of people who are opposed to anything and some of them live in the Down Under area,'' said Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation (who dislikes the name Dumbo).
''But the reality is that while there may be some specific flaws in this plan, it's going to create investment and jobs in New York.''
Joseph B.
''It's a great opportunity to develop an exciting piece of waterfront,'' he said, but it ''has to balance a complex set of economic, transportation and land-use planning questions.''

''We're definitely sympathetic to the goal,'' he said.
''It allows for the emergence of additional SoHos and TriBeCas.''
The rezoning allowed Mr. Walentas to convert the 16-story factory at 1 Main Street into a 124-unit condominium loft building that is now called the Clock Tower.
But the measure was endorsed by Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn, who was described by his chief of staff, Greg Brooks, as being ''very pleased to see that the change in zoning created the impetus for the Clock Tower, which is upscale housing, something that the borough really needs.''
AND Mr. Millard said: ''We have already learned the folly of trying to save manufacturing-only zoning in places where people would otherwise be willing to make a serious investment.''
Serious, indeed.
The Clock Tower conversion was designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, which is also planning the more ambitious development.
Best known for the renovation of Grand Central Terminal, Beyer Blinder Belle has worked for Mr. Walentas since the mid-70's, rehabilitating hundreds of modest housing units, including the Kew Gardens Hills project in Queens; renovating the landmark Alwyn Court Apartments at 182 West 58th Street and converting the Silk Building, 692 Broadway, at East Fourth Street, into lofts.

Apartments in the Clock Tower range from one to three bedrooms and in price from $300,000 to more than $1 million (on average, about $300 a square foot).
For $4 million, a buyer with more imagination than budgetary restraints can pick up the clock loft, a raw space of 3,500 square feet with 25-foot-high ceilings and four see-through clock faces, 15 feet in diameter.
Mr. Walentas and his wife, Jane, plan to move into the unit immediately below the clock loft, which also commands unobstructed views to every point on the compass.
''Our life revolves around Dumbo so we thought, 'Why not?'
Mrs. Walentas, an art director who holds a master's degree in fine arts, has been involved in the furnishing and design of the Clock Tower apartments.
But purchases have started to slow.
''I don't know whether that's because it's later in the year, or because of the market turmoil or because the units that are left are the larger family units,'' he said.
The application that is now under review would create a special mixed-use zoning district for five blocks on which seven of Mr. Walentas's buildings stand.
This would permit residential use in addition to the light manufacturing, warehousing, offices and studios that are now allowed.
Mr. Walentas would convert two vacant buildings, probably into rental apartments: 75 Washington Street, at York Street, and 66 Water Street, near Main Street.
Because his broader redevelopment project involves city- and state-owned land, it will be subject to many approvals.

''There is almost nothing it doesn't need,'' said Raymond H. Levin, of Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding, the lawyers for Two Trees.
''Mappings, de-mappings, garage special permits, rezonings, zoning text changes, Landmarks, Corps of Engineers, Department of Environmental Conservation.
There will be numerous opportunities for public review, comment and input.''
And no one expects the residents of Brooklyn Heights, Fulton Ferry, Dumbo, Vinegar Hill and Bridge Plaza to be shy in expressing objections.
Already, several community-based plans have been drawn up.
The Old Brooklyn Waterfront Alliance, which was formed last year, has called for ''greenspace'' from the Empire-Fulton Ferry park to a point one block north of the Manhattan Bridge.
Mr. Walentas said his plan would expand parkland.
''Instead of a three-acre park,'' he said, ''we'll have eight or nine acres of park, with a boardwalk that runs three-quarters of a mile.''
But that amenity comes at a price: the commercial development of the surroundings, including a city-owned parking lot on Plymouth Street that neighbors would also like to see as a park.
On that lot, stretching out to pilings in the East River, Mr. Walentas would build the Main Street Pier Building, envisioned as a 350,000-square-foot structure including a 150-room hotel, five to six stories high; a movie theater with 12 to 16 screens and 60,000 square feet of shops and restaurants.
More shops and restaurants, perhaps 250,000 square feet in all, would go into the Empire Stores, an abandoned warehouse on Water Street, between Dock and Main Streets, that looks almost medieval, with its solemn ranks of round-arched doorways and windows, some sealed by iron shutters.
Beans still litter the floors.
The Empire Stores is in the Empire-Fulton Ferry park and the city-designated Fulton Ferry Historic District.

Besides redeveloping the Empire Stores, Mr. Walentas would extend the park up to 50 feet, to the pierhead line.
At the water's edge, he would install a historic 1922 carousel from Idora Park in Youngstown, Ohio, with 48 wooden horses and 2 chariots.

Mr. Walentas is seeking a 49-year lease on the property, rather than the customary 20-year concession term, which would require the approval of the State Legislature.
A spokesman for the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Joseph A. Picchi, said last week that ''negotiations are still going on.''
Neighbors are far less enamored of the redevelopment plan.
''Everybody locally is in favor of a park,'' said Richard Brachman, an artist and member of the waterfront alliance, ''yet this regional shopping destination is still seriously being considered.''
A plan drawn up in May by the Community Board's land-use committee recommended that the waterfront be ''devoted to the maximum extent possible to open space, park and recreational opportunities open to the public and accessible to all, including lower-income members of the community.''
''There is no lack of opportunity for people in Brooklyn to find a place to spend money,'' said Paul DiLeo, chairman of the waterfront subcommittee of Community Board 2.
''However, there are not many places where you can go and not be confronted with a commercial environment.''
No less controversial is Mr. Walentas's proposal to build a 1,200-space parking garage under the Brooklyn Bridge and a 1,300-space garage under the Manhattan Bridge.
''For all this to work, you need parking,'' he said.
''Our plan is to put parking where nobody wants to be anyway.''

That is not how Doreen Gallo sees it.
''Do you want parking there or a park?''
''The closer to the waterfront you get, the more openness there should be.''
Ms. Gallo, an artist and member of the steering committee of the Dumbo Neighborhood Association, said she takes her 17-month-old daughter, Giovanna, to Empire-Fulton Ferry park every day.
Mr. Walentas also hopes to tear down a 1936 warehouse known as the Purchase Building, 11 Water Street, in the historic district.
Because no demolition application has reached the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the chairwoman, Jennifer J. Raab, declined to discuss the matter.
Razing the building, Mr. Walentas said, would open an extraordinary vista from Old Fulton Street to the Williamsburg Bridge in the distance.
''No one will believe the view,'' he said.
''We're talking about a $300 million project and this is the front door.''
IT is also a long way from his first investment, 30 years ago, in a five-story apartment building at Manhattan Avenue and 104th Street.
Then he began looking for other opportunities.
''I always believe in following the artists,'' he said.
Mr. Walentas cannot recall exactly who suggested the manufacturing lofts between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges.
But he does remember the day he first visited the site.
''He erected, one after another, the massive monolithic concrete buildings which now compose 'Gairville,' the most modern and thoroughly fireproof structures as yet known,'' Bonner wrote.

There followed what Peter J. Johnson, a state development official at the time, called ''an epic of Marx Brothers proportions, without the comic ending.''
Majestic pays $3 a square foot annually for 20,000 square feet.
Sam and Bala Silver founded the company in 1965 and it is continued today by their son, Moses.
Majestic employs 30 workers to make men's and boys' all-weather coats with zip-out linings, long dress coats, pea coats and suede-collar jackets.
''This is a dying trade in New York City, this kind of manufacturing,'' Mr. Silver said frankly.
It is not a business he expects to hand over to any of his nine children.
''None are interested,'' he said.
That is not to say that manufacturing has disappeared from Gairville, only that it is growing more in synch with the times.

In the workshop now are figures of Diana Ross and the Supremes, bound for the Motown Cafe in Orlando, Fla., and the Martha Stewart holiday window displays for Sony Plaza on Madison Avenue, at 55th Street.
Unlike Ms. Stewart's recipes, the Schwartz brothers' cakes are made of auto-body putty and chopped up Styrofoam.
Having moved to Dumbo from the West Village in 1985, Ivan Schwartz confesses to mixed feelings about the transformation of this ''end-of-the-world spot.''

''On the other hand, all it takes is a certain investment, a Walentas kind of spirit and before too long we'll see restaurants.''
The biggest role in the rescue program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund, which said this week that it would contribute at least $15 billion -- and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even more.
Another $9 billion or so will come from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and the remainder from the United States and other major industrial nations.

Germany and Japan, though, have been reluctant to take part, one American official noted, suggesting that Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own.
So far, American officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for a direct contribution to Brazil.
''Brazil is very important to the economic well-being of the region, the United States and the international community, and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful,'' Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said on Friday.
and the World Bank here three weeks ago.
At the time, Mr. Clinton argued the fund should ''provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion'' rather than wait for disaster to strike.
Direct American aid to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc -- not only for Brazil, but to stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico and other countries that are major American trading partners.
That would be a change of strategy.
So far, the United States has operated almost entirely through international financial institutions, chiefly the I.M.F.
But it would also be a risky move for President Clinton, economically and politically.
Other Administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in Congress to direct American participation in a Brazil bailout.

''I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared to death by what's been happening in the markets, and what could happen in their own districts,'' a White House official said this week, ''and they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it.''
By acting soon to stabilize Latin America, the Administration is hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer panic that engulfed Russia and, at its height, led to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from Brazil, for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue its currency.
Whether this calm marks the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires that have erupted since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 is a matter of considerable debate.
But many experts cite the confluence of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the world: two successive interest rate cuts in the United States, Japan's long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing to return.

Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly on markets, Mr. Rubin acknowledged that ''in the last several weeks there have been a number of significant, positive developments.''
But the former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market rallies, warned that ''serious issues remain'' and that ''it will take some time for the world to work its way out'' of what he has repeatedly called ''the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 years.''
In fact, Mr. Rubin's aides are clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic, which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market countries to borrow money on world markets.
''In Brazil, the issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem.
And in Japan the question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the money.''
But after spending 18 months in frustrating negotiations with the Japanese, Mr. Rubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in Tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not lack of resources.
In Brazil, though, the United States has a better chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program, as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Mr. Cardoso and his team.
But demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt Administration to help stabilize the dollar.
The money is under Mr. Rubin's control, with Presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent Congressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995.

But the reaction was so strong -- for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts -- that Mr. Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since.
So far, Brazilian officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the I.M.F., convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against the country.
But at the same time, the Brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash -- and are certainly in no hurry to get it.
American officials and top officials of the I.M.F.
are clearly nervous, worried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater the risk that Brazil will be caught in another round of market turmoil.
''The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control,'' said an investment banker involved in the talks.
''But the fact is that there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months the Government is going to be forced to devalue'' its currency, which is pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a carefully controlled fall.
To prevent a sudden devaluation, the Brazilian Government has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent, choking off credit for most companies.
Meanwhile, the country is slipping into recession.
The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it is contingent on Mr. Cardoso's success in persuading the legislature to end huge deficits, chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending.
The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's austerity plan, expected to be announced after Sunday's elections but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that the global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil.
''Brazil has to do a lot,'' Mr. Fischer said last week before leaving on his trip.
''In return, I expect the international community will make a large contribution.''
As Japan struggles to revive its economy and avert a global recession, it is under enormous pressure to make itself more efficient and thus stimulate a new burst of economic growth.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But it finds itself profoundly torn, for efficiency would come at the price of egalitarianism and other values that many Japanese regard as at least as important as economic growth.
''Nowadays, everybody calls for reforms and efficiency,'' said Tomishige Yazaki, Daiki's principal.
''But if we just pursue efficiency, the world would become a very dry place, with no sensitivity.''
Japan is often denounced as recalcitrant and paralyzed as its economy sinks into its worst recession in six decades, and it is true that Japanese leaders have spent years denying the existence of economic nettles instead of grasping them.
But in some respects this is a principled paralysis.
Japan's economic catastrophe has harmed all of Asia and arises largely from political incompetence, endemic corruption, webs of relationships that misallocate resources and a parliamentary system that hugely over-represents the most backward parts of the country.
Some of Japan's most serious delays, such as confronting its bad debts and banking instability, have involved more paralysis than principle.
Yet while everyone around the globe is complaining about how bad Japan is, in other respects the problem is that it has been too good.
Economists have long known of the ''paradox of thrift,'' which states that although it is admirable to save, a country that saves too much ends up hurting itself.
That is one of Japan's ailments, but more broadly it is being pummeled by what might be called a ''paradox of virtue.''
The economy is in deep recession in part for reasons that, in an old-fashioned way, seem honorable: a passion for prudent fiscal planning, for stamping out inflation, for saving for the future and perhaps most important of all, concern for the human flotsam of capitalism and for equality for all citizens.
Fiscal Nightmare: Recklessness Urged

Japan's commitment to equality is intricately linked in at least two ways to its economic crisis -- and the world's.
First, it is producing a welfare state for the inefficient, leading to a growing misallocation of resources in the world's second-largest economy.

Second, the impulse to improve the quality of life in remote areas by building tiny schools and countless mountain roads has helped send costs spiraling out of control.
Soaring budget deficits and concern about how to pay for the retirement of Japan's baby boomers led the Government to raise taxes last year.
But even if its timing was catastrophic, Japan was trying to do what economists believe is in principle the right thing: reduce budget deficits and plan for the aging of the baby-boom generation.
All industrialized countries face this challenge but most have put off the hard decisions, while Japan's leaders last year ignored its economic weakness and confronted the problem by raising taxes.
The stock market is at a 12-year low, and Japan's biggest banks -- eight of which have assets worth as much as the entire Russian gross national product -- are wobbling.
''Japan has found itself in the position of fighting the last major economic war, the Great Depression,'' said Adam S. Posen, a scholar at the Institute for International Economics in Washington and author of a new book on Japan's economy.
''And its Government has chosen to pursue the strategy that lost that war.''
Mr. Posen and many other economists here and abroad recommend a gigantic fiscal stimulus, such as a huge new spending program coupled with tax cuts.
Japan has reluctantly taken steps in that direction, but it has dithered because huge spending increases seem so, well, irresponsible.
Japan finds itself hampered as well in its monetary policy, because in the past it attacked inflation so relentlessly that interest rates are extremely low.
That makes it difficult to ease monetary policy by lowering rates further, and so some experts are urging Japan to get out of this box by pledging to be irresponsible and taking steps to nurture inflation.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The upshot is that for a diligent, serious nation like Japan, the present economic crisis is a nightmare: it is being scolded on all sides and advised that it must be more fiscally reckless and monetarily irresponsible.
A fiscal or monetary stimulus may rescue Japan in the short run, but most economists here and abroad say that in the longer term Japan must restructure its economy and pay much more attention to efficiency rather than equality.
Yet the calls for efficiency run smack into the egalitarianism that has been a national ideology since the end of World War II, when a defeated Japan was told of the evils of its traditions of authoritarianism and hierarchy.

Many economists and business leaders say that an obsession with equality is stifling Japan.
Inefficiencies And Bureaucracies

Take the Government's building projects.
They are partly a way of showing thanks to construction companies, which contribute mightily to the Liberal Democrats.
Yet such projects also seem to reflect an egalitarian commitment to improve the lives of people in remote areas.
On Ikarajima, a sleepy little islet in southern Japan that is home to only 350 people, a dazzling new $125 million steel bridge rises like a mirage, to connect one end of the island with a neighboring island.
That led to some sniping about waste of money, and so plans for a $250 million bridge on the other side of Ikarajima have been put on hold for now.
''The island people have been eagerly waiting for this new bridge, but now because of reports of waste, they are deprived even of their dreams,'' said Kenzo Uehara, a town official on the island.
''I don't know that you can criticize these projects just by the logic of numbers.''
One of the most breathtaking economic inefficiencies is the expenditure on tiny schools with just a handful of students.
While Daiki's case is unusual, another school near Ichinosetakahashi also has just a single pupil, and so does a school in the southern city of Kumamoto.

The Education Ministry says it does not know how many single-student schools there are in Japan.
But it says the country has 3,324 elementary schools -- 14 percent of the total -- with fewer than 50 students in all grades put together.
Why run an entire school for a single student, regardless of cost?
The main reason is obliviousness to costs, coupled with a feeling of obligation to rural communities that want their children to have a neighborhood school just like city kids.
But Japan's sometimes rigid bureaucracy can also be a factor.
In Daiki's case, the neighboring town operates an elementary school just 20 minutes away.
But the authorities say that because that school falls under a different administrative region, it is inconceivable that Daiki go there.
Income Distributed Too Equitably

''It might be less costly, and we would be happy to make such an arrangement if it were possible,'' said Tadashi Michibayashi, an official in the Enzan board of education.
''But we in the administration have to draw the line somewhere.''
Of the various elements of egalitarianism, Japan is particularly proud of its even distribution of income.
The richest third of the population in Japan enjoys a total income three times as great as that of the poorest third -- compared with more than five times as much in the United States.
Several global studies have found that an egalitarian distribution of income helps promote economic growth within a country.
But by most counts Japan takes it too far.
Japan relies on 65 percent marginal tax rates -- its tax system is among the most progressive in the world -- and Japanese companies suppress income differentials by paying employees according to seniority rather than merit.
The tax rates and corporate practices reflect a psychology of egalitarianism, many say, that has tended to suppress entrepreneurship and hold back the most talented sector of the population.

''And he gave me an answer I'll never forget.
He said: 'It wouldn't be democratic.'
And I thought, gee, these people define democracy very differently.''
Gaining Consensus, Respecting 'Wa'

More broadly, Japan seems troubled by economic changes that are beneficial overall but that make losers out of some people.
Creating losers would upset the society's ''wa,'' or harmony, a value that has been central to Japanese society at least since Prince Shotoku in 604 proclaimed a constitution decreeing ''Wa must be respected.''
The emphasis on wa often impresses visitors, but it also results in paralysis.
Japan has difficulty carrying out changes that benefit the majority but that are vigorously opposed by a small group of prospective losers.
''Japan is a society of consensus, and as long as 30 percent of the population holds out against a decision, the Government will not act,'' said Yoshio Hatano, a former Ambassador to the United Nations.
The tensions between the United States and Japan thus seem to arise not just from Tokyo's political paralysis but more fundamentally from a set of enormously different attitudes and values, not just about economics but about life itself.
''We are at two ends of the spectrum, the U.S. and Japan,'' said Masaru Yoshitomi, one of Japan's leading economists.
Mr. Yoshitomi noted that Japan's egalitarianism runs so deep that when schoolchildren take part in Sports Day activities, the prizes often go not just to the winners of the races but to absolutely every child who takes part.
He suggested that this takes equality too far, breeding cohesion but suppressing the excellence that drives a modern economy.
''There are no outstanding people in Japan,'' Mr. Yoshitomi said, only partly joking, ''and that has to change.''
MARK FALLS.
The nation's largest gay and lesbian church filed suit today against a Chicago television station, accusing the station of breaking its agreement to broadcast an infomercial produced by the church because the station considered the advertisement too controversial.
Leaders of the church, the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, believe the station, WGN-TV, which is seen nationally when it is fed by satellite to cable systems around the country, rejected the infomercial ''based on their views that this is not appropriate content for those stations,'' said a lawyer for the church, Christopher Wolf.
''I think those are code words for homophobia and for antigay discrimination.''
Church officials saw it in part as a counterweight to advertising by conservative Christian groups, including recent full-page newspaper advertisements with people who say they are former homosexuals who ''overcame'' their sexual orientation.
''We just wanted to make our voice heard against the overwhelming onslaught of people using the media to say how bad gay people are,'' said the pastor, the Rev.
Michael Piazza.
''We wanted mostly to reach out to lesbian and gay teen-agers but also people living in rural areas, to tell them there is this possibility that you can be gay and Christian, there is this possibility that you are a child of God.''

Charles J. Sennet, senior counsel for the Tribune Company, which owns WGN-TV, declined to comment on the lawsuit or to explain the network's version of events, saying the company would respond in court.
Mr. Rozansky's version of events differs markedly from the church's.
''I think what they're trying to do is make this a political issue and a slam against gay rights,'' Mr. Rozansky said.
''They are jumping to conclusions and making accusations that are not appropriate and do not logically follow the facts.''

The 30-minute infomercial begins with a montage of antigay demonstrators and speeches by televangelists.
The bulk of the advertisement is devoted to happy church members, both gay and straight, children playing and the church's inclusive philosophy.
Mr. Rozansky said that infomercials that touch on sensitive subjects are routinely turned down by television stations.
He said the other stations, including the Discovery Channel, Black Entertainment Television and Odyssey, had turned the commercial down for varying reasons, including length, religious content and controversial subject matter.
It did, however, break a run of three straight declines, closing at 8,371.97.
''The market is having to deal with some crosscurrents,'' said John H. Shaughnessy, chief strategist at Advest Group.

The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks, which has had a run-up of nearly 20 percent in the last couple of weeks, made a strong comeback in the afternoon but still could not eke out a gain.
Clare W. Zempel, chief strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, was among those regarding the general market advance of recent weeks as more likely to be a building block than a bear-market trap for the unwary.
He pointed to the decline in short-term interest rates in the United States and signs of economic stability in the Far East that he said ''strongly suggest that the worst'' of this year's stock decline is past.
As for Brazil, Mr. Zempel said it would probably ''muddle through.''

Although foreign economic and financial turmoil has in the last 15 months supplanted Washington's economic reports as the dominant market influence, the Government's first estimate of gross domestic product for the third quarter, to be announced tomorrow, will be closely watched for signs that the economy's slowdown might be accelerating, said Rosanne M. Cahn, equity economist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Many analysts already expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again, perhaps as early as mid-November.
A second focal point will be the Labor Department's release today of the employment cost index, a quarterly measure of wage pressure that, like the figures on gross domestic product, has implications for corporate profits.
Rising technology stocks yesterday included Sun Microsystems, up 3 1/16, to 56 11/16, Dell Computer and Cisco Systems, each up 2 1/8, to 64 5/8 and 62 7/8, respectively, and Sun Microsystems, up 3 1/16, to 56 11/16.
Oil stocks were mixed, with Mobil down 3/4 at $72 7/8 after reporting a 45 percent earnings decline, a bit less than expected.
DuPont was the Dow's biggest loser, slumping 2 11/16, to 56 7/8, apparently reflecting a negative discussion of the company's prospects in The Wall Street Journal.

There has been a backlash at the network and the fan level, said Jay Larkin, Showtime senior vice president for sports/event programming.
The fans have really gotten fed up with all the mismatches with no end in sight.
And we've started demanding better fights from the promoters.
Beginning this weekend with the Hamed-McCullough bout, boxing's hit parade will continue through Dec. 19 when Floyd Mayweather Jr., the newly crowned W.B.C.

The agreement should bring in $90 billion that wealthy nations said would provide the framework for a system to protect emerging markets from the turbulence that has ravaged their economies for more than a year.
Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, is considered the most likely candidate for such aid.
In a news conference here today, Mr. Malan said the amount that Brazil would borrow from the I.M.F.
He noted that Brazil, unlike South Korea, Indonesia, Russia, and other victims of the financial firestorms over the last year, has not devalued its currency, the real, or defaulted on debt.
''It's not simple to define the amount, because there is no immediate need for the money,'' Mr. Malan said.
''What there is is a bet that it's possible to re-establish confidence, and the greatest demonstration of success of an operation like this will be precisely a low use of the resources that are made available to us.''
''We are not talking about a rescue operation,'' Mr. Malan said.
The cost of protecting the currency from devaluation, however, has been soaring interest rates, which make investments denominated in reals more attractive but make loans prohibitively costly to many Brazilian businesses, choking economic growth and increasing joblessness.
In a sobering reminder of the impact of high interest rates, the auto parts industry in the Sao Paulo industrial area announced yesterday that it would be laying off 30,000 workers, of a work force that now totals 80,000.
The surge in bank lending has not been enough to offset entirely the decline in the sale of corporate I.O.U.'s.
New offerings of commercial paper have fallen by nearly $20 billion in recent weeks; on top of that, the sale of high-yield corporate bonds, sometimes called junk bonds, has almost disappeared.
These sales normally raise $20 billion a month for companies that lack top-of-the-line credit ratings.

Still, the rise in bank lending ''is somewhat alleviating what would otherwise be a severe credit crunch, and the question is, How long will it keep doing that?''
The great hope is that the global financial crisis will lift early next year.
's, which pay higher interest rates than the Treasuries they are investing in now, will cease to be so nervous and start buying again.
Until the crisis lifts, companies can somehow get by, everyone hopes, either by postponing projects or by borrowing from banks -- if not all the money they want, then at least some of it.
But there is a concern that, even in these final weeks of 1998, the rise in bank lending may be less than meets the eye, and less a support of the national economy than the Federal Reserve's statistics might indicate.

Rather than signaling a flow of new loans, much of the lending appears to be borrowers' drawing on existing lines of credit established months ago.
What's more, while bank loans for general business activity are rising much faster than in the first half of the year, real estate lending is weak.
BANK real estate loans are rising much more slowly now than in the first half of the year.
Home mortgages are flowing fast enough, but loans for the purchase or construction of office buildings, plants and other commercial structures are not.
Banks like to sell to others the real estate loans they originate, and thus limit the amount of risk they bear in the event of defaults.
That is easy for home mortgages, because Federal agencies are big purchasers of these loans.
But commercial real estate loans must be sold into a market of private investors, and investors are not buying these commercial bank loans.
''Applications for commercial mortgages are way up, but the banks are not increasing what they have on the books, not yet,'' said Dennis Yeskey, regional managing director of real estate services for Deloitte & Touche.
A similar ceiling is likely to limit the growth of bank lending for standard business activity, despite the recent surge in such lending, because banks do not like to carry huge loans on their books.
So they syndicate corporate loans, parceling out portions of a big loan to other banks.
And loan syndication is not rising.
''The banks are not going to take that kind of risk,'' said James Davis, president of the Loan Pricing Corporation, which monitors bank lending.
And that is why the banks, for all the current surge in corporate lending, are not likely to sustain the American economy through a financial crisis that lasts past January.

''Now, money is redistributing itself among all financial markets.
If people start getting nervous again, it may reverse.''
In the stock market, however, that view is still widely if not universally held.
Moreover, there is little doubt that the Fed's decision to cut rates in late September and again last month has been vitally significant to the stock market's rally.
''The key thing is that we now have financial leadership worldwide, led by the Fed,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. in Boston.

First, the data.
This year, as in most other years, prices in some individual industries are falling.
Energy prices have dropped almost 10 percent the last year.
Commodity prices have dropped by about 20 percent the last year.
The prices of raw materials, clothes and other imported goods have also declined, partly in response to the economic collapse of Southeast Asia.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But other prices are more than making up for the slack.
Producer prices, excluding energy and food, are rising about 1 percent a year.
Consumer prices are rising by about 2 percent a year.
These rates are small.
But they are nowhere near negative.
Look to the labor market, which drives the formation of prices.
Over the last year, wages and salaries have been rising about 4 percent a year.
Nothing in economic logic or history suggests that wages will suddenly reverse course.
Indeed, even if recession strikes, wages will almost certainly continue to rise, as they have in every recent downturn.
And if wages do not fall, prices will almost certainly not fall either.
Labor costs typically account for two-thirds of the cost of producing goods and services.
In general, wages and prices move up and down together.
They can move in opposite directions, however, in times of rapid gains in productivity.
If, say, workers are given the tools to churn out 5 percent more each hour, then the extra output would yield enough new revenue to allow the company to pay workers 5 percent more even without raising prices.
The company could even cut prices a few percent and still have enough extra revenue to pass along to workers as higher wages.

But productivity is now rising by less than 2 percent a year.
That provides no room for prices to fall if wages continue to rise anywhere near their current 4 percent clip.
As Prof. Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard points out, ''Only in the extreme case of the economy falling into a deep depression like that of the 1930's would the level of prices actually begin a sustained decline.''
Nor are prices falling in any other industrialized economy except Japan.
Throughout Europe, prices are rising very slowly.
In developing countries, inflation rules nearly everywhere outside of China.
Even in the decimated economies of Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand, prices are rising rapidly.
So why the frenzy over deflation?
Robert Solow, Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, attributes some of the chatter about deflation to analytical confusion.
In virtually every industrialized country, the official task of the central bank is to achieve price stability, or roughly zero inflation.
At least since the reign of Paul A. Volcker in the 1980's, Fed chairmen have been measured by their ability to get inflation down.
With prices rising by only 2 percent a year, Mr. Greenspan has come close to victory.
But Mr. Solow observes, ''if average prices are not changing, then, to a rough approximation, half the prices must be falling, while the other half must be rising'' in order to keep the price index relatively level.
To invoke the specter of specific price cuts for oil, apparel and computers as harbingers of deflation is, by this argument, to confuse economics with algebra.
The United States has not experienced deflation since the 1930's.
But though economic historians continue to debate the underlying cause of the Great Depression, they do not dispute the simple proposition that deflation was then, and will almost certainly be in the future, a monetary event.
Translation: prices can only continue to fall if people are given fewer and fewer dollars to spend on good and services.
This is the flip side of the commonplace proposition that inflation can rage only if people are given more and more dollars to spend by the Fed.
It is inconceivable that the Fed would make the same mistake today.
If, as Mr. Greenspan fears, deflation forces drift ashore from Asia, the Fed has an ironclad remedy.
It needs only to step on the monetary pedal, as it has already begun to do cautiously by lowering interest rates.
There are lots of economic forces to fear.
Recession.
Inequality.
Productivity slowdown.
In each case, living standards are at risk and government cannot perfectly anticipate what to do and when to act.
But deflation isn't worth fretting about unless you believe that the United States will suffer a once-in-a-century catastrophe and the Fed will play dumb.
''The odds slightly favor an easing at the next meeting,'' said Bill Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.

Mr. Greenspan did not address the general economic outlook or interest rate policy in his speech today, delivered from Washington by video conference to a meeting of the Securities Industry Association in Florida.
The Fed had cited wariness among lenders and jittery conditions in the financial markets when explaining its last rate cut, on Oct. 15.
During the late summer and early fall, investors around the world rushed away from all but the safest securities and also demanded high levels of liquidity, or the ability to sell at an instant's notice, a development that is ''virtually unprecedented'' and ''startling'' at a time when the economy is strong, inflation is dormant and interest rates are not rising, Mr. Greenspan said today.
But in recent weeks the stock market has marched steadily upward after its precipitous drop during the summer.
More important from the Fed's perspective, there has also been some narrowing of the gap between interest rates on United States Treasury bonds, the worldwide benchmark for investment safety, and bonds issued by companies and other governments.

''It is, of course, plausible that the current episode of investor fright will dissipate, and yield spreads and liquidity premiums will soon fall into more normal ranges,'' Mr. Greenspan said in the speech to the Securities Industry Association.
''Indeed, we are already seeing significant signs of some reversals.''

His answer was that ''when events become too complex and move too rapidly, as appears to be the case today, human beings become demonstrably less able to cope.''
In the financial world, that leads to ''disengagement,'' he said, and ultimately to falling prices.
''That leaves us with the challenge: How can we harness burgeoning international financial flows in a manner that does not strain human evaluation capacities?''
He argued against putting controls on international capital flows, a strategy that is being seriously considered by developing nations and one already adopted by Malaysia.
He noted that governments, central banks and the organizations like the International Monetary Fund were taking steps to develop international banking standards and make sure that investors have more financial information about the countries in which they are investing.
''Doubtless, tomorrow's complexities will dwarf even today's,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
''It is, thus, all the more important to recognize that 21st-century financial regulation is going to increasingly have to rely on private counterparty surveillance to achieve safety and soundness.''
According to Christopher Goldthwait, the senior official of the United States Department of Agriculture who helped negotiate the food accord, the Russians will run out of wheat before their next harvest without American aid.

''We project they will run short some time in the month of July,'' Mr. Goldthwait said in an interview.
Even now Russia is facing regional shortages.
Russia's Agriculture Ministry has reported shortages in 22 of the nation's 89 regions.
Russia's disastrous harvest -- the worst in 45 years -- is just part of the reason.
The tendency of the nation's regions to go their own way, lax government management and Russia's financial crisis have turned a difficult situation into a desperate one.
Many grain producing regions have been hoarding their supply.
The collapse of the banking system and fuel shortages have also delayed the sale and distribution of what food is available to regions that do not produce grain.
''Distribution is a big problem,'' said Viktor F. Lishchenko, a leading agricultural specialist.
''The nation is vast and many local governors practically do not let the grain out of their borders.''
Quantity is not the only problem.
The quality of Russia's store of grain is uneven, diminishing its value for making bread or raising livestock.
The decline in domestic food production has been aggravated by a sharp decline in imports, another consequence of the plummeting value of the nation's currency.
But imports have fallen to a fraction of that and what foreign food is being shipped in is being sold at skyrocketing prices.

''We think the situation is critical,'' said Margarita Plonikova, Moscow representative of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Even ordinary Russians have felt the pinch.
Even before the financial crisis, the annual consumption of meat has declined to about 95 pounds a person, less than half of American levels.
And since the crisis, Russia's pasta factories have been working overtime, a sign that Russians are changing their diet.
Food is not the only problem.
The Russian Government is also struggling to keep its citizens supplied with heat and power.
As the food crisis has grown, the Kremlin only begrudgingly recognized the seriousness of the situation.
Under today's accord, the United States will supply 3.1 million metric tons of food.
That supply includes 1.5 million tons of wheat, which is being provided free.
Another 1.5 million tons of feed grain, meat, dry milk, soybeans, rice, corn and other commodities is being bought by Russia under extremely favorable terms: a 20-year loan at a nominal interest rate.
The United States is also providing 100,000 tons of food to private relief groups for distribution to Russia's needy.

The Russians intend to sell much of the food at home at market rates.
With corruption rampant in Russia, the United States wants to prevent Russian businessmen from raking off the profits.
Instead, the Russians are obliged to use the proceeds to pay pensions and finance other social programs.
The United States is footing the $260 million bill for sending the different shipments for Russia.
Relief organizations, meanwhile, are mounting their own campaigns to buy and distribute food.
Still, American officials said that the food aid may not be sufficient and may need to be increased.
''This is a question that we have left open,'' Mr. Goldthwait said.
''We will continue to assess whether there or not there is a need for additional commodities.''
Correction: November 10, 1998, Tuesday Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about United States food aid for Russia misstated the terms.

They may be abating for a while.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Securities Industry Association on Thursday what many analysts have been observing: Investors and lenders seem to be calming down after weeks of turmoil, easing the threat of a credit crunch and reducing market volatility.
Some Wall Streeters took his remarks to mean that there is now less chance of further interest rate cuts, since the Fed explained the last round by citing investor jitters and the need for market liquidity.
But an economic case for a rate cut gathered strength when the October employment report showed the economy gradually cooling, job growth slowing and wages up only slightly.

In the first concrete sign that recession in Brazil may be slowing Argentina's economy, leading auto makers here have temporarily idled plants and are reporting a drop in car sales.
Argentina has been one of the strongest economic performers in Latin America this year, with an expected growth rate of 5.3 percent, down from 8.2 percent last year.
But while Government officials are optimistically predicting 4.8 percent growth in 1999, recent cutbacks in auto factory man-hours and shrinking auto exports to Brazil are seen as suggesting a much weaker economy ahead.
Martin Redrado, a leading economist and former aide to President Carlos Saul Menem, said that Brazil's interest rates, currently averaging 42 percent, were curtailing car exports there.
The key question is whether the financial rescue package from the International Monetary Fund for Brazil will be sufficient, Mr. Redrado said, then quickly adding, ''I say no because the interest rates are eating up potential savings, and a Brazilian recession will clearly have an effect on trade flows from Argentina.''

That may already be the case, at least judging from auto industry figures announced last week.
Manufacturers reported turning out 40,000 vehicles in October, a 15 percent decrease from the month before and 27 percent below a year earlier.

Still, Argentine auto executives say they will produce about the same number of vehicles this year as last -- 450,000 or so -- with nearly half of them going to Brazil.

But with 20,000 cars sitting in sales lots, and showroom prices declining as much as 10 percent, General Motors, Chrysler, Fiat, Renault and Volkswagen have reduced the work hours of their employees and suspended production in their Argentine plants for several weeks this month.
G.M., for example, is halting production at its factory in Rosario for two weeks, effectively cutting wages for 1,600 workers.
The slowdown in car sales comes as beef prices and other Argentine agricultural exports are falling in price, in part also due to a slowdown in sales to Brazil, the buyer of 30 percent of Argentina's exports.
Nevertheless, Government and private economists are offering a broad range of competing predictions.
Most of those from Wall Street firms estimate that the Argentine economy will grow 1 to 3 percent in 1999, well below Government expectations.
Both Government and private economists here are expressing more confidence in the Brazilian economy than just a few weeks ago, and stock markets around the region are rebounding strongly.
The hurricane that has ravaged Honduras and Nicaragua may also strengthen farm export prices, they say.
Roque Fernandez, the Economy Minister, told reporters recently that economic growth would be virtually flat in the second half of this year.
He added that ''we should start to feel a recovery in the first four months'' of 1999.
But business executives are expressing caution about the world economy and how developments in Asia, Brazil and Russia may reverberate here.
''Japan is very slow in approving its reforms,'' said Jorge Di Fiori, president of the Argentine Chamber of Commerce.
''We have to wait and see if the Brazilian Congress passes the adjustment package, and 1999 is an election year here and that always provokes concerns.''
The Brazilian Government, which recently pledged to slash discretionary spending by $7 billion in an urgent attempt to bolster its economic credibility, has released new budget figures showing that the true reduction will run about half the promised amount.
Total spending would actually increase next year, according to the latest figures, which were announced on Monday.
The package was crucial for Brazil to qualify for a backup loan from the International Monetary Fund and other sources, including the United States Government, and to counter a $30 billion hemorrhage from Brazil's foreign reserves, which have fallen to about $42 billion.
The Clinton Administration is concerned that a default in Brazil -- the world's ninth-largest economy and home to more than half of South America's 300 million people -- could set off repercussions around Latin America, the destination of some 20 percent of United States exports.

Soon after it was released, the Government conceded that the economy, instead of growing, would shrink by 1 percent next year, and some independent economists predict a more severe recession, noting that high interest rates are choking off the supply of capital for industry.
Compared with this year's spending, the Government's budget for next year shows some $3.8 billion in actual savings on discretionary expenses, with the budget dropping to $29.8 billion.
The original budget for next year projected $36.4 billion on discretionary expenses, which include a range of programs, including land purchases for agrarian reform and to extend basic sanitation.
But the Brazilian Government's overall budget, because of court-ordered increases in salaries and benefits, will increase $1.9 billion next year, to $154.2 billion, despite its claims to austerity.
Though some economists, like Paulo Rabello de Castro, of the Rio-based Atlantic Institute, say they are confident that Brazil is on the road to righting itself, they appear discouraged by its current response to the crisis.
The Government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is already fighting skepticism abroad, after he announced another austerity package a year ago, only to drop it as elections neared.
''When you're in a situation like Brazil is in, you usually have to do more than enough to win back confidence,'' Mr. Castro said.

''What I want to see is down the road,'' Mr. Barros said.
''What happens after three or six months as the immediate pressures recede, and people say, 'Okay, Mr. President, why don't you revoke this or that austerity measure?'
''
And the presidents of the House and Senate agreed to shower maximum benefits on the 594 lawmakers who will attend a special session to debate Government cutbacks and tax increases, paying them $47,000 for three months -- a sum that the majority of Brazilian workers, making less than $330 a month, would need at least 11 years to earn.

As the Brazilian Government hoists the banner of austerity and finishes negotiations for an I.M.F.-led standby loan, the gap between the Government's calls for sacrifice and its spending practices appears striking.
Brazil is not the only country whose leaders spend lavishly on furnishings or perks, but some leading economists, like Paulo Rabello de Castro of the Rio de Janeiro-based Atlantic Institute, say that systematic Government overspending is so serious here that it lies at the heart of Brazil's financial crisis.
An undisciplined Government soaks up credit, they say, choking growth of the private sector.
A review of purchase orders from every branch of Government, obtained by The New York Times from a member of the Brazilian Congress concerned about excessive spending, along with official budget figures and spending regulations, suggest that the Government has taken minimal steps to control spending, despite the crisis that has been rolling toward this nation since last autumn, when the Central Bank doubled interest rates in reaction to the crisis in Thailand.
In category after category, Government spending has gone up this year.
Salaries and benefits in the federal judiciary were up 42.8 percent by this August over last, rising to $4.7 billion from $3.2 billion.
At a time of tax increases and pension cutbacks, press reports of loose spending are drawing angry criticism.
''Investments are being cut,'' Sylka dos Santos Carneiro, a reader outraged at a report of Government spending on travel, wrote to the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil.
''Spending on health, education and other 'unimportant things' is being cut.
The country has lost its reason!''
Augusto Carvalho, an opposition Congressman and longtime watchdog of Government waste, said senior officials should set an example of restraint for junior workers.
''If we're going to the I.M.F.
for $30 billion, it's the Brazilian people who are co-signing that loan,'' Mr. Carvalho said.
''The Government shouldn't spend for anything that's not absolutely necessary.''
''It doesn't represent a great savings,'' Ms. Costim said in an interview here.
''But at a time when we're asking people to make sacrifices, we have to make the effort.''

While the gesture may be praiseworthy, the problem runs deeper.
Brazilian civil servants who travel, unlike their American counterparts, are not reimbursed mainly for receipts but given a generous allowance for each day away, a system common in many countries.
A senior Brazilian official visiting Washington, for example, collects $280 a day whether he stays at a five-star hotel or at the ambassador's residence.
An American official on the same trip would collect no more than $168 a day.
The Brazilian stipends, keyed to seniority levels, can add up to a kind of supplemental salary.
The executive branch, though, is reviewing major Government contracts and has ordered each agency to come up with ways to trim spending, she said.
David Fleischer, a professor at the Federal University of Brasilia and the president of the Brazilian chapter of Transparency International, said that after October's national elections, the Government cut the budget for auditing and tax collection, citing the need for austerity.
''It's not even shooting yourself in the foot,'' he said.
''It's shooting yourself in the head.''
Others have pointed out that the $7 billion in budget cuts, announced as part of a $23.5 billion austerity package recently, are not all based on actual savings, but on cuts to a pre-election budget for 1999.
That budget counted on 4 percent economic growth, instead of the 1 percent shrinkage the Government now forecasts for 1999.
In that vein, the President of the Supreme Court, Jose Celso de Mello Filho, boasted of slashing 20 percent from the court's 1999 budget.
''It's in, out.''
Supreme Court justices have also been lobbying for higher salaries, which could reach $18,000 a month.
The new salary would apply to the 24 sitting and retired justices.
At $9,150 a month, the justices already earn more than the President of Brazil, who collects $7,200 a month.
Saying it was ''a very difficult time'' for Brazil, Mr. Mello said he might argue against an increase at a coming meeting.
But Mr. Fleischer and other analysts suggested the justices would probably get their increases later.
''It's more smoke and mirrors for the World Bank, the I.M.F.
''After the I.M.F.
signs off on the loan, it will go back to normal and they'll probably pass the increase.''
But the tribunal itself has also come under fire.
So far this year, seven of its eight ministers, who are political appointees, have spent $640,000 on foreign travel, collecting $358,000 in cash.
''It has to fulfill them.''
Once again, ''investors seem to be discriminating among companies,'' said Daniel Knight, portfolio manager at Columbine Capital Services in Colorado Springs.
''Lower P-E stocks are outperforming high P-E stocks,'' he added, referring to the relationship of prices to earnings.

One prominent speculative casualty was Entremed, which dropped 7 3/4 a share, to 24 7/8, after The Wall Street Journal reported on problems that scientists have had in replicating one of the company's experimental anti-cancer compounds.
By contrast, Earthweb built on its spectacular Wednesday debut by surging another 20 9/16 , to 69 1/4, nearly quintupling in two trading sessions from its initial price of 14 a share.
Oil shares jumped on the assumption that an attack against Iraq would jeopardize at least some Mideast oil supplies.
Chevron, up 3 1/8 a share, to 83, and Exxon, up 2 9/16 , to 72 13/16 , were the Dow's most important performers; without them, the Dow -- with only 10 gainers out of 30 -- would have declined.
Most analysts still expect the Fed to make another cut in short-term interest rates -- and the case for it might have been bolstered a bit with the Labor Department's report that first-time claims for jobless benefits climbed last week to the highest level in four months.
But conviction was missing in the market yesterday.

''Our bond markets have been the beneficiary'' of the refuge demand, said Ken Anderson, who helps manage $14.5 billion in bonds at Evergreen Asset Management in Purchase, N.Y.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.25 percent, from 5.29 percent on Tuesday.
Demand for the dollar was also helped by doubts that Japan's latest plan to increase spending and cut taxes will succeed in lifting its economy out of its worst recession in half a century.
A stronger dollar increases the returns international investors receive on United States assets like bonds, once the proceeds switch to their home currencies.
''A very important debate has begun, sparked by the general realization that you cannot leave people unprotected before the global market,'' said Anthony Giddens, the director of the London School of Economics.
''There is a will to recognize the need for some new governance of the world economy.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The question of just what that new governance should be is creating a world of unusual intellectual flux, one comparable to the post-1945 era in its quest for some overarching design for equitable development.
Just as the development of the New Deal and the European welfare state rescued industrial capitalism from its interwar collapse, so a similar and equally critical quest has now begun at a global level for cushions to the harsher effects of electronic capitalism.
Prominent economists have suggested a global taxation on currency speculation, the establishment of a second United Nations Security Council for economic affairs that would act to avert disaster in the economic field, limits on international flows of capital, and setting target zones for exchange rates.
But such steps, which have fairly wide support in Europe, tend to provoke deep suspicion in the United States, although the danger that further volatility could lead to spreading protectionism and possible political upheavals is widely recognized in Washington.
At the center of the disagreement between Americans and Europeans lies the nature of today's instantaneous world.
Has this new global society amounted to an electronic energizer, as the Clinton Administration has tended to argue, a revolutionary generator of new wealth, new job possibilities and greater freedom?
Or has the brave new world, as many European intellectuals have insisted, been no more than a slick reincarnation of the unfettered capitalism of the 19th century, using new technology to atomize societies, isolate the poor and advance a new ideology of exploitation upheld by an ever-wealthier, on-line global oligarchy?
''We live in an increasingly unequal world,'' said Elmar Altwater, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin, ''and what we have now understood is that this will continue as long as there is no political correction.
Incomes based on labor simply have not grown in real terms, even as income based on the global application of capital has soared.
What is needed is more political intervention.''
Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economist and adviser to the French Prime Minister, said: ''If there are systematic losers from today's global economy, we could be overwhelmed.
A way must be found to bring the Frankenstein of deregulated global financial markets under control.''
Such references to ''Frankenstein'' in the same breath as ''markets'' makes many American economists grimace.
After all, the United States under Bill Clinton has seen the creation of millions of new jobs, a vigorous economy that derived 30 percent of its growth from international expansion and, until recent volatility, consistently soaring share prices.
In Europe, by contrast, high unemployment and increasingly strained social security systems have bolstered a far darker vision, popularized by a best seller called ''The Economic Horror'' by the French writer Viviane Forrestier.
It has sold more than 310,000 copies and been translated into 17 languages.
''Shame should be quoted on the stock exchange for it is an important element of profit,'' Ms. Forrestier writes in one of the milder phrases of her uniformly bleak catalogue of contemporary devastation.

Pierre Bourdieu, a French intellectual with a large and passionate following, a man who is perhaps the nearest figure the country now has to a Jean-Paul Sartre, has made his name with relentless and more sophisticated attacks against what Europeans and Latin Americans generally call ultraliberalism, that is, unfettered free-market orthodoxy.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A dapper, soft-spoken man, Mr. Bourdieu argues that the central aim of ''the pure logic of the market'' has been to weaken every collective group -- the nation itself, the state, labor unions, cooperatives, associations -- to install what he calls a worldwide ''reign of absolute flexibility'' in which international capital and multinational corporations dictate terms of employment and wages.
''Ours is a Darwinian world of insecurity and stress, where the permanent threat of unemployment creates a permanent state of precariousness,'' he has written.
The quest for more equitable development has been strengthened in Europe by the arrival of governments whose intellectual inspiration comes from the left: Tony Blair in London, Lionel Jospin in Paris, Massimo D'Alema in Rome and Gerhard Schroder in Bonn.
It has also been reinforced by the ravages that the rapid, often herdlike daily movement of money across frontiers has recently inflicted on such societies as Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil.
The abrupt unmasking of Russia's sham capitalism -- with its ''stock market,'' its ''financiers'' and its privatized companies beside zero regulation, almost zero tax collection, rampant asset-stripping and a general absence of the rule of law -- has also brought home the danger of exporting a modern capitalist market economy to a society unready for it.
Reviewing this and other fiascos, James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, said last month, ''We have to learn to have a debate where mathematics will not dominate humanity.''
Mr. Clinton, too, has noted recently that a quarter of the world's population now lives in countries in a recession.
He has begun to talk about the need to ''lift the lives of ordinary people.''
Still, what form of regulation the market needs and in what degree remain matters of sharp dispute.
Mr. Blair talks about the ''rebirth of progressive politics,'' by which he seems to mean that the state has an active role to play after the Thatcher years but one that is highly disciplined and ultimately aimed at giving everyone a stake in the national economy.
Mr. Clinton has proposed a ''third way,'' between capitalism and socialism.
The term third way is not new, however, and has been applied during this century to everything from German social democracy through Yugoslav economic experiments to attempted reforms in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev era.
What both Mr. Blair's and Mr. Clinton's formulations have in common, though, is the notion that highly disciplined public entities can bring the necessary balance to market forces.
So far, Western governments have instructed the World Bank to direct extra funds to ''the most vulnerable groups in society'' and provided an extra $90 billion to the International Monetary Fund to be used to try to pre-empt crises.
But these are essentially short-term Band-Aids.
More sweeping measures are certain to meet resistance.
''The last thing the world needs is an economic Security Council at the United Nations,'' said Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs.
''If you really want to undermine confidence, that would do it.''
He added that limits on flows of capital through controls or regulations should be approached warily.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Paul Krugman of M.I.T.
has argued in The New Republic, however, that pressure to constrain or limit international capital flows seems certain to grow if the response to crises continues to be governed by the need to ''mollify market sentiment.''
Mr. Krugman says that cutting interest rates is what is really needed to revive these economies and give poor people in countries like Brazil a better chance to make their way.
Such limits on capital flows would be a body blow to the spirit of American capitalism, which has been so buoyant and dominant since the cold war's end.
This capitalism has been revolutionary, introducing millions of people to stock-holding both directly and through mutual funds.
But capitalism elsewhere has also had a much crueler face as rising poverty rates in Asia, Latin America and Russia show.
The problem, he said, is that that is no longer the case.
Drawing on the model of several imperial villas in Kyoto, the garden incorporates motifs designed to foster personal enlightenment and reflection.
''It's authentic from the point of view of it being a genuine response to the environment, the North Shore of Long Island,'' said Mr. Morrell.
''We're not trying to bulldoze it and erect Mount Fuji.''

Following the land's natural topography, the route to the garden is up a hill, through native beech and maple.
The climb, Mr. Morrell said, represents in some measure an ascent inside one's spiritual self.
At the top of the hill is a gate that marks the beginning of the garden proper, and Mr. Morrell reminds visitors that they are part of its natural totality -- that any line drawn between human beings and their environment is illusory.
''To see it only as a fragment of experience is self-centered.''
The major features of the garden are a pond dotted with lily pads that is fed by a waterfall, and a teahouse that Mr. Humes imported from Japan in 1960, after a trip that inspired him to create the garden.
To reach the pond and teahouse, one descends the hill on a series of stepping stones.
As does the path of life, this path twists and turns.
The stones are surrounded by pools of pebbles, and the temptation is to keep one's feet on the stones alone.
That can be tricky, as many of the stones can only accommodate one foot.
The result is a reflexive and metaphorical taking of one step at a time.
At various points the path diverges into miniature cul-de-sacs, with boundaries marked by groupings of moss-covered rocks and semi-circles of sawn branches a few inches high protruding from the ground.
These areas may be viewed either as symbolic dead ends or as opportunities to pause for a survey of the surroundings -- reminders to stop and smell the roses, as it were, except that here, there are none.
The garden has come to a momentary rest itself, having recently undergone extensive refinishing.
A lack of money, staff and public interest made for an uncertain future.

The conservancy raised $175,000 for renovations, mainly for rejuvenating the waterfall, dredging the pond and erecting a sturdier barrier wall.
The next goal, as yet unscheduled, will be to erect a visitors' center, complete with a sorely needed restroom.
Financing remains a challenge; the staff is almost entirely volunteer and the garden is open only on weekends for half of the year from 11:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. (this year's season ended on Oct. 18).
''What we'd like to do is develop a local board that will take over what we've been doing,'' Ms. Adezio said.
In the meantime, in addition to its natural beauty, the garden offers activities like classes in yoga, tai chi and flower arranging, known as ikebana.
The intricate ritual of correctly kneeling on tatami mats, arranging utensils, folding and unfolding napkins and ladling the tea was a bit daunting for one visitor who had volunteered to serve as honored guest.
''I don't know what I'm doing,'' she said.
''That's a very enlightened statement,'' Mr. Morrell responded.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

There are also appearances by practitioners of sui-zen, or ''blowing meditation,'' who play a bamboo flute called the shakuhachi.
The practice originated in Buddhist temples as a way of achieving enlightenment by concentrating on the simple act of breathing.
The sound of the flute, wafting through the still garden, is melancholy but not mournful.
''It's about the sound; it's not the notes,'' said Darius Kaufmann, a shakuhachi player who is a music graduate of Queens College.
''The notes are almost ludicrously simple, but you can play each one an almost infinite number of ways.''
Clad in a black kimono, ensconced in the teahouse, Mr. Kaufmann explained that he was not performing for the public so much as conducting a personal meditation.
''It's an inner experience -- I find that the trees and the sky are inside the shakuhachi.
I just let the music take me away.''
With its blend of West and East, the stroll garden is an accommodation of two very different cultures.
Significantly, Mr. Morrell has found that recurring tensions between the United States and Japan are not usually mirrored in the attitudes of the patrons.
Japanese visitors generally approve of the garden, but, he added, ''Some of them are a little uncomfortable with a Westerner practicing their art form.''
After an hour or so in the tranquillity of the garden, the temptation is to attribute the infrequency of such remarks to the spirit of the place, as expressed in a sign at the entrance.
In English and Japanese, it reads, ''May peace prevail on Earth.''

Re ''Brazil Is to Get I.M.F.
Package for $42 Billion'' (front page, Nov. 13):

Negotiations regarding economic aid for Brazil have been emphasizing the need for spending cuts.
Brazil is expected to receive billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund in order to shore up investor confidence.
In fact, the $250 billion internal debt that Brazil has accumulated in recent months is primarily a consequence of high interest rates, which only benefit speculative investments.
Who is paying the bill for this?
The budget cuts proposed by the Brazilian Government will be aimed at social spending, including health care, education, agrarian reform and housing and infrastructure projects.
Last month President Fernando Henrique Cardoso mentioned the possibility of taxing short-term investments, but that has been forgotten.

Aaron Miller ended his streak of 31 games without a goal at 1 minute 8 seconds of the third period, scoring over a sprawled Salo to give the Avalanche a 4-2 lead.
Forsberg, who was fed the puck by Valery Kamensky after winning a draw, beat Salo with a wrist shot from the slot.
The Avalanche is 20-0-7 when Forsberg scores a goal.
But Joe Sakic, the Avalanche captain, restored Colorado's lead 25 seconds later, ricocheting the puck off an unsuspecting Salo.
His absence was conspicuous only because the PAVEL BURE trade discussions have heated up in recent days.

The $41.5 billion economic rescue package that Brazil signed last Friday with the International Monetary Fund seems to have reassured investors interested in the country's long-term prospects.

But the terms of the I.M.F.
deal have added to the concerns of ordinary Brazilians.
They require the Government to carry out a combination of spending cuts and tax increases totaling $84 billion over the next three years, which will squeeze the wallets and pocketbooks of Brazil's estimated 165 million people.
Companies have been laying off employees and families tightening their belts for three months in anticipation of the austerity package announced last week.
Stores are already predicting a disastrous Christmas season, after a decline in retail sales of just over 5 percent in September.
''I think we are already living in a recession, and I don't think the I.M.F.
loan is going to be a solution,'' said Jose Roberto Ramiz, a university physical education professor here.
''It's only a palliative that has to be paid some day, and unfortunately the bill for irresponsibility and incorrect policies is going to be paid with a lot of sacrifice by all of us.''
Government statistics indicate that while agriculture and commerce are also suffering, industry, especially manufacturing and construction, has been the sector hardest hit by the crisis.
''Recent figures I have seen show industry declining about 6 percent on a September-to-September basis, and that is very worrying,'' said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, who was president of the central bank when Brazil negotiated its previous I.M.F.
package in 1983.
''That has a lot of social implications, but the Government is going to have to resist pressures to abandon austerity and plunge ahead.''
Debate here now centers not on whether there will be a recession, but on its strength and duration.

After the I.M.F.
agreement was signed last Friday, though, the Government appears to have changed its tune and now argues that any slump will be brief and relatively gentle.
''The combination of external support with internal reforms will permit Brazil to resume growth during 1999,'' Finance Minister Pedro Malan said in the newspaper O Globo over the weekend.
But Mr. Malan's opinion is a minority one, discounted by most outside the Government as excessively optimistic.
Banking and other private analysts have been predicting that the economy may contract as much as 3 percent in 1999 and shrink again in 2000 unless interest rates decline substantially and the Government proves to be really serious about tackling the huge budget and current-account deficits.

''The truth is that we have a difficult year ahead of us, following a year that already has not been all that good,'' said Carlos Kawall, chief economist for Citibank in Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial capital.
''But it won't be a totally lost year if we can get tax reform and reverse the negative tendencies we've seen in public accounts.''
The economy grew at a 5 percent rate, compared with the similar period a year earlier, the 11th consecutive quarterly rise, and exceeding expectations of 3.8 percent in a Bloomberg survey of 13 economists.
Yet while Mexico's two-year expansion has surprised economists and business executives, many think that these more comfortable times are over.
They say that recent rises in energy prices, along with the Government's proposal to increase taxes, will force the economy to lose steam in coming weeks.

The 3,500 Fedex pilots were holding out for nearly as good a deal, dimsissing several offers from the company as below industry standards.
The union was also seeking stronger protections against what it called grueling schedules that have pilots flying at night with little rest.
''The crew force was beginning to shake under Smith's threats,'' said Bob Clement, a union spokesman, referring to Frederick W. Smith, the founder of Federal Express, who is now chairman and chief executive of the FDX Corporation, its Memphis-based holding company.

After an extraordinary meeting Thursday evening, at which many senior pilots urged the union's leadership to settle with the company, the union agreed to declare a moratorium on all job actions for 60 days and to delay tallying a strike-authorization vote, the results of which are scheduled to be announced on Dec. 3.
The pilots will immediately begin flying overtime, something they had been refusing to do since Nov. 9.
In return, Fedex said it would resume contract talks on Monday.
''We are happy to confirm that service to customers will continue uninterrupted.''

The pilots could still strike early next year if negotiations with the company again fall apart.
But the likelihood is small because it seems clear that a majority of the pilots do not have the stomach for it.
In addition, a walkout in January -- a time when package volumes are low and many outside airplanes are available for lease -- represents far less of a threat to the company than one in December.
Indeed, the union's leadership now appears prepared to accept a contract that offers less than what their negotiators rejected on Oct. 30.
The only solace for militant supporters of the union is that it now appears that Fedex will sign a contract with its pilots, a feat in itself at the anti-union company.
''I think you will see the negotiations resolved in a short order,'' said Mr. Clement, the union spokesman.
''You might see a Ford Taurus rather than a Cadillac.
But you will have a contract.''
The office of the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, which had been tipped off by union members to possible impropriety in the Thanksgiving give away, is now looking into the sales of all turkeys bought and distributed in the district council.

''He has not only fed the hungry and done acts of charity and kindness all over the country, indeed all over the world.
It is absolutely appalling that now the very acts that he was praised for many years are now a subject of condemnation.''

In pleading guilty on Friday, Mr. DeCanio said that, acting as a middle man, he gave Bessie Jamison, the president of a local representing 1,800 Board of Education clerical workers, an improperly inflated invoice for the turkeys she bought.

Mr. DeCanio bought his turkeys from the Drohan Company in Woodside, Queens.
In 1995, according to the local's financial records, Robert Taylor, who was then president of the local representing motor vehicle operators, spent $11,000 for 250 turkeys -- $44 per turkey.
''Where'd he get the turkeys from, Peru?''
Members have also noted that sometimes union officials let their friends take more then one turkey.
Edward Blassingame, an urban park ranger, said: ''They used to bring a truck over, and you'd see some people leaving with two, three, four turkeys, while they'd be telling other people, 'Sorry, we've run out of turkeys.'
Many union members also complained that their leaders played favorites in distributing turkeys.
''Some members of the executive board would take cases of turkeys home for themselves,'' Mr. Rosenthal said.

Mr. Taylor's telephone number is unlisted, and district council officials said he was unavailable for comment.
This year, to remove suspicions about the turkey giving process, Mr. Rosenthal's local gave its members $20 vouchers to buy turkeys at Pathmark.
Mr. Saunders, the trustee of the crossing guards' local, did the same thing, substituting vouchers for turkeys.
This performance represents nothing short of a U-turn in investor sentiment.
Euphoria is back for stocks, but confidence has also returned to the arena for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, fueling a recovery in those securities from a moribund state two months ago.

''We've gone through a classic market cycle in a matter of weeks instead of the months or even years that it used to take,'' said John L. Manley, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
Although concerns remain, such as a continuing deterioration in corporate earnings, an Asia mired in overcapacity, uncertainty about Japan's recovery plan and Latin America on the edge, Mr. Manley said investors were anticipating better conditions in the future.
Optimism has also checked into corporate board rooms, as evidenced by yesterday's spate of merger announcements.
Nine deals were announced or reported to be under negotiation yesterday for a total of $40.4 billion, reflecting a belief among many chief executives that a recession is unlikely next year.
[Page C1.]
That most of the deals were done using stock as the acquisition currency indicates how crucial the recent rally has been to deal makers.
Because consumer confidence is inextricably linked to the stock market's performance, the recent run-up in stocks should bolster consumer confidence figures, which will be released today.
These numbers had been falling in recent months along with stocks.
But while investors who own mutual funds that mimic the stock indexes are enjoying big gains, many others are probably feeling left behind.
That is because the surge in the market indexes is, once again, not showing up across the board, with many stocks still well off their peaks.

Indeed, the broad market is only beginning to claw its way back.
According to Salomon Smith Barney, at the starting point of this market surge, on Oct. 8, the average Nasdaq stock was down 54.1 percent and the average S.& P. 500 stock had declined 32.1 percent from their 52-week highs.
Similarly, while the revival of mergers and acquisitions is an indicator of optimism, the activity is still far below the levels reached earlier this year.
Yesterday's $40.4 billion in deals brings the pace this month to $70 billion.
That is up from the low of $51 billion in September, according to the Securities Data Corporation, but nowhere near the spring's levels of $210 billion a month.

Initial public offerings are showing life, too.
But a couple of spectacular one-day gainers hide the fact that many recent offerings are hurting.
So far in 1998, the average initial offering has inched up only one-tenth of a percent.
But separating technology offerings from nontechnology ones exposes a chasm in performance.
According to Securities Data, the average technology offering is up 15.2 percent this year, while the average nontechnology offering is down 8 percent.
As for the volume of deals, investment bankers have raised $9.4 billion in 29 initial offerings since Sept. 1, but three deals -- Conoco, Fox Entertainment and Swisscom -- account for 80 percent of the money raised.
Analysts pointed to several factors driving stock prices.
The single biggest driver is the rapid rise in the nation's money supply.
The figure for M-2 -- the broadest money supply measure that includes checking accounts, savings accounts, money market funds and other assets -- has grown at an annual rate of 9.3 percent in the last three months.
This is the biggest rise since 1987, and much of this money is flooding into stocks.
Another factor propelling equity prices is the large number of investors who are buying back shares to cut their losses on open short positions, or bets that stock prices would decline.
A short position is created when an investor borrows shares and then sells them.
If the share price falls, the investor can profit by buying shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed ones.
Conversely, if the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces a loss.
Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions, are those shares that have been borrowed and sold but not yet covered by repurchase.
Those investors who thought stocks were headed for a fall are now scrambling to limit their losses caused by the big move up.
That is the largest decline in more than a year and indicates that pessimistic traders are having second thoughts.
It has not hurt, of course, that the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times since late September.
The 30-year Treasury bond is yielding 5.25 percent, an unappealing rate for investors accustomed to double-digit gains.
It seems that more and more investors see nowhere else to put their money except in stocks or higher-yielding junk bonds.
Some investors also say there are more interest rate cuts to come, although the Fed has signaled it would prefer to hold off on further reductions.
Jason Trennert, vice president at International Strategy and Investment in New York, says that continuing weakness in gold and commodity prices is predicting further easing by the Fed.
''Most likely monetary policy around the world is too tight,'' he said.
''We're of the opinion that the Fed left the door open for more easings.''
Lower interest rates are a tonic for both stocks and bonds.
As a result, few strategists are willing to say this market's run is over.
''Fear and greed are both contagious,'' Mr. Manley said.
In a good year, a tree will produce 100 pounds of pecans, about 1,000 pounds an acre.
Farmers still speak wistfully of 1978, when the state produced 135 million pounds.
This year's shortfall is forcing prices to $7 or more a pound for halves, up about a $1 from last year's prices.

The harvest, which began about a month ago, is now going full bore and is likely to continue well into December.
You start to see roadside stands that advertise ''new crop pecans'' along the flat highways that radiate south from Macon.
In Georgia, freshness is so important that in mid-October, as the harvest was just getting under way, there were no pecans for sale at a Harry's Farmers Market in Marietta, one of a chain of huge food stores in the Atlanta area.
''We're waiting for this year's crop,'' a clerk said.
A fresh pecan is a revelation, a far different thing from the brown, often wizened nut that you find in bags on supermarket shelves.
At its best, no more than a month off the tree, a pecan is golden, plump and tender, with a mellow, buttery flavor and hardly any of the bitter tannins found in the walnut, a distant relative.
The farmers always hope for an early harvest, starting in mid-October and finishing fast.
Later in the season, when the tree's slender, gray-green leaves begin to drop, they slow the complex sorting and grading process.
And in an off year especially, it becomes a burdensome expense.
''One good day of harvest in October is worth a week in December,'' Mr. Pearson said.
But Mr. Pearson, a gray-haired man who manages to avoid the farmer's weather-beaten look, is into pecan production for keeps, as temperamental as it may be.
Constantly fishing the smooth-shelled oval nuts from his pocket, cracking them in his palms and absent-mindedly munching them, he explained that his great-grandfather came to the region from a town near the Alabama border more than 100 years ago for logging and farming.
Pecans are native to the lower Mississippi Valley but not to Georgia.
They are a relative of the hickory, and their name comes from a Cree word meaning ''bone shell'' or ''hard shell.''
Their botanical name, Carya illinoinensis, or Illinois hickory, may be a misnomer, since you won't find many pecans growing there.
Texas follows Georgia in production, with an average of 60 million pounds a year.
Pecan trees still flourish at Mount Vernon.
The ideal pecan tree -- one that is easy to grow, has a straight trunk that is not vulnerable to storms and matures early with high yields of large, high-quality paper-shell nuts -- has not been developed.
Today, there are more than 500 growers in Georgia but no single major brand to promote them, the way Diamond Walnut Growers has established a market for California walnuts.

Mr. Pearson's grandfather John Winlock Pearson, who was the oldest of six boys and six girls -- a number that gives Big 6 Farms its name -- grew mostly peaches.
Fort Valley is in Peach County.
Mr. Pearson's father, Lawton Pearson, began planting pecans on a large scale after World War II, finding that the two crops complemented each other: they require the same soil and can be harvested at different times.
Mr. Pearson now runs the farm's 1,100 acres of pecans and 1,200 acres of peaches with his brother-in-law Bill McGehee.
''I wish it could be all pecans,'' Mr. Pearson said.
''They're less labor-intensive, and they don't have a lot of competition, the way the peaches do from California.
I think there's a real future for them.''
By future, Mr. Pearson is looking beyond Thanksgiving's pies, or even the few weeks following the holiday when bags of the nuts are added to cookies and gift baskets.
And perhaps he is also looking beyond our shores.
Unlike other indigenous American foods -- corn, beans and potatoes, for example -- pecans have never been embraced by Europeans and are still relatively unknown in Europe or other parts of the world.
Hardly any of the American crop is exported.
Only recently have pecans been grown outside the United States, notably in Australia and South Africa.
But if there is to be future growth in the pecan market, there must also be an appreciation for pecans that goes beyond the pie and a few other confections.
Pecan pie is on every Georgian menu, of course.
It's usually made with nut pieces, not halves, and often has a gooey, pale filling, because many Georgian cooks use granulated sugar and light corn syrup.
Elizabeth Terry, an owner of Elizabeth on 37th, a restaurant in Savannah, said that the more delicate flavor is needed to make the pecan taste stand out.
(She also toasts her pecans for pies.)
It's the same at the venerable New Perry Hotel in Perry.
But Mr. Pearson's wife, Mary, who bakes the pies that the Pearsons sell in their cafe and store, Pearson Farms, also in Perry, uses light brown sugar for a little more intensity.
When it comes to pecan pie in Georgia, everyone is an expert.
But you have to be in Georgia to understand that pecans are also there for breakfast, lunch and dinner year-round, in pancakes, muffins, salads, chicken dishes, fish breading, casserole toppings and desserts.
And also for nibbling plain, an easy habit to acquire when the nuts are so good and so fresh.
And freshness is at the heart of the matter.
They know how to handle pecans in Georgia.
When the season is over, Georgians maintain the quality of the nuts by keeping them refrigerated, which will preserve them for a month or so, or better still, by freezing them, which holds them in top condition for six months or longer.

''If people came down into a grove and tasted a fresh pecan, they might never buy one from a store,'' said Buddy Leger, who grows pecans at L & M Enterprises in nearby Cordele, and who is also the chairman of the state's Pecan Commission.
''We can't get supermarkets to put them in the cooler with the produce.''
Because pecans have such a high fat content -- more than 70 percent, compared with 64 percent for walnuts -- they easily turn rancid and acrid.
But freshness is only the first thing to understand about Georgia's pecans.
Of the 100 or so varieties, about 30 have been developed for commercial production, and several of them are important in Georgia.
Stuarts -- medium to large flattened ovals -- are the most likely to be on store shelves outside the state.
The Schley -- pronounced SLY and more spade-shaped than the Stuart -- has the thinnest shell, making it the easiest to crack; it is often sold in the shell.
The largest of the lot is the Desirable, which is often called ''mammoth'' in mail-order catalogues.
It is fat and meaty but slightly rumpled-looking.
And who would not be intrigued by medium-size ones called Cape Fear?
But local connoisseurs tend to prefer the plump but small, rounded Elliotts.
''Why does anyone need a nut larger than the Elliott, especially when it tastes so good?''
It isn't hard to be won over; they are deliciously sweet and beautiful, in flawless halves.

At Ellis Brothers Pecans, a grower and sheller in Vienna (pronounced vye-AN-nuh), the owners love the Elliott because the neat, perfect halves are easily popped from the shells.
''It doesn't make pieces, and in our business, we want 85 percent of the nuts in halves,'' said Elliot Ellis, who is an owner of the company, which was founded by his father in 1944, and whose first name is a coincidence.
Once the nuts have been harvested and separated from debris like leaves, twigs and stones, they are polished mechanically to remove the natural black streaks that sometimes mark the shells, a process that is strictly cosmetic.
Then the shells are washed in a chlorine solution to sanitize them before they are fed into a bank of crackers, where each nut is grabbed in a little vise and hit by a plunger to break the shell, at the rate of one nut a second.
At Ellis Brothers, which is a relatively small company, 10,000 pounds are processed a day during harvest time.
The nuts pass through a series of contraptions with galvanized metal arms and chutes covered in pecan dust.
In the chutes, extraneous bits of shell are removed, as the nuts are sorted and graded before reaching conveyors, where women do a final inspection and sort the pecans by hand.
Then the nuts are bagged.
Some go directly into the country store in the front of the plant, where they sail off the shelves.
''This year we know we can sell everything we shell,'' Mr. Ellis said.
So, it may pay to stock up on shelled pecans.
Now.
Just remember to put them in the freezer.

His circumspect view may well have sharpened Mr. Moss's performance this year.
It has achieved a return of 14.3 percent through Nov. 20 -- notably north of the 8.4 percent for its better-known, value-oriented sister fund, Harbor International, and the 8.3 percent average for its peer group of foreign stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
Over three years, Harbor International Growth has tallied an average annual return of 18.5 percent versus 16.2 for the sister fund and 9.2 percent for the peer group.

In 1997, as much as 14 percent of the portfolio was in Hong Kong real estate and bank stocks.
Asian companies outside Hong Kong don't tempt him.
''With the debacle of currency devaluations and falls in the stock market, the companies we used to follow in places like the Philippines and Thailand, specifically, are no longer viable, in that their market capitalizations are too low for us to become interested,'' he said.
As for Japan, companies like Sony, Matsushita Electric Industrial and Hitachi ''have unfortunately become cyclical,'' in part because of slowing consumer spending there, he said.
''They are no longer secular growth companies on which one can rely'' for consistent earnings growth, he added.
So how is Mr. Moss playing Europe?
While he doesn't see a recession there, he expects economic growth to slow to 1.5 to 2 percent annually over the next 12 to 18 months, from his estimate of 2.3 to 3 percent for this year.
As a result, earnings in cyclical sectors like chemicals, steel and auto-making are likely to slump, while well-managed noncyclicals -- the kind he prefers, in any case -- should do much better.
That points to drug, telephone and bank companies as outperformers.
He expects European economic growth ''to pick up from the middle of 2000 going forward.''

For companies that can expand, he said, the elimination of economic borders in the European Union offers huge opportunities.
''From the individual company point of view, this will become the United States of Europe,'' he said.
''So you will see the growth of new, pan-European companies.''
HE predicted that many of those companies would be based in southern Europe, where, after decades of high inflation and high interest rates, governments have adopted many of the disciplined economic policies of their northern neighbors.
About one-third of his fund's assets are invested in southern Europe, mainly in banks and telephone companies, which often meet his growth criteria.
The fund's biggest holding, at 6.4 percent of assets, is Unicredito Italiano, a Milan-based bank previously named Credito Italiano.
Its chief executive, Alessandro Profumo, is expanding the company, trimming costs and making it ''very shareholder-friendly,'' Mr. Moss said.
He started buying the stock last year at 3,400 lire.
Another big position in southern Europe, at about 5 percent of the fund's assets, is Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish telephone company, which has about 85 percent of the conventional, fixed-line business in Spain and 71 percent of the cellular market.
Telefonica also has major stakes in phone companies in Latin America, where stock prices tumbled recently.
He predicts earnings growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next four to five years and said share prices would tend to rise at the same rate.

One of International Growth's newest holdings is Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical company, which Mr. Moss began buying at about 780 francs a share in late September.
Sanofi has two new cardiovascular drugs -- Plavix, a blood thinner, and Avapro, which treats high blood pressure -- that it is marketing worldwide with Bristol-Myers Squibb.
''The sales have literally exploded,'' Mr. Moss said.
He forecasts earnings growth of up to 25 percent annually for the next five years.
Computer animation is pushing into new territory on the wings of an unlikely fleet of cartoon airplanes -- characters in a series for preschoolers that began Nov. 2 on the Learning Channel on cable television.
Animators who create two-dimensional characters like those in the shows ''South Park'' and ''Rugrats'' routinely use computer graphics to replicate the hundreds of frames needed to make a character move.
But the creators of the new show, ''Jay Jay the Jet Plane,'' are using a method called real-time performance animation in which the facial expressions of as many as seven actors are detected by sensors and fed into computers, giving expressive vitality to animated characters.
The so-called digital motion-capture technique has never been used for an entire 24-minute show, according to Bruce D. Johnson, a former Hanna-Barbera executive who started Porchlight Entertainment in Los Angeles to create children's programming.
''Jay Jay'' is a joint venture of Porchlight, Chris Walker's Modern Cartoons and the character's creator, David Michel, a Dallas executive who hopes to convert the airplane stories he made up for his son into a licensing franchise.
Digital motion-capture technology has existed for a decade, but its use has been limited to a single virtual character for video or CD-ROM games and for effects in feature films, such as the figures who dangled from ropes in ''Titanic.''
Animated films like ''Antz'' from Dreamworks SKG get their three-dimensional quality through the costly, time-consuming process of adding realistic lighting and backgrounds by computer.
Motion-capture makes animation more affordable by speeding production and lowering costs; it also improves production values by giving characters the humanistic qualities animators strive for, said Joan Collins Carey, a visual-effects producer who is assembling a documentary on computer animation.

''The direction Chris is going is leading the rest of the industry,'' she said.
''This is very good for studios that want to kick out content.''
To orchestrate all the ''Jay Jay'' elements -- seven character performers, two walk-on live-action characters, miniature sets and seven model airplanes -- meant spending $1 million during the last year converting a missile plant in Oxnard, Calif., into a studio.
Proprietary software that synchronizes 35 Compaq Alpha NT computers does the job.

Like a situation comedy, ''Jay Jay'' uses several cameras that shift the audience's point of view.
''We're shooting 11 minutes of production animation a day,'' said Douglas Rask, the show's producer.
''It's a volume unheard of in animation.''
Modern Cartoons falls short of the Holy Grail of animation: the simulation of human motion naturally.
''Jay Jay'' characters rely only on actors' faces; their bodies are airplanes.
But Mr. Walker thinks the show has achieved a breakthrough.
''We've industrialized cartoon production with motion-capture,'' he said.
''I've been working toward this for 12 years.''
The cable network, owned by Discovery Communications and distributed to 70 million homes, has licensed 26 episodes for each of three years.
The partners hope to turn a profit by selling foreign broadcast rights and merchandising.
It's a path well trod by characters like Barney and Teletubbies, and ''Jay Jay'' has an advantage they lacked.
In the last four years, Mr. Michel has sold 250,000 ''Jay Jay'' videos that featured some of the same production techniques, mostly using direct-response advertising on two children's cable channels, Viacom's Nickelodeon and Time Warner's Cartoon Network.
The Learning Channel ''is not a destination point for preschoolers,'' Mr. Michel said.
''They've made a big commitment in giving us a time slot.''
About 1,500 people work in the exchange's open-outcry pits, but more than 200 of them have been retrained to operate trading screens in the offices of the exchange's 212 members.
Some traders said the real test would come with busier trading.
The challenge to the London exchange is driven by the planned introduction of Europe's single currency, the euro, on Jan. 1, which has galvanized European financial markets into cross-border deals to strengthen their position and compete for business in the 11-nation euro zone.
In a further acknowledgment that the insurgents are gaining ground, the London exchange also announced today that from next month it would use two competing euro interest rates as a reference for euro futures contracts -- the Euribor, which is calculated by 57 mostly European banks, and the euro Libor, which is based on daily quotes from 16 international banks.
Traders said it was still unclear which rate would be most commonly used and how much they would differ from each other.

By contrast, moves in other market measures were much more modest.
Gains in the Dow would have been bigger but for a slide in the price of Exxon, which fell 3 3/8, to 71 5/8.
Analysts who say the market has little room to advance further acknowledge that bonds are providing a positive framework for stocks.
''Bond yields are lower, and that is positive, but I still think the market is exhausted,'' said Douglas Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan & Company.
''All the good news is at hand: the buyers are back, and it seems foreign investors, which pretty clearly have a big-cap, technology bias to their buying, are also back in the market.''
Given the drop in bond yields, Mr. Cliggott says that according to his valuation model, stocks are now about 2.5 percent overvalued, a level he concedes is ''not a big deal.''

Analysts attributed much of the decline to profit taking following big gains in recent weeks, and to concerns that major central banks are unlikely to cut interest rates further before the end of the year.
Cisco Systems, which is building much of the Internet's infrastructure, gained 4 3/8, to 79 3/4.
-------------------- Bonds Gain Again

(By Bloomberg News) -- United States bonds rose for a fifth session yesterday, driving 30-year yields to six-week lows, amid optimism that falling oil prices will curb inflation.
A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

Bonds got support earlier, rallying almost a point, as a second day of declines in global stock markets spurred demand for the safety of Treasuries.
But, with stocks up, ''that's taken some steam out of the bond market,'' said John Burgess, who oversees about $90 billion at Bankers Trust.
The drop in oil prices served as a reminder that the Federal Reserve may still cut interest rates for a fourth time, because falling oil prices will hurt economies, especially in Latin America, that depend on oil exports, said Richard Gilhooly, a senior bond strategist at Paribas.
The bank argues that it would have been less harmful to let the currencies fall but keep interest rates low in an effort to revive the economies as quickly as possible.
But that choice would have created other difficulties, worsening inflation and perhaps discouraging foreign investors from returning to those markets for years, other economists argue.

The primary responsibility of the World Bank is tending to the poor, with development programs to help them fight poverty and disease.
The fund focuses chiefly on economic and monetary policy.
The report predicts that most of the countries involved will probably begin climbing out of their recessions next year, with growth continuing in 2000.
But it warns that a rebound is not certain and that ''there is still a substantial risk that the world economy will plunge into recession in 1999,'' particularly if Japan is unable to end its recession.
The report reflects a broader debate among economists and policymakers about whether decisions by the fund and the United States Treasury deepened the crisis and whether the movement in recent years to liberalize financial markets around the world should be dramatically slowed.
It argues that some system should be developed to limit the rush of short-term investments into developing countries that do not have the systems to monitor spending.
The surge is followed by a precipitous flow out.
Few countries, no matter how strong their financial institutions, could have withstood such a turnaround.
Neither the I.M.F.
There are parts that the agencies agree with.
Officials of the fund and the Treasury have often faulted the huge volume of private investment into developing countries, as well as investors' refusal to heed the risks associated with investing in countries with few regulatory safeguards, for creating the conditions that led to the bust.
And the officials say no one foresaw the extent of the crisis.
But they continue to defend their initial strategy of urging Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to raise interest rates, a classic economic solution intended to reassure investors and stabilize currencies.
In Thailand and South Korea, interest rates have declined, to about 7 percent, and the currencies have stabilized, developments that fund officials say vindicate their approach.
The bank report argues that the strategy backfired, stabilizing the currencies at the cost of plunging the countries into deep recessions, with substantial unemployment.

The higher interest rate, the study says, spread the economic pain far beyond the banks, investment funds and real estate companies that got the countries into trouble to begin with, sending thousands of small businesses in to bankruptcy.

''Some estimates are that levels of bankruptcy in Indonesia now are 75 percent,'' Mr. Stiglitz said.
''And, you know, you cannot have a country perform with 75 percent of its firms in bankruptcy.''
Although the World Bank is a major participant in that bailout, it warned today against the risk of what it termed ''rescue creep'' as aid packages grow larger and larger.
''No reasonable amount of public money can stop a justified speculative attack'' on a currency, the World Bank said.
''Larger packages worsen moral hazard problems,'' the risk that investors will expect governments to bail them out, ''and may lead to excessively tough conditions, defeating the end objectives.''
Their differing mandates have often led the World Bank and the I.M.F.
to disagreements.
One of the many proposals here Washington to reform the institutions would merge their governing boards, but that would require a marriage of two extremely different cultures.
The fund also argues that its program in Indonesia was undermined by the refusal of President Suharto's Government to stick to its economic agreements and then by the chaos that resulted in Mr. Suharto's resignation and continues on the streets.

Several months ago the first deputy managing director of the fund, Stanley Fischer, said, ''In most cases governments call us in only after they discover they are in a mess, usually because they didn't do things they needed to do long ago.''
Many of the conclusions in the report are likely to fuel the debate over what to do next.
The bank calls for a major slowdown in the movement to deregulate financial markets in developing countries, a reversal of the policy that the fund advocated as late as April 1997, three months before the troubles in Thailand touched off the crisis.
''Financial-sector liberalization,'' the report adds, ''which can significantly boost the risk of crisis, should proceed with care -- fully and in step with the capacity to design and enforce tighter regulation and supervision.''
In the last year the fund and the Treasury have begun to take the same stance, stressing the need to build regulatory institutions before opening economies to huge capital flows.
The bank praised fund programs in several countries, including their focus on reorganizing corporations and compelling countries, in return for aid, to overhaul bankruptcy systems and inject public money into weak banking systems.
for loosening the conditions on the bailouts to ease the pain on the poor.
But it noted that 17 million more Indonesians are expected to fall below that country's poverty line.
THE YEN RISES.
Some 64.1 percent of all Americans of working age now have jobs, the highest percentage on record.
And even though about 250,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs have been lost this year, American workers on average are earning 3.7 percent more than a year ago, a strong increase at a time when inflation has nearly vanished.

Despite the tightest labor market in decades -- the unemployment rate has been below 5 percent now for nearly a year and a half -- there is little evidence that rising wages are starting to push up prices.
While economic turmoil swirls outside the United States, prime-age workers -- those between the ages of 35 and 54, who are the breadwinners of millions of American families -- are enjoying the same low unemployment rate, 3 percent, as in the best of the Eisenhower years.
The strong labor market suggests that the economy, while expected to slow from the current brisk pace, has plenty of momentum to keep expanding next year.
Wall Street cheered the report, seeing hints that company profits may improve next year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 136 points, closing above 9,000.
The bond market, which often fears that a robust economy threatens to lift inflation, took the unexpectedly strong numbers largely in stride, pushing long-term interest rates up only slightly.

The report appeared to dash any lingering hopes that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates again when it meets later this month for its final monetary policy session of the year.
So far this year, the economy has been growing at a 3.7 percent annual rate and adding an average of 226,000 jobs a month.
The economy entered its 91st month of uninterrupted growth in December, suggesting that the current expansion will soon surpass the 92-month period of growth in the 1980's.
It will beat the record 1960's expansion if growth continues for another year.
Not everything is rosy by any means.
American manufacturers are struggling, and factory workers are losing jobs in large numbers.
Manufacturers shed 47,000 jobs last month after eliminating 61,000 in October.
''There's a spending-and-construction boom and a production bust,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company.
How can the total number of jobs grow so much when so many people appear to be losing theirs?
The answer lies in the capitalist process of constant job destruction and job creation that the economist Joseph Schumpeter termed ''creative destruction'' as long ago as 1942.
Even a large number of layoff announcements, expected to exceed 600,000 this year, pales in a economy that has added more than 19 million jobs this decade and currently employs about 132 million people.

In fact, numbers based on newspaper reports grossly understate the amount of job destruction.
''Big layoff stories are the tip of the iceberg,'' said Steven Davis, a labor economist at the University of Chicago's business school.
Something like one in 10 jobs disappear in a typical year, research by Mr. Davis and others shows.
That means roughly 13 million jobs vanished this year.

When unemployment is this low, workers to fill new jobs have to come from somewhere else.
''If Boeing lays off 20,000 workers, we need them,'' said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business.
Nearly one-third of small businesses surveyed last month reported having trouble filling job openings.
''These are not hamburger-flipping jobs,'' Mr. Dunkelberg added.
Evidence that he is right comes from the rapid rise in average wages -- especially in real, inflation-adjusted terms -- for the last few years.
Of course, there is plenty of pain in manufacturing, which employs about 15 percent of the work force.
American industry is being battered by a nasty combination of slowing capital investment at home, collapsing export markets abroad and surging imports, which depress prices and profits as well as cut into sales.
A sharp 1.6 percent drop in factory orders in October portends further pain ahead.
Since last March, manufacturing payrolls have fallen by nearly a quarter of a million jobs as companies cut production and struggle to rein in costs.
Not surprisingly, the cutbacks have been biggest in those industries that are most affected by foreign trade, including metal, transportation equipment, capital goods, clothing, textiles and electronics.
While manufacturing is in a slump, the rest of the economy is on a tear.
Retailers, gearing up for holiday sales, did lots of hiring, adding 65,000 more workers than they normally do at this time of year.
Over the year, employme
