The ranking Democratic member of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, plans to ask the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a county prosecutor in Ohio today to explore "inappropriate and likely illegal election tampering" in at least one and perhaps several Ohio counties.
The request for an investigation, made in a letter that was also provided to The New York Times, includes accounts from at least two county employees, but is based largely on a sworn affidavit provided by the Hocking County deputy director of elections, Sherole Eaton.
Among other things, Ms. Eaton says in her affidavit that a representative of Triad Governmental Systems, the Ohio firm that created and maintains the vote-counting software in dozens of Ohio counties, made several adjustments to the Hocking County tabulator last Friday, in advance of the state's recount, which is taking place this week.
Ohio recount rules require that only 3 percent of a county's votes be tallied by hand, and typically one or more whole precincts are selected and combined to get the 3 percent sample.
After the hand count, the sample is fed into the tabulator.
If there is no discrepancy, the remaining ballots can be counted by the machine.
Otherwise, a hand recount must be done for the whole county.

Ms. Eaton contends that the Triad employee asked which precinct Hocking County planned to count as its representative 3 percent, and, upon being told, made further adjustments to the machine.

"This is pretty outrageous," Mr. Conyers said.
"We want to pursue it as vigorously as we can."
Over the past 14 years, I have had hundreds of conversations with parents about high school sports careening out of control.
In virtually all of them, the reaction has been the same -- approving nods of solidarity, followed by my own queasy sense that they weren't really listening to a word I said, their own private SportsCenter moment reeling in their heads for their sons and daughters.
Over those 14 years, the excesses have only gotten worse.

As USA Today reported in October, millions upon millions of dollars are being spent on high school football stadiums and related buildings across the country.
Texas, of course, leads the arms race with new or pending high school football stadium projects in the Dallas area alone costing close to $180 million.
But in Jefferson, Ind., as part of a privately financed $8 million building project, there's a new 6,000-seat high school football stadium with an expensive video scoreboard.
In Valdosta, Ga., $7.5 million was spent to renovate its football stadium, including building a museum to the glory of the Valdosta Wildcats.
The arguments for these sports centers are as familiar as they are wearying as they are transparent: the football programs not only are self-sustaining but also support other sports; these are stadiums the community wants so there's no harm, particularly when they are privately financed.

But no community, at least no community I would want my children to live in, can justify any of these monoliths.
In an age where educational resources are dwindling, how can the building of a lavish new stadium or a field house possibly be justified, much less needed?
What does it say to the rest of the student body, the giant-sized majority who do not play football, except that they are inferior, a sloppy second to the football stars who shine on Friday night.
How can a community brag about its ability to get financing for a multimillion-dollar football stadium when it can't conjure up the money to hire more teachers that would lead to the nirvana of smaller class sizes?
If it's the desire of boosters to pour money into sports, and it usually is, then why not use these private funds for a physical education program to reduce obesity among teenagers?
IT isn't simply money that has contributed to the professionalism of high school sports.
As a reporter for The Chicago Tribune, I spent a year uncovering abuses in Illinois as disturbing as anything in Texas -- high school coaches recruiting eighth-grade players with glossy pitches and come-ons straight out of the major-college mold, parents getting so many calls from high school recruiters that they simply had their phones turned off, high school basketball coaches siphoning off Chicago's best players just so they wouldn't compete against them.
Jump a level down into that emotional hell known as travel team -- there isn't a parent of a travel team player who can't recite at least one horror story of another parent going berserk or a coach flipping out in the name of providing 10- and 11- and 12-year-olds with a little extra competition.

In October, the National Association of State Boards of Education issued a report calling for greater oversight of high school athletics because of the alarming trickle-down of virtually every bad college practice.
The list of concerns included steroid use, shady shoe agents, mercenary coaches, dubious recruiting tactics and extravagant gifts.
Steroid abuse does exist in high schools.
As many as 11 percent of the nation's youth have used them, according to a study by the Mayo Clinic.
Based on other research, some of the most disturbing users are freshman high school girls, with a rate of abuse at a minimum of 7 percent.
"We have a moral obligation to prevent the exploitation of high school students," the national association said.

Those are important words, but I'm afraid they are going to fall on deaf ears.
Sports as an institution is every bit as powerful in this country as corporate America or the Catholic Church.
Yet sports are still considered a sidelight, ancillary to our daily experience.
It's still too easy to put on those rose-colored glasses, indulge in Grantland Rice images of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame and Knute Rockne speeches of winning one for the Gipper.
It's too easy to get wrapped up in the supposed character-building elements of it, the false narratives of heroes and come-from-behind glory fed us by newspapers and television networks and cable networks in their ceaseless search for easy emotional aphrodisiacs.
Which means that high school sports will continue to fester into shameful overemphasis in too many places, will continue to emulate the college sports model that is America's educational shame.
Which means that by the time we completely ruin the institution of sports for our teenagers, it will be too late to do anything except appoint a national commission to try to figure out how we could have missed so many warning signs.

"As far as I can tell, there is no economic significance to writing off $9 billion," Mr. Posner said.
"It's an effect of arbitrary accounting choices."
As a result, regulators will probably not force Fannie Mae to sell off large chunks of its portfolio -- the sort of action that could disrupt the mortgage market and cause interest rates to rise, said Brian Rohman, managing director at Weiss, Peck & Greer, an institutional investor.

"I think everybody involved accepts that there's a lot at stake and they need to manage the situation," Mr. Rohman said.
"They don't want Fannie Mae to be in a position where they have to dump a lot of mortgages and push up yields."

Instead, regulators may force the company to gradually reduce its size over the next few months, recognizing that Fannie Mae's mortgage portfolio naturally erodes because homeowners prepay mortgages when they move or when interest rates fall.

The regulators could also force Fannie Mae to strengthen its capital base by finding new investors to buy shares or preferred stock.
The capital is the cushion of cash that Fannie Mae has to shield bondholders from losses if its portfolio of mortgages loses value.
The company may soon face a disruption in its executive suite, as well.
Its senior leaders -- the chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, and the chief financial officer, J. Timothy Howard, are under substantial political and regulatory pressure to resign in the wake of the commission's announcement.

But even that kind of change could be positive, Mr. Rohman said.
New executives might be able to repair Fannie Mae's frayed relationship with the federal government, which is crucial to the company's success, he said.
"If you look at the people running Fannie Mae, the presentation for the last two years is that there is nothing wrong and they've done nothing wrong," Mr. Rohman said.
"The thing that the market is probably reflecting on is you're now looking with greater certainty toward a new management team, and that is good -- that's what we need here."

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, its slightly smaller corporate cousin, are government-sponsored companies that play a crucial role in the home mortgage market.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The two companies issue bonds to investors and use the money raised to buy mortgages from banks, profiting from the difference in rates between the debt they sell and the mortgages they buy.
For example, Fannie Mae might issue bonds yielding 5 percent interest and use the proceeds to buy mortgages with a 6 percent rate.
But the value of mortgages is very sensitive to changes in rates, leaving the companies at risk of large losses if the rates move quickly.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac try to reduce that danger with complex hedging strategies that include derivatives, financial contracts that rise or fall in value based on the value of some underlying measure.
The companies buy derivatives whose value will rise if interest rates move in a way that causes them to lose money on their portfolio of mortgages.
In the past, Freddie Mac has hedged more of its risk than Fannie Mae.
But accounting for the value of derivatives is complex, especially when the derivatives are being used as hedges against other securities.

Understanding Fannie Mae's true profitability is even more complex, accounting experts say.
They point to a measure called the fair-value balance sheet, which includes the value of every part of Fannie Mae's portfolio, including the mortgages it owns, the debt it has issued and its derivatives.
Many accounting experts say that changes in Fannie Mae's fair-value balance sheet are the most important measure of the company's profit or loss for a given period.
Those earnings will be affected by the $9 billion charge.
But the fair-value balance sheet will not, and that is what matters most, Mr. Posner said.
"The fair-value measure -- that's the best measure," he said.
"If the fair-value number was not calculated properly, I'd be very concerned."
Alan Greenspan did what he had to do last Tuesday, raising interest rates for the fifth time in a row by a quarter point, to 2.25 percent, and leaving little doubt that the increases would continue.
But whether the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee will be able to stick to its self-described "measured" pace is an open question.
Much depends on decisions that have more to do with fiscal and trade policy, the domain of President Bush and his merry band of weak-dollar-big-deficit policy makers, than with monetary policy, the domain of the Fed.
That's because the administration's policies exert upward pressure on prices and interest rates, risking what a recent Fed staff report on trade imbalances calls "wrenching changes."
The Fed has to raise rates because continued low rates would only contribute to a glut of dollars, further inflating real estate values and, eventually, other prices as well.
At the same time, however, the Fed must contend with the inflationary pressures inherent in the administration's weak-dollar policy.
The administration believes that it can rely on a weak dollar to fix America's huge trade imbalance, thereby avoiding the more fundamental fix of reducing the huge federal budget deficit.
But a weak dollar runs the risk of inflating the prices of all goods, not just foreign ones, because as imports become more expensive, domestic producers raise prices in tandem.
Moreover, the outsized deficits require huge infusions of capital from abroad, and that need could also lead to higher interest rates as the Treasury attempts to lure lenders to our heavily indebted shores.
Against this backdrop, measured interest-rate increases may someday seem a luxury -- and that someday could be soon.
In a report issued on the day after the Fed's latest rate increase, the Treasury Department reported that money flowing into the United States -- capital that is crucial to finance our deficits -- plummeted in October to $48.1 billion, a 12-month low.
It was the seventh decline this year out of the 10 months for which data has been collected, and that is a bad omen for America's continued ability to finance its deficits on the terms currently being offered.
Meanwhile, higher interest rates hurt job creation and wages.
A majority of working Americans have never participated fully in this economic recovery, now more than three years old.
The need to raise rates before employment and wages have rebounded is another indication of an economy off-kilter.
The Fed's attempt to be "measured" is imperiled by the administration's willingness to risk "wrenching changes."
The wrenching change the country really needs is to move away from profligacy and toward a semblance of balance in fiscal and trade matters.
Mr. Greenspan and his Fed colleagues are expected to raise interest rates further next year, a step that could help the dollar by making it more attractive to invest in bonds in the United States.

Central bankers and finance ministers abroad are important as well.
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, influences decisions on both interest rates and currency interventions.
And Hiroshi Watanabe, vice minister for international affairs at the Finance Ministry of Japan, guides his country's foreign exchange policy.
But in the end, the most important figure may well be Hu Jintao, the Chinese president and Communist Party chief.
The focus should be on Mr. Hu because China has pegged its currency, the yuan, to the dollar.
When this peg is either relaxed or tossed out, the dollar is likely to plunge sharply against it.

Some economists argue that if the Chinese do not allow the yuan to trade more freely, the dollar will not fall enough to reduce the nation's record current-account deficit.

That deficit, the broad gap between the nation's exports and imports of goods and services, is expected to top $600 billion this year.
A weaker dollar could reduce it by making foreign imports more expensive for Americans while American exports are priced more competitively abroad.

Mr. Palmera and Mr. Tovar are not the most typical of combatants in the longest-running war in the Americas, a conflict whose fighters usually come from the ranks of the dispossessed.
But no two adversaries are better known, especially in this tradition-bound city of 350,000.
The loss of favorite sons to two armed groups still confounds, leaving people here shaking their heads and tearful that war sidetracked two men whose lives held so much promise.
Their story is so compelling an example of how war has touched ordinary people that Diomedes Díaz, Colombia's best-known Vallenato crooner, incorporated Mr. Palmera into one of his songs.
"Of course, people must be surprised," Mr. Tovar, 45, dressed in combat fatigues, said in a recent interview.
People have to be surprised by anyone from Valledupar who picks up a gun, because we were never those kinds of people."

Contractors say few if any government officials or pro-government party officials show up for such training sessions.

"Are we overtly partisan?"
"I would say no."
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, responding to Mr. Lavrov's accusations against Freedom House and other contractors earlier this month, said the administration was "pleased" to pay for their work, "for the purpose of making sure that all sides have an opportunity to express their view."
Right now, the only progress seems to lie in the willingness of the re-elected President Bush to face some hard truths:
One certainly involves Iraqi security forces, which have always been presented as the key to American withdrawal.
For more than a year, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other Pentagon officials had been reporting that many tens of thousands of Iraqis were being trained to take over frontline security duties, allowing American forces first to pull back from major cities and then, at a later phase, come home.
Mr. Bush was admirably blunt about it at his news conference on Monday, noting that while a few good generals and some good foot soldiers had been trained, "the whole command structure necessary to have a viable military is not in place."

We are glad to hear Mr. Bush acknowledge this sobering reality, but we are still waiting for him to explain who will have to fill in for these noncombat-ready Iraqis and for how long.
Given the lack of other countries willing to put up their hands as volunteers, the only answer seems to be more American troops, and not just through the spring, as currently planned.
Since the first days of the occupation, American troops have been too light on the ground in Iraq, allowing the looting and sabotage that soon turned into insurgency to get a costly head start.

And facing the need for an expanded American military presence means more than a simple reshuffling of deployments.
If more troops in Iraq are not going to translate into a dangerously exhausted and overstretched Army, Marine Corps and National Guard, these forces need to be expanded through stepped-up recruitment.
That means bigger spending on the least politically attractive part of the military budget, basic personnel salaries, and less for costly new weapons systems.
Another harsh reality that needs to be confronted head-on is the prospect for the Iraqi elections.
But things now appear headed toward a badly skewed result.
Enthusiasm and participation seem high among Shiites and Kurds, who suffered greatly under Sunni minority rule and now thirst for self-government.
But in predominantly Sunni areas, including Mosul, parts of Baghdad and most of central and western Iraq, there is a deep and growing alienation that threatens to depress electoral turnout and provides a large reservoir of support for the insurgency.
Without an acceptable level of participation across Iraq, the elections will not be able to produce a legitimate government capable of standing on its own, mastering the insurgency and surviving without the indefinite presence of large numbers of American troops.
The causes of Sunni alienation from the current political process actually run far deeper, and affect large numbers of people who cannot be classified as Al Qaeda supporters, Islamic fundamentalists or sworn followers of Saddam Hussein.
A broader feeling has begun to take root that Sunnis have no political, professional or personal future in the new Iraq being shaped by Washington and its Shiite and Kurdish allies.
It has fed off the continuing failure to assure that authentic Sunni nationalist politicians had an adequate voice in the interim government and election preparations.
A further level of resentment has been added by the physical destruction of homes, jobs and infrastructure produced by American counterinsurgency campaigns in densely populated Sunni towns like Falluja.
A coalition of Sunni political leaders led by Adnan Pachachi, a respected moderate, has repeatedly called for postponing the January election for several months to encourage broader Sunni participation.
His pleas need to be taken seriously, not brushed aside as they have been till now by Baghdad and Washington.

Leaving Iraq's Sunnis in such a sullen, resentful mood would undermine the creation of a new and stable Iraq and poison its relations with the rest of the Arab world, where Sunnis strongly predominate.
Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, somehow seems unable to recognize this.
Instead of reinforcing him in his folly, the Bush administration should be actively encouraging him to think afresh.
If postponing the election date can ensure more adequate Sunni participation, it is in everyone's interest to do so.
The Bush privatization plan coming into view would work as follows.
Workers now pay to Social Security 6.25 percent of their wages up to $87,900, matched equally by their employer.
Workers would be allowed to divert four percentage points, up to a maximum of $1,000 a year, to private investments in stocks and bonds.
The investment accounts would be limited to highly diversified mutual funds, or even index funds, and the transactions costs would be kept to a minimal 0.3 percent.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
So far so good.
But to make sure there is enough incoming payroll tax to support promised benefits, Social Security benefits guaranteed under the present system would be cut slightly for each dollar the individual worker diverts to his or her private accounts.
More important, future benefits would also be cut by indexing them to the rise in consumer prices rather than, as is now done, to rising wages, which tend, over time, to outpace inflation by a significant margin.
Indexing to prices may look sensible to Americans, but the reduction in future benefits from the present plan is likely to be severe.
By 2075, under the most commonly accepted economic assumptions, indexing benefits to prices rather than wages would mean that benefits would be nearly 50 percent lower than under the current system.
Many privatization plans call for such an adjustment.
Will the magic of private investment accounts make up for the reductions?
The answer is no.
We can compute how retirees fare if they earned the historical average of 4.6 percent a year (after transaction costs) on a portfolio of stocks and bonds.
William Dudley, chief economist of Goldman Sachs, has calculated that benefits for a typical retired one-earner family would come to about 93 percent of the projected benefits from the present Social Security system in 2022.
In 2075, the benefits would fall to only 77 percent of present-system benefits.

So Americans who think privatization will necessarily preserve their retirement incomes should think again.
Most privatization plans involve a decided cut in average benefits.

Still, advocates of privatization correctly point out, these cuts may be less over time than the cuts required to make the present system solvent.
Based on the Social Security Administration projections, monthly benefits may have to be reduced to around 67 percent to 75 percent of projected levels.

But by no means is everyone going to earn the 4.6 percent average.
The history of private investment unmistakably shows that there is a wide dispersion of results.
Some will invest only in bonds, others may choose the wrong mutual fund, or switch from one to another at exactly the wrong times.
And some will have the bad luck of retiring in the midst of a bear market.
Many workers will therefore inevitably earn less, and some considerably less.

To determine how sensitive retirement income is to the rate of investment return, Mr. Dudley worked out some calculations under Reform Model 2.
The results are stunning.
If a worker earns just the respectable expected bond rate of 3 percent a year, or 2.7 percent after transactions costs, then the typical one-earner family will retire on only about 58 percent of the projected benefits under current law.
If the investor earns zero over time, which may well occur for some investors, the projected retirement benefit is only a little more than 38 percent of the current benefit.
These are considerably worse than the projected adjustments needed to bring the present system into balance.
And there are other costs to privatization.
Consider the potential impact from borrowing as much as $2 trillion, which many experts see as the projected transition costs to cover the gap that would arise in payments to current retirees and those retiring soon once workers started diverting into private accounts some of the payroll taxes used to pay benefits.
Financial markets may not absorb that debt without interest rates rising and the dollar falling.

As the privatization arguments are clarified, the ultimate decision Americans will have to make is over the purpose of the public pension system.
For all the alarm over Social Security, the present guaranteed system can be fixed with only moderate tax increases and through less harsh benefit reductions, particularly if Americans are prepared to raise the official retirement age slightly to reflect generally longer life spans.
The privatization plan the Bush administration is leaning toward, in contrast, will divide people into winners and losers.
It may make some workers better off in retirement, and may well reduce costs somewhat to government, if all goes well.
But a significant number of American retirees will do poorly.

The housing market would not have to collapse to have a negative impact on the economy.
Even a lack of appreciation could put a damper on consumer spending by depressing sentiment and the volume of refinancings.
House prices vary significantly by market, of course, and it is reasonable to think that a decline in prices would be most likely in areas that have had the strongest gains.
And those areas are concentrated in states that voted Democratic in the last election.
Rhode Island and California led the list of states, although neither could match the 80 percent rise in the District of Columbia.
In California, the median-price home costs $460,000, and the state association of Realtors says only 19 percent of the state's residents earn enough to afford to buy such a home.
With the trade deficit hitting records, the American government seems to welcome a weak dollar.
But there are surely limits to that.
A nightmare for the Fed would be that it finds itself under pressure to raise rates to support the dollar, just at the time that a weakening housing market needs lower rates to avoid big declines.
If that were to happen, the Fed might regret having done so much to encourage the boom in home prices.

Perhaps Asia's most unlikely democratic leader, Mr. Elbegdorj is a pudgy, bespectacled intellectual whose 41 years track the extraordinary political transformation of this vast, thinly populated nation sandwiched between Russia and China.
Like most members of his 17-member cabinet, Mr. Elbegdorj studied in the Soviet Union but now advocates free market economics.
Now, his Liberty Center foundation, which promotes political and legal reform, is overseeing translations into Mongolian of the works of Milton Friedman and Friedrich A. Hayek.

THE Communist era already seems like ancient history for Mongolia's overwhelmingly young population, which has proved remarkably receptive to democracy and has embraced free speech and free markets.
"We want to show the world that so-called Western values not only belong to America, Europe, South Korea and Japan, but to Mongolia," Mr. Elbegdorj said, proud that Mongolia survives as a multiparty democracy in an authoritarian sea, with China to the south, Russia to the north, North Korea to the east and the autarchies of Central Asia to the west.
Exactly why is a matter of debate.
Historically, Mongolians have been receptive to new ideas and gifted at foreign languages, a heritage of living for centuries on the Silk Road from Asia to Europe.
After 300 years of domination, first by China and then by the Soviet Union, moreover, they have an acute sense of the value of freedom.

Mr. Elbegdorj also points to the role of the United States, which has contributed money and advice in the quest to build strong democratic institutions.

This is actually Mr. Elbegdorj's second turn in the top job.
Now a humbler, more wary Mr. Elbegdorj is back in power, hoping to push Mongolia toward a free market, high-technology economy.
In addition to replacing dead Communists with Genghis Khan in the nation's mythology, he wants English to supplant Russian as Mongolia's primary foreign language, state ministers to hand out their e-mail addresses and an independent public broadcasting board to control Mongolia's state-owned radio and television.
He has grand plans to spin a web of fiber-optic high-speed Internet cables across this land that is twice the size of Texas, and to place a cellphone in the pocket of every herder.

"If I have e-mail access, and you have e-mail access, that makes us more equal," said the prime minister, who often answers questions on his new bilingual Mongolian-English Web site: www.open-government.mn.
Warier of his opponents this time around, he devotes weekends to politicking and building support: Saturdays for trips to the interior and Sundays for socializing with cabinet members, half of whom are allied with the former Communists.
"In the classroom, everything is plain, you don't feel the heat," he said.

Militarily and diplomatically, China is flexing new muscles as well.

Then there is North Korea, a constant destabilizing force even though it is 500 miles away.
The problem is that defectors make their way through China to the Mongolian border, where Mongolia is committed to providing them a haven until transport can be arranged to a country that will accept them, usually South Korea.
Anything that encourages defections, however, is sure to irritate China.
For protection in the neighborhood, Mongolia is counting on close ties with the United States.
It regularly unrolls the red carpet for visiting American officials, most recently Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, the commander of United States forces in the Pacific.

Asked if Mongolia would continue to send soldiers to Iraq, the prime minister's face clouded.
"If America asks us to send a fourth contingent," he started.
The consequences of that decision can be seen in government statistics and in stores, where consumers once again were spending robustly before Christmas.
More than two million jobs have been created since the depths of the crisis early in 2002, and according to official figures, inflation-adjusted income has also bounced back, returning almost to the level of the late 1990's.
That is when the crisis emerged, as Argentina sought to tighten its belt according to I.M.F.

Some of the new jobs are from a low-paying government make-work program, but nearly half are in the private sector.
As a result, unemployment has declined from more than 20 percent to about 13 percent, and the number of Argentines living below the poverty line has fallen by nearly 10 points from the record high of 53.4 percent early in 2002.
"Things are by no means back to normal, but we've got the feeling we're back on the right track," said Mario Alberto Ortiz, a refrigeration repairman.
"For the first time since things fell apart, I can actually afford to spend a little money."
Traditional free-market economists remain skeptical of the government's approach.
While acknowledging there has been a recovery, they attribute it mainly to external factors rather than the policies of President Néstor Kirchner, who has been in office since May 2003.
Increasingly, they also maintain that the comeback is beginning to lose steam.

"We've been lucky," said Juan Luis Bour, chief economist at the Latin American Foundation for Economic Research here.
"We've had high prices for commodities and low interest rates.

The I.M.F., which Argentine officials blame for inducing the crisis in the first place, argues that the current government is acting at least in part as the I.M.F.
has always recommended.
It has limited spending and moved to increase revenues, a classic prescription when an economy is ailing, and has built up a surplus twice the size of what the fund had asked before negotiations were put on hold several months ago.

"The return to these encouraging numbers has been helped a lot by a fiscal discipline that is almost unprecedented by Argentine standards," said John Dodsworth, the senior I.M.F.
representative here.
"We've had a primary surplus which has increased steadily over these past few years at both the central and provincial levels, and that has been the main anchor on the economic side."
But some of that record budget surplus has come from a pair of levies on exports and financial transactions that orthodox economists at the I.M.F.
and elsewhere want to see repealed.
About a third of government revenues are now raised by those taxes, which have surged.

"The I.M.F.
wants these taxes to be eliminated, but on the other hand they also want Argentina to improve its offer to creditors and also pay back the fund so it can reduce its own exposure here," said Alan Cibils, an Argentine economist associated with the independent Interdisciplinary Center for the Study of Public Policy here.
"In other words, they are saying, 'You have to pay out more and take in less,' which is a sure prescription for another crisis."
Because of the absence of a debt accord and a stalemate over utility tariffs, some investors, mainly European, continue to shun Argentina, citing what they call the lack of "judicial security."
But others, mainly Latin Americans used to operating in unstable environments or themselves survivors of similar crises, have increased their presence here amid expanding opportunities.

"These are slogans that people repeat without thinking, as if they were parrots," Roberto Lavagna, the minister of the economy, said when asked about the predictions that investment would disappear.

But the bulk of the new investment comes from Argentines who are beginning to spend their money at home, either bringing their savings back from abroad or from under their mattresses.
For the first time in three years, more money is coming into the country than is leaving it.
That has given Mr. Kirchner the luxury of taking a hard line with the monetary fund and with foreign creditors clamoring for repayment.

"The thing is that Argentina has a current account surplus, so they don't really need so much foreign investment," said Claudio Loser, an Argentine economist and the former Western Hemisphere director for the I.M.F.
"Domestic investment is taking place because there are opportunities in agriculture, oil and gas."
Just this week, the government announced that reserves of foreign currency have climbed back to $19.5 billion, their highest level since the crash and more than double the low recorded in the middle of 2002, a year with a net outflow of $12.7 billion.
"The peak of investment in the 1990's was 19.9 percent" of gross domestic product annually "and today it is at 19.1 percent, having risen from a low of 10 percent," Mr. Lavagna said.
The Kirchner administration continues to seek an accord on the $167 billion in debt that is still outstanding, and plans to make what it calls its final offer early next month.
But the turnabout here has inspired such a sense of confidence that the government is not only talking about cutting its last ties to the I.M.F.
but also insisting that any payback to bondholders be linked to Argentina's continued good economic health.

In all, some sat for as long as 50 minutes before finally getting what they had paid good money to see.
At a recent screening of "I 3/5sheart 4/5 Huckabees" in the same theater, the commercials drove one man to shout a strong, all-too-familiar obscenity at the screen.
It may be too early to predict a full-throated consumer uprising.
But the stirrings of rebellion are evident despite the happy talk from some theater owners.
One major chain, Regal Entertainment Group, has cited an Arbitron survey contending that most audiences, especially younger ones, like advertisements.
Jason Thompson is skeptical.

Granted, in a world of wars and killer tsunamis, this issue ranks far down the list of things to keep you tossing and turning at night.
But movies, particularly during Christmas week, are as much a part of America as supersized fast food.
The advent of the commercials leaves some people feeling they are being played for suckers.
"I don't just hate them -- I resent them," Steve Rappaport said on Sunday at Loews Lincoln Square.
"I think the reaction is starting to become more noticeable.
I think it's because the commercials are getting longer."
Another moviegoer, Elizabeth Cooke Levy, objected not only to the advertisements but also to their running when the film is supposed to start.
"I'd like them to show the movie at the time they say they will," she said.
Plainly, the commercials have not stopped ticket prices from steadily rising.
The National Association of Theater Owners -- there's an acronym for you: NATO -- says the average movie ticket in the United States cost $6.03 last year.

Now and then, headline-seeking politicians propose boycotts of theaters to protest high prices.
But that suggestion doesn't fly any more than do occasional calls to stay clear of the concession stands, where theaters really make their money.
One idea from Mr. Thompson's group is to shout at the screen during commercials.
That tactic has clearly begun to enjoy some support in New York.

NYC
The chef and owner, Masayoshi Takayama, who operated Ginza Sushiko in Beverly Hills before relocating to Manhattan, does not present you with a menu or choices.
You are fed what he elects to feed you, most of it sushi, in the sequence and according to the rhythm he decrees.
You do not seize control at Masa.
You surrender it.
You pay to be putty.
And you pay dearly.
The price fluctuates with the season and the availability of certain delicacies.
It now stands at $350 a person before tax, tip and sip of sake or bottled water.
Masa, which reopens Jan. 11 after a holiday break, is arguably the most expensive restaurant in New York.
Lunch or dinner for two can easily exceed $1,000.

Justifiable?
I leave that question to accountants and ethicists.
Worth it?
The answer depends on your budget and priorities.
But in my experience, the silky, melting quality of Masa's toro and uni and sea bream, coupled with the serenity of its ambience, does not exist in New York at a lower price.
Masa is not merely sushi.
The first third of a nearly three-hour meal here entails other indulgences, presented at methodically paced intervals and in prudently restrained portions.
There may be an uni risotto with white truffle; dollops of a perilous blowfish's prized liver; slices of foie gras, to be cooked slightly in a ceramic hot pot; a mound of toro tartare and caviar to be spread on toasted rectangles of Japanese sweet bread.
But the last two-thirds of a meal are devoted to sushi, and Masa is devoted to doing this one very worthy thing to perfection.
You get the best sense of this pursuit if you sit in one of the 10 seats at the hinoki wood bar, sanded so frequently that you catch its faint scent the second you leave the glare and hubbub of the Time Warner Center and enter this diffusely lighted, windowless sanctuary.

Behind the bar stands Mr. Takayama, in a simple white or gray shirt that looks like the top of a monk's robe.
He is often flanked by two other chefs, both in simple black shirts, both with extremely short hair or heads shaved like his, as if any grooming more fanciful would compete with their calling to be vessels for immaculate yellowtail.

A chef makes your sushi a piece or two at a time, reaching for a pristine slab of fluke or Spanish mackerel and using a bone-handled knife to carve a sliver.
He presses wasabi or maybe shiso flakes onto a bed of warm rice, lays the fish atop it and then anoints this jewel with soy sauce, yuzu or sudachi, a limelike Japanese fruit.

From just inches away, you watch this ritual, which culminates in the chef's placing the sushi in front of you with a bare hand.
You in turn use a bare hand to lift it to your lips.
Now the chef watches you, palpably anticipating your delight.
This whole exchange has an immediacy and intimacy unlike anything at more conventional restaurants or for that matter at other upscale sushi bars, which tend not to have Masa's low ratio of sushi priests to sushi supplicants, sometimes one to two, especially at lunch.
Masa deals not in wide-angle splendor and broad-canvas fireworks but in tight close-ups and miniaturist flares.
It prizes simplicity not only in its cuisine but also in its uncluttered environment, which keeps the focus on the food.
Other restaurants strive to be extravagant theaters.
Masa, with 26 seats in all, intends to be a minimalist temple, all neutral colors and reverential hush.
The servers, who bring you finger bowls of lemon water and tell you to turn off your cellphone, seem to have been hired for their genetic inability to speak above a whisper.
The only implements they give you are the ones you need at a given instant, and these are usually made not of silver and crystal but of lacquered wood and bamboo.

Masa is the first Japanese restaurant to receive four stars from The New York Times since Mimi Sheraton gave that rating to Hatsuhana in 1983, and it speaks a culinary idiom distinct from that of New York's other current four-star establishments, all French-inspired.

But it is very much a restaurant of this time and place.
Of a dining culture in which linens and petit fours are no longer nonnegotiable badges of class.
In which a blockbuster main course often cedes its eminence to a subtler succession of small plates.
In which a chef's seriousness is judged not only by his skill but also by the distances he will reach -- and the courier bills he will amass -- in the service and worship of superior ingredients.

Mr. Takayama trawls the globe, reeling in bay scallops from as nearby as New England and grouper from as far as Japan.

Masa certainly has drawbacks, including its reverie-rupturing location in a mall.
If you do not reserve a spot at the bar and wind up sitting at one of the tables away from it, some of the immediacy of the ritual is diminished, and the restaurant's pleasures are dimmed.
But they are by no means extinguished.
Masa is divine.

Currently, those banks include two government-owned behemoths, with about 160 branches each nationwide, and 19 private-sector banks -- some with shares listed on the Baghdad stock exchange -- ranging in size from a single branch to 19.

Many analysts said the industry is in a sorry condition, a legacy of Saddam Hussein's stranglehold on business and a dozen years of United Nations sanctions that prevented many technological advances from reaching the country.
At the government-owned banks, the branches are cold, musty chambers where customers stand in line for hours as employees sit idly at their desks.
While the private banks tend to look better, there are no cash machines or online payments in Iraq.
Banks handle transactions by hand rather than using electronic Swift codes, for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the international standard for moving money.
Though most banks use computers, many branches have antiquated equipment with DOS-based operating systems.
In any case, electricity shortages often render the machines useless.

Moreover, Mr. Hussein's policies of encouraging reliance on the state continue to shadow Iraq's financial industry.
According to a study by Kais al-Badri, an adviser to the Dar Es Salaam Investment Bank, a commercial bank in Baghdad, only 16 percent of the roughly $2 billion on deposit nationwide is in private-sector banks.
Much of the rest remains in the hands of the two state banks: Rafadain, established in 1941, and Rashid, which was spun off from Rafadain in 1988.

Still, the fall of the Hussein regime has encouraged the private sector.
At least two new banks have opened since April 2003, and eight others have submitted applications to open.
Foreigners have begun venturing in, taking advantage of investment laws that grant non-Iraqis a level of access to the country unprecedented in much of the Middle East.
And Iraqi banks, mostly barred by Mr. Hussein from ties to the outside world, have been welcoming foreigners and venturing abroad as well.

Indeed, Iraq's tight credit market has gotten worse.
According to a study by Citigroup, which has no banking operations in Iraq, nearly 30 percent of the country's banking assets remain uninvested, up from 12 percent in 2001.
But some analysts said that Iraqi banks, at least the private-sector ones, will soon be more agile, modern and profitable.
Mr. Kubba said Commercial Bank had already begun taking steps toward introducing Swift codes, bank machines and even credit cards.

Perhaps more important, said Kevin Woelflein, a former United States occupation adviser working with commercial bankers here, is that Iraq's bankers have become bolder, more willing to challenge authority as well as to reach out to the rest of the world, and to do so despite the hardships.

"Don't let stress get the best of you," the caption says.
Maya Native Americans of the Yucatan Peninsula and adjacent parts of Central America developed the New World's most advanced civilization before Columbus.
From local origins around 2,500 years ago, Maya societies rose especially after the year A.D. 250, reaching peaks of population and sophistication in the late 8th century.
The last known date recorded on a Maya monument by their so-called Long Count calendar corresponds to the year 909.
Those problems were exacerbated by droughts, which may have been partly caused by humans themselves through deforestation.
Why weren't these problems obvious to the Maya kings, who could surely see their forests vanishing and their hills becoming eroded?
By extracting wealth from commoners, they could remain well fed while everyone else was slowly starving.

What's more, the kings were preoccupied with their own power struggles.
They had to concentrate on fighting one another and keeping up their images through ostentatious displays of wealth.
By insulating themselves in the short run from the problems of society, the elite merely bought themselves the privilege of being among the last to starve.
Why?

In many respects, Pitcairn and Henderson are tropical paradises, rich in some food sources and essential raw materials.
Pitcairn is home to Southeast Polynesia's largest quarry of stone suited for making adzes, while Henderson has the region's largest breeding seabird colony and its only nesting beach for sea turtles.
Yet the islanders depended on imports from Mangareva Island, hundreds of miles away, for canoes, crops, livestock and oyster shells for making tools.
Unfortunately for the inhabitants of Pitcairn and Henderson, their Mangarevan trading partner collapsed for reasons similar to those underlying the Maya decline: deforestation, erosion and warfare.
The Maya and the Henderson and Pitcairn Islanders are not alone, of course.
Famous victims include the Anasazi in the American Southwest, who abandoned their cities in the 12th century because of environmental problems and climate change, and the Greenland Norse, who disappeared in the 15th century because of all five interacting factors on the checklist.
There were also the ancient Fertile Crescent societies, the Khmer at Angkor Wat, the Moche society of Peru -- the list goes on.

But before we let ourselves get depressed, we should also remember that there is another long list of cultures that have managed to prosper for lengthy periods of time.
Societies in Japan, Tonga, Tikopia, the New Guinea Highlands and Central and Northwest Europe, for example, have all found ways to sustain themselves.
What separates the lost cultures from those that survived?

Half of the answer involves environmental differences: geography deals worse cards to some societies than to others.
But it's not the case that a congenial environment guarantees success: some societies (like the Maya) managed to ruin lush environments, while other societies -- like the Incas, the Inuit, Icelanders and desert Australian Aborigines -- have managed to carry on in some of the earth's most daunting environments.
The other half of the answer involves differences in a society's responses to problems.
Ninth-century New Guinea Highland villagers, 16th-century German landowners, and the Tokugawa shoguns of 17th-century Japan all recognized the deforestation spreading around them and solved the problem, either by developing scientific reforestation (Japan and Germany) or by transplanting tree seedlings (New Guinea).

They reduced wood consumption by turning to light-timbered construction, to fuel-efficient stoves and heaters, and to coal as a source of energy.
At the same time, they increased wood production by developing and carefully managing plantation forests.
In addition, Japan's isolation at the time made it obvious that the country would have to depend on its own resources and couldn't meet its needs by pillaging other countries.
Today, despite having the highest human population density of any large developed country, Japan is more than 70 percent forested.
There is a similar story from Iceland.
Significant erosion ensued, carrying half of Iceland's topsoil into the ocean within a century or two.

What lessons can we draw from history?
The most straightforward: take environmental problems seriously.
They destroyed societies in the past, and they are even more likely to do so now.
If 6,000 Polynesians with stone tools were able to destroy Mangareva Island, consider what six billion people with metal tools and bulldozers are doing today.
Moreover, while the Maya collapse affected just a few neighboring societies in Central America, globalization now means that any society's problems have the potential to affect anyone else.
Just think how crises in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq have shaped the United States today.
Other lessons involve failures of group decision-making.
There are many reasons why past societies made bad decisions, and thereby failed to solve or even to perceive the problems that would eventually destroy them.
One reason involves conflicts of interest, whereby one group within a society (for instance, the pig farmers who caused the worst erosion in medieval Greenland and Iceland) can profit by engaging in practices that damage the rest of society.
Another is the pursuit of short-term gains at the expense of long-term survival, as when fishermen overfish the stocks on which their livelihoods ultimately depend.

History also teaches us two deeper lessons about what separates successful societies from those heading toward failure.
A society contains a built-in blueprint for failure if the elite insulates itself from the consequences of its actions.

Could this happen in the United States?
It's a thought that often occurs to me here in Los Angeles, when I drive by gated communities, guarded by private security patrols, and filled with people who drink bottled water, depend on private pensions, and send their children to private schools.
By doing these things, they lose the motivation to support the police force, the municipal water supply, Social Security and public schools.
If conditions deteriorate too much for poorer people, gates will not keep the rioters out.
Rioters eventually burned the palaces of Maya kings and tore down the statues of Easter Island chiefs; they have also already threatened wealthy districts in Los Angeles twice in recent decades.
In contrast, the elite in 17th-century Japan, as in modern Scandinavia and the Netherlands, could not ignore or insulate themselves from broad societal problems.
For instance, the Dutch upper class for hundreds of years has been unable to insulate itself from the Netherlands' water management problems for a simple reason: the rich live in the same drained lands below sea level as the poor.
If the dikes and pumps keeping out the sea fail, the well-off Dutch know that they will drown along with everybody else, which is precisely what happened during the floods of 1953.

The other deep lesson involves a willingness to re-examine long-held core values, when conditions change and those values no longer make sense.
They died off as a result, leaving Greenland to the Inuit.
On the other hand, the British in the 1950's faced up to the need for a painful reappraisal of their former status as rulers of a world empire set apart from Europe.

In this New Year, we Americans have our own painful reappraisals to face.
We can't continue to deplete our own resources as well as those of much of the rest of the world.
Now, technology and global interconnectedness have robbed us of our protection.
In recent years, we have responded to foreign threats largely by seeking short-term military solutions at the last minute.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But how long can we keep this up?
Though we are the richest nation on earth, there's simply no way we can afford (or muster the troops) to intervene in the dozens of countries where emerging threats lurk -- particularly when each intervention these days can cost more than $100 billion and require more than 100,000 troops.
A genuine reappraisal would require us to recognize that it will be far less expensive and far more effective to address the underlying problems of public health, population and environment that ultimately cause threats to us to emerge in poor countries.
In the past, we have regarded foreign aid as either charity or as buying support; now, it's an act of self-interest to preserve our own economy and protect American lives.
Do we have cause for hope?
Many of my friends are pessimistic when they contemplate the world's growing population and human demands colliding with shrinking resources.
But I draw hope from the knowledge that humanity's biggest problems today are ones entirely of our own making.
Asteroids hurtling at us beyond our control don't figure high on our list of imminent dangers.
To save ourselves, we don't need new technology: we just need the political will to face up to our problems of population and the environment.
I also draw hope from a unique advantage that we enjoy.
Unlike any previous society in history, our global society today is the first with the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of societies remote from us in space and in time.
We, on the other hand, have a detailed chronicle of human successes and failures at our disposal.
Will we choose to use it?

In 1882, having perfected his incandescent bulbs, Edison turned his attention to building a DC electrical system that could illuminate them.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
At 3 p.m. on Sept. 4, 1882, an employee of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company flipped the main circuit breaker on Pearl Street.
The future success of Edison's DC system must have seemed assured to the inventor and his investors as they celebrated its debut that evening.
Edison had located the plant near his first customers because DC can travel only short distances, as little as half a mile, before losing strength.
To serve New York, and realize his plan, Edison would have needed to build a power plant in every square mile of the city.

There was, unfortunately for Edison, a better, cheaper way to deliver electricity to New York.
And some of Edison's competitors, notably George Westinghouse, were already grasping it.
The alternative was alternating current.

The difference between DC and AC lies mainly in how the voltage travels.
DC is conducted in a constant one-way flow, like the current of a river.
AC is more tidal in motion, oscillating -- flip-flopping, if you will -- between poles of attraction.
The crucial distinction is that AC transmits far better than DC, over longer distance and at higher voltages.
This means that power generated hundreds of miles away, by a waterfall, for instance, can be efficiently and economically distributed to customers in New York and elsewhere.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
It is perhaps not surprising that Edison, who had invested so much effort and money into his patented DC system, failed to appreciate the superior qualities of AC.
As Jill Jonnes writes in "Empires of Light," a history of early electricity, the AC/DC dispute soon degenerated into "one of the most unusual and caustic battles in American corporate history."

Some of Edison's supporters sought to demonstrate the evils of the "damnable current" by publicly electrocuting cats and dogs and, most infamously, an irascible Coney Island elephant named Topsy, whose reign as Luna Park's star attraction ended abruptly when employees of Edison fed 6,600 volts of alternating current into her three-ton bulk.
Indeed, given all of AC's advantages, it is remarkable that DC continued to endure in New York's power grid all these years.

Today, about 1,600 customers still receive DC power in New York.
All are in Manhattan, scattered among Upper West Side apartment houses, Garment District loft buildings, hotels and brownstones.
Typically, these users rely on DC for limited purposes, like feeding the motors of century-old elevators or fire pumps, relics from an earlier age of electricity.
The holdouts have withstood a five-year campaign by Con Edison to wean them from DC, including cajoling letters and escalating surcharges.
Con Ed's patience is wearing thin.

"I have a drop-dead date," said Stephen F. Wood, the utility's vice president of energy services and point man on DC elimination.
"The president of the company has basically said: 'You've committed to getting this out of the system by the end of 2005.
Now make it happen."'
Since then, Con Ed has been converting AC to DC by way of hundreds of underground rectifiers.
Maintaining two separate power systems, one quite old, is cumbersome, and, Mr. Wood added, "DC gives us a higher percentage of problems per section of cable than we get from the AC system."

Whatever the solution, it's unclear how many of the 1,600 will comply with Con Ed's deadline.
"We know we'll have some customers, a limited number, who are going to be very difficult," Mr. Wood allowed.
"Probably a couple hundred who are going to hold out to the bitter end."
DC is not altogether doomed for extinction in New York.
The subway has run on DC since it first began operating a century ago and will continue to do so.
But as a public utility, after almost 123 years of faithful service, give or take the occasional blackout, DC is quietly taking its last rounds before the lights go out.

The argument was convincing, but wrong.
Short-term interest rates are higher now, but long-term rates are nearly the same.
Now, points out Kerry Reilly of Bridgewater Associates, traders are expecting long-term rates to rise in 2005, but not nearly so much as they had wrongly forecast for 2004.
The housing market lives on, with some measures showing American house prices rising at a record rate, as are American spending patterns.
That is one reason the American trade deficit has risen to record levels, and that in turn is a reason for the widespread expectation that the dollar must continue to fall.

Longer term, it is hard to see how the United States can withstand a current account deficit of more than 5 percent of gross domestic product.
But, in fact, the trend can continue as long as foreigners are willing to take dollars for their cars, toys and clothing, and not insist on exchanging the dollar for other currencies.
And that means they must find acceptable dollar-denominated assets in which to invest their dollars.
A few years ago, foreigners were happy to buy American stocks, but that demand has almost vanished.
In 2000, foreigners were net buyers of $458 billion of American securities, with 38 percent of that amount going into stocks.

Contrarians could argue that is a positive indicator: foreign investors rarely show good market timing in most parts of the world, presumably for want of local knowledge.
So foreigners' lack of interest in American stocks could be a sign that the stock market is not near a peak.

But it also means that they must do something else with their dollars, and that has led to huge purchases of Treasury and corporate bonds.
At first glance American bonds might seem unattractive given low interest rates and the prospect of a decline in the dollar that could more than offset the interest income for foreign holders.
But so far foreigners' desire to keep the dollar from tumbling -- and hurting their own economies -- has led them to keep buying bonds.
Asian central banks, particularly those in China and Japan, have been voracious buyers of Treasuries.

Those purchases have held interest rates down and encouraged American consumers, thus contributing to growth in the United States and abroad.

As this year begins, huge sums have been wagered in one form or another that the Chinese will finally let their currency appreciate, no longer fixing its rate to the dollar.
The Chinese have warned that they will not act as long as the speculators are active, but that warning does not appear to have deterred many who have sought to evade currency controls and acquire yuan that they expect to rise in value.
When Asian currencies do increase, the cost of imported goods will rise in America, producing inflation.
But it is not clear what impact that will have on the stock market.
A falling dollar would make American stocks look cheaper overseas, which could stimulate buying.
But a fear that the dollar would keep falling could frighten foreigners away from American stocks.
The lack of overseas interest in American stocks in 2004 may have helped dampen the stock market's gains, but it did not send it down.

For the year, Daimler's share of the United States market rose to 14.4 percent from 14.1 percent in 2003, according to Autodata.
But many analysts say it is only a matter of time before Toyota, the fourth-largest seller of cars and trucks in the United States, surpasses DaimlerChrysler and breaks up the traditional Big Three.

But even as groups opposed to Mr. Bush's call for personal accounts intensify their efforts, the White House is still trying to develop a plan that can hold Republicans together while attracting at least a handful of Democrats in Congress, say administration officials, conservative activists, members of Congress and economists.

The main issues, they said, are whether Mr. Bush should back a proposal to reduce substantially the guaranteed government retirement benefit through a change in the way the benefit is calculated, and whether workers should be allowed to contribute all of their Social Security payroll taxes into their accounts or only a part.
The indications so far, they said, are that Mr. Bush will stick with his inclination to reduce scheduled benefits to assure the retirement system's long-term solvency, and that he will back smaller accounts than many of his supporters would like.
But to bridge the gap between the sides in the debate, they said, the administration is considering several proposals, including phasing in increases in the size of the accounts over many years or allowing lower-income workers to invest a higher proportion of their wages in private accounts than upper-income people would be permitted to invest.
One group of Republicans is pressing the administration to make the accounts as big as possible, preferably permitting the investment of all or nearly all of the 6.2 percent levy on wages that individuals contribute to Social Security.
(Under all proposals, employers would continue to pay an additional 6.2 percent tax on each employee's wages up to a wage cap that this year is $90,000.)
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Many of the same Republicans have also come out forcefully against a proposal to deal with Social Security's long-term financial problems by reducing the part of future retirement benefits that would come from the government.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Their approach is embodied in legislation introduced in Congress by Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, and Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.
Their plan would allow investment of 6 percent of the wages subject to the payroll tax and would not mandate across-the-board reductions in scheduled benefits.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That approach is viewed warily by many other Republicans.
Those Republicans say that diverting money that would otherwise go to pay benefits into the private accounts would lead to a sharp spike in the budget deficit in the short run.
They say the approach would also raise what they say is a false expectation that Social Security's problems can be addressed without any painful steps.
But the approach has been embraced by some other high-profile Republicans, who say it would be a bold move to harness the power of markets to address social and economic issues and would in the long run leave the nation in much stronger financial condition.
"The president should go for a very large account because it's going to take exactly the same amount of energy to get a large account as a small one, and you get a dramatically bigger reward with a large account," said Newt Gingrich, a Republican and former House speaker.
"And anything that changes benefits on an involuntary basis will allow the Democrats, the AARP and the unions to beat our brains in.
It isn't politically doable."

But another camp, which includes many of the White House economic advisers, supports reducing the guaranteed benefit by switching from a system that calculates the initial benefit a worker receives at retirement based on how fast wages are growing throughout the economy.
In its place would be a formula setting the initial benefit based on how fast prices rise.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Since wages tend to grow faster than prices, the shift would sharply reduce the growth of benefits in coming decades, helping close the projected gap between how much money Social Security takes in and how much it pays out.
But critics, including most Democrats, say the change would leave future retirees unable to keep up with improvements in living standards.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The camp that favors the shift in calculating benefits has also tended to favor limiting contributions to the personal accounts to 2 percent or 3 percent of the wages subject to the payroll tax, in part to hold down the need for the government to borrow hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars in coming decades.
Some economists and business groups that support Mr. Bush on Social Security say financial markets are already jittery about the government's ability to rein in the budget and trade deficits and that more borrowing could lead to a faster fall in the value of the dollar, higher interest rates and slower economic growth.
But there has been a wave of signals from the White House recently about where he seems to be headed.

"You may know that there is a small number of conservatives who prefer to push only for investment accounts and make no effort to adjust benefits, therefore making no effort to address this fundamental structural problem," Mr. Wehner said in the message.
"In my judgment, that's a bad idea.
We simply cannot solve the Social Security problem with personal retirement accounts alone."
Similarly, White House officials have made no secret that they are most comfortable with proposals that hold the size of the accounts to well below the 6 percent proposal in the Ryan-Sununu bill.
They often point to plans like one developed in 2001 by Mr. Bush's Social Security commission that would allow lower-income workers to place up to 4 percent of their wages into their accounts, up to a cap of $1,000.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That dollar cap would also apply to people at higher income levels, though, meaning the percentage of their income they could invest through the accounts would be considerably less -- barely 1 percent for someone earning $90,000.
Seeking to head off unhappiness among Republicans who want Mr. Bush to take the bolder route, White House officials have been emphasizing the importance of unifying behind whatever plan has the best chance of being signed into law.
In his e-mail message, Mr. Wehner said that achieving Mr. Bush's basic goals of putting Social Security on sound financial footing while adding personal accounts would "rank as one of the most significant conservative governing achievements ever."
If Mr. Bush chooses too cautious an approach, "the enthusiasm among a lot of conservatives will wane," said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and activist who just founded an advocacy group, the Free Enterprise Foundation, to push action on issues including Social Security and tax reform.

For factory workers, the December numbers provided no hint of better times ahead, even though American exports have climbed sharply in the last year.
The figure released Friday means that the economy has edged close to the number of jobs that existed before the 2001 recession began.
But that job growth has lagged far behind the population, which has climbed by more than 10 million people since then.
After declining by more than 2 million jobs over the next two years, employment climbed back to 132.3 million jobs in December.

But the dollar's fall has increased returns for some debt, particularly Russian and Korean bonds denominated in local currencies.

Mohamed El-Erian, who runs the Pimco Emerging Markets Bond fund, which was up 11.8 percent in 2004 and about 17 percent, annualized, in the last three years, is cautious.
"There is a big elephant in the room," he said.
"How will the world account for the current account deficit that has been mounting for the United States?"
If rates in the United States spike up because investors lose confidence, he said, the impact could be rough for emerging markets, which tend to decline in times of volatility.
Mr. El-Erian said that in such circumstances, many investors would likely prefer the safest and most stable currencies, so they would put their money into United States bonds, rather than those of emerging markets.

Is there a reason to put a small portion of one's savings into emerging-markets funds?
With interest rates in the United States still relatively low, yields on Brazilian government 10-year bonds, for example, are more than 8 percent, almost double that of comparable Treasuries.
And if investors believe that specific emerging-market countries are improving their credit worthiness, their bonds could become more valuable.

But several analysts say investors should hedge their bets.
Dollar-denominated bonds also tend to be traded more widely on international markets.
GENERALLY, analysts also say that during periods of volatility, it is better to hold bonds of shorter duration, which are less vulnerable to shifts in interest rates.
But even efforts to protect against global volatility, and against problems in individual markets, may not be enough to insulate investors against some jaw-dropping fluctuations.

The sources of that volatility are varied.
Late February is now the time frame mentioned by the White House for unveiling President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security.
The timing is no accident.
By waiting until then, the president will conveniently avoid having to include the cost of privatization -- as much as $2 trillion in new government borrowing over the next 10 years -- in his 2006 budget, expected in early February.
In this and other ways, the administration is manipulating information -- a tacit, yet devastating, acknowledgement, we believe, that an informed public would reject privatizing Social Security.
For the record:
The administration has suggested that it would be justified in borrowing some $2 trillion to establish private accounts because doing so would head off $10 trillion in future Social Security liabilities.
It's bad enough that the $10 trillion is a highly inflated figure, intended to overstate a problem that is reasonably estimated at $3.7 trillion or even considerably less.
Written in early January by Peter Wehner, the president's director of strategic initiatives and a top aide to Karl Rove, the president's political strategist, the memo states unequivocally that under a privatized system, only drastic benefit cuts -- not borrowing -- would relieve Social Security's financial problem.
"If we borrow $1-2 trillion to cover transition costs for personal savings accounts" without making benefit cuts, Mr. Wehner wrote, "we will have borrowed trillions and will still confront more than $10 trillion in unfunded liabilities.
This could easily cause an economic chain reaction: the markets go south, interest rates go up, and the economy stalls out."
At a recent press conference, Mr. Bush exaggerated the timing of the system's shortfall by saying that Social Security would cross the "line into red" in 2018.
According to Congress's budget agency, the system comes up short in 2052; according to the system's trustees, the date is 2042.
The year 2018 is when the system's trustees expect they will have to begin dipping into the Social Security trust fund to pay full benefits.
In suggesting that 2018 is doomsyear, the president is reinforcing a false impression that the trust fund is a worthless pile of I.O.U.
's -- as detractors of Social Security so often claim.
The facts are different: since 1983, payroll taxes have exceeded benefits, with the excess tax revenue invested in interest-bearing Treasury securities.
(An alternative would be to, say, put the money in a mattress.)
That accumulating interest and the securities themselves make up the Social Security trust fund.
If the trust fund's Treasury securities are worthless, someone better tell investors throughout the world, who currently hold $4.3 trillion in Treasury debt that carries the exact same government obligation to pay as the trust fund securities.
The president is irresponsible to even imply that the United States might not honor its debt obligations.
"The secretary will make the case that reform is needed to guarantee retirement benefits for today's youth, given the system's insolvency," said Robert Nichols, a spokesman for Mr.
Snow.
"The byproduct will put the nation's fiscal affairs in order by addressing the $10 trillion in unfunded obligations, a move that will be well received by the financial markets."

But several Wall Street economists expressed doubts about the potential impact on interest rates from floating hundreds of billions of dollars of additional government bonds at a time when it is not clear how the Bush administration is planning to reduce the existing budget deficit.
"The overall impact on the Treasury market would be negative," wrote Kathleen Bostjancic, a senior Merrill Lynch economist, who estimated that the administration plan could lead to increased government borrowing of $54 billion to $120 billion a year for the next 20 years.
Administration officials argue that the new borrowing should have no impact on the market, because investors already know the government faces at least $3.7 trillion in unfunded Social Security obligations over the next 75 years -- $10.4 trillion if projected over an "infinite horizon."

Supporters of the proposal say bond investors have already accepted the argument that any extra borrowing will only be transitional and will be repaid in future decades.

Other analysts note that the increased government borrowing will be offset by the money that flows into personal savings accounts.
"It would be a wash, with no change to overall savings," said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor.

Indeed, thus far bond investors have shown little discomfort about the prospect of vast additional federal borrowing.
Even as President Bush has made it clear that overhauling Social Security is his top domestic priority, long-term interest rates have remained very low, at about 4.2 percent.
But many Wall Street analysts say that bond investors have not yet focused on what the future impact of the plan might be if it became law.
"There is no question that the markets have not reacted negatively," John Lipsky, a supporter of personal Social Security accounts who is chief economist at J.P. Morgan Chase.
"Is it because they are O.K.
with it, or is because they don't think it will happen?
My guess is that a lot of people haven't thought very clearly about it."

A number of economists argue that a substantial need for additional Treasury borrowing over the next decade or two could put extra pressure on interest rates relatively soon, while future benefits are so uncertain that most bond market investors do not take them into account when deciding where to put their money.

"The government has no legal obligation to pay anything in the future," said Richard Berner, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley.
"But once the debt is issued, it will be out there with the full faith and credit of the government behind it.
The benefits -- that's a different story."
Wall Street support is crucial to Mr. Bush's plans.
Financial firms would end up managing much of the money that people would be allowed to divert, under Mr. Bush's approach, from payroll taxes to personal accounts.

Despite the apparent windfall in business that could create, many Wall Street executives are less than enthusiastic about administering tens of millions of very small accounts if, as is likely, the government forces them to charge much lower fees than on traditional mutual funds.

But administration officials have already signaled that the government would probably take responsibility for accounts of less than $5,000, relieving financial companies from dealing with millions of accounts that would probably be unprofitable.
"I think Wall Street will react fairly favorably," said Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of Citigroup, at a conference of economists last weekend.

Far more important is support from bond market investors.
If investors gag at the prospect of vast new federal borrowing, the value of Treasury bonds could plunge and interest rates would rise.
Even a hint of panic in the bond markets would be enough to kill support for Mr. Bush's plans in Congress.

Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a bond-market research firm in New York, said bond investors might become inured to huge government borrowing -- about $1.8 trillion in additional federal debt over the last four years.

But Mr. Crandall said the Social Security plan could require less borrowing than expected, if only because people might adopt personal accounts more reluctantly than either Mr. Bush or his critics anticipate.
Few specialists, however, accept the administration's argument that the huge borrowing years ahead would have no impact on Treasury prices.

Bond investors would be confronted with a very tangible deluge of new Treasury securities to buy and a much hazier promise to reduce borrowing in 30 to 60 years as the government cuts back on future Social Security benefits.

"What if the government comes under pressure to bail out people in the future?"
asked Ms. Bostjancic of Merrill Lynch.
"You could have even more borrowing."
"Theoretically, if we are all sitting in Bonds 101, the math makes sense.
But I think the actual market reaction would be different."

Administration officials have said they also would like to drastically change the way future benefits are calculated, indexing them to rises in consumer prices rather than to increases in wages.
Because wages grow faster than prices over the long term, congressional analysts estimate the change would reduce a person's initial retirement benefit in 2065 by more than 40 percent from what is promised under current law.
"I don't know how you can figure out a law that says what benefits will be in 75 years," Mr. Berner said.
As a result, he continued, investors could conclude that the future cuts were unrealistic and that Mr. Bush's plan would ultimately make borrowing higher rather than lower."
In remarks set for delivery on Wednesday, Mr. Evans cautioned that China's surplus, and what United States officials describe as unfair practices, including alleged government subsidies to exporters and patent violations, could spark retaliation.

"There is no connection between employment and our trade with China," Mr. Griswold said.
"But even if the finding of 1.5 million jobs is correct, it is spread over one decade and a half and that mounts to less than 1 percent of job displacement over the entire period."
Instead of focusing solely on job losses, Mr. Griswold said the report should have included the money China invests in United States Treasury bills that keeps interest rates down.
China's exports of everything from clothing to consumer electronics have been rising rapidly for 2004, and were 33 percent higher last month than in 2003, its ministry of commerce announced.
But high oil prices combined with China's attempts to build emergency oil reserves inflated the cost of the country's imports, until recently offsetting the big expansion of exports.
Lower oil prices are now allowing China's remarkable export performance to show up in bigger and bigger trade surpluses.

To prevent the yuan from rising in value, China's central bank has been buying up the extra dollars flowing into the country from the trade surpluses and from growing investment by multinationals and speculators alike.
The December trade surplus and the accumulation of foreign currency are so large that they are certain to bring renewed calls for Beijing to let the yuan appreciate, which could limit somewhat the competitiveness of Chinese exports, economists said.
But Chinese leaders have been resisting such calls for more than two years, and may prove just as intransigent now, the economists warned.
"The pressure will grow because of the simultaneous release of rapid growth in foreign exchange reserves and record trade surplus," said Desmond Supple, the managing director of Asian research in the Singapore office of Barclays Capital.
But he added, "There's a very sizable difference between political pressure and a change in policy."

Forward contracts based on the value of the yuan a year from now were trading in Singapore late Tuesday at the equivalent of 7.89 yuan to the dollar.
That suggests investors expect the currency to appreciate from its current, government-managed level of 8.28 to the dollar.
The contracts are not for the actual delivery of yuan because of the many restrictions that Beijing still imposes on money flowing in and out of China.
To the immense gratification of party bosses, the Federal Election Commission exercised vigilance over last year's record campaign spending with all the industry of a croupier making sure the players have chips at the ready.
Its greatest contribution to protecting the house odds was the mindboggling decision to allow a new pipeline for unregulated big donations.
A majority of party appointees to the F.E.C.
gummed over the law strategically, once again performing as laissez-faire enablers of shady campaigners.
It is past time to do something about the commission.
Senator John McCain understandably wants it abolished.
He makes a convincing case, supported by a federal judge's ruling last September that struck down 15 separate F.E.C.
interpretations of the new campaign law as devices for creating loopholes, fostering corruption and inviting "rampant circumvention" by party hacks.
It will be a tall order to prod the current Congress, purring with fresh incumbency, into scrapping the commission for an independent body of true regulators who are invested in voters, not fund-raisers.
Looking for a middle road, Washington reformers have begun circulating an intriguing proposal rooted in the expectation that four of the six F.E.C.
seats will become vacant in the next three months.
Nominations have usually come from Congress by way of party leaders diktats, and thats the heart of the problem.
But the law actually provides for the president to make the nominations if he chooses.
In the campaign, President Bush ran afoul of the Democrats aggressive shadow-party groups, condemning them and promising a crackdown.
Here's his chance.

The Paris Club's move came after calls last month by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany for the creditors to extend some form of debt relief to the countries hit by the tsunami.
So far, only Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles have expressed interest in the moratorium.
Thailand, which is relatively wealthier and less indebted, has declined the offer.
Indonesia initially asked for a two-year freeze on debt repayments, with government officials saying it would cost $2.2 billion to rebuild Aceh.

The picture may soon become clearer.
The World Bank is already preparing an initial assessment of the cost of rebuilding Aceh in time for a meeting next week of the Consultative Group for Indonesia, an umbrella organization headed by the World Bank that includes the country's 30 largest foreign lenders.

News of the Paris Club's move raised initial fears that it could harm Indonesia's credit ratings, thereby raising the interest rate the country and its companies would have to pay lenders.
Normally, the country's official debts carry a condition that they not discriminate against any other group of lenders, which means that any debt relief Indonesia may receive from one group of creditors would have to apply to all.
"Because this is a Paris Club initiative only, it is understood they would not force comparable treatment with private-sector debt," said Agost Benard, an associate director at the Standard & Poor's ratings agency in Singapore.

The precise terms of any subsequent moratorium, he said, would have to be worked out between Indonesia and each member of the Paris Club: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.
One central question, analysts said, will be ensuring that the debt payments are directed specifically to Aceh and not diverted by corrupt officials.
Past aid to Indonesia has suffered from widespread "leakage," and bribes are a common feature in Indonesian business.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has asked a nongovernmental agency to set up a program to monitor the aid.
Lending to a broad range of companies is on the rise, with $1.3 trillion in financings completed last year, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation, a research firm.

The biggest boom is in loans to highly indebted companies.
"There's been a party going on for the last year," said Mark Gold, who manages $4 billion in loan portfolios in New York for Trust Company of the West.
The market has been so robust, he said, that there will eventually "be some blowups, probably within the next year or two."

Buyers of bank loans issued by companies like these are basing their optimism, at least in part, on an improving economy that could enhance the prospects of even the weakest businesses.
Defaults on corporate loans have fallen to 1.01 percent of loans outstanding at the end of December, down from 2.25 percent a year earlier, according to S.&P.
That is the lowest default rate since the firm began tracking this data in 1998.
A growing number of investors are also attracted by the floating rates paid to lenders, at a time when interest rates are on the rise.
Loan rates fluctuate based on the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark that borrowers use to reset the rate on their loans, often within three months.

One indication of the popularity of these loans is that assets in mutual funds specializing in corporate loans, known as prime rate funds, rose nearly 58 percent, to $25 billion, according to S.&P.
Still, investors and analysts worry that lenders are taking imprudent risks that will haunt them when the economy eventually slows.

"The credit markets are incredibly complacent," Mr. Lewitt said.
"We're in a huge bubble but nobody knows when it will burst."
Analysts say the high prices at which loans are trading, the low returns that investors are willing to accept, and the weak credit ratings attached to recent offerings are all signs of an overheated market.

A rising percentage of companies raising money in the loan market carry low credit ratings, according to S.&P.
Loans rated B+ or lower accounted for 35 percent of leveraged loans raised last year, up from just 8 percent two years earlier.
Demand is so intense to invest in loans that even companies with uncertain prospects have been able to raise money at rates that got progressively cheaper over the course of the year.
By the end of 2004, companies with debt rated BB could borrow at 1.96 percentage points above the benchmark Libor rate, down from 2.45 percentage points above Libor a year earlier.

In November, for example, R.H. Donnelley, the publisher of yellow page directories, replaced most of a $2.5 billion loan it raised less than three months earlier with a new offering priced 0.50 percentage point cheaper, at 1.75 percentage points above Libor, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation.
The rapid pace of these refinancings is good business for the banks, which earn a fee each time they arrange one of these deals.

"This was one of the busiest years ever" for such deals, said Andrew O'Brien, managing director and head of loan syndication at J.P. Morgan, the largest arranger of corporate loans.
"Companies are eager to obtain as attractive a rate as possible."

Investors who hold these loans often feel they have little choice but to agree to these refinancings, even though their returns on the loans are sharply reduced.
That is because cash is pouring in to bank loan funds at such a fast clip, these fund managers are desperate for a place to invest the cash.
"The banks will tell you that if you don't do this there are plenty of people who will," said a manager of a loan portfolio at a large investment firm.
He says he selectively agrees to such refinancings, as long as he is comfortable with the company's underlying prospects.
"Otherwise, it's a question of where do you reinvest the money?"

Another sign that demand for loans outstrips supply is the lofty prices at which leveraged loans trade.
Nearly 30 percent of leveraged loans trades above 100 percent of face value, according to Markit Group, which tracks loan prices, even though a company redeeming the loan will not pay more than 100 cents.
"Everyone owns Charter," he said.
"It's so big and liquid."
Investors who buy such loans are gambling that the issuers of the debt will not look to replace the loans with new ones anytime soon, so that the interest they are paid in the interim compensates for the high price.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Still, that can be a risky assumption, traders say, because most bank loans, unlike bonds, can be called, or repurchased, at any time.
And with more than a third of all leveraged loans refinanced over the last year, there is a chance that the loan could quickly be replaced.
Investors are increasingly willing to overpay for loans, said another investor, because cash is flooding in to their funds so quickly and they need a place to put it.

One investor said he was finding so few loans trading at reasonable prices that he was sitting on a large cash position.

A short time later, Mr. Boyd said, he was contacted by an architect working for Mr. Rupp.

During a visit to the property this month, Angel Gonzalez, the project supervisor for Mr. Campus's contractor, the Yates Restoration Group, pointed to two locations at the front and back of the building where large sections of brickwork jut several feet above the base of the upper balconies on the Rudolph penthouse.
Mr. Gonzalez also said the brickwork appears to have been anchored with metal ties into the stucco on Mr. Campus's side, which may not be strong enough to hold it.
From inside the penthouse, a visitor can look through windows at sections of brickwork with nothing but mortar to hold them in place.

"It's dangerous," Mr. Gonzalez said.
"It's bad in every sense of the word."
While the city had enough concerns about the wall's structural integrity to threaten to revoke Mr. Rupp's permit, Ms. Fink of the Buildings Department said that in many cases a homeowner has the right to build up to the property line, even if the work covers his neighbor's windows.

Another Duplex for Grasso

The surge in November was to the second-highest monthly total ever, trailing the $105.1 billion figure reached in May 2003.

Perhaps the most intriguing change came in the Caribbean countries, where many hedge funds are based for tax reasons.
After being heavy buyers of Treasury securities early in the year, they were net sellers of $22.2 billion in November, cutting their holdings to $76.2 billion.
Many analysts have argued that one reason Treasury yields have remained relatively low is that hedge funds have been borrowing at low short-term interest rates and using the money to buy higher-yielding Treasury securities.
As long as short-term rates do not rise abruptly, the hedge funds are able to make a profit.

The data indicates that in November a lot of the hedge funds may have decided to bail out of these so-called carry trades, and that helped push the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note up to 4.41 percent on Dec. 2, from 4.02 percent at the end of October.
The yield has since fallen to 4.18 percent.

While the amounts paid to retiring workers would not change immediately, some companies would have to increase their reported pension liabilities as much as 30 percent.
To bring things back into balance, some may contribute more money to their pension funds -- a boon to participants, but a jolt to shareholders, who may have thought that the money would be used for business operations.
Other companies may delete attractive features from their plans, to bring the cost back down.
There is precedent for such a cutback.
Indeed, the accounting board's proposal comes as the pension system itself is under pressure.
Many companies, citing the burden of providing retirement benefits, have cut back, converted or closed their plans.
At the same time, the Bush administration is proposing changes in both the way companies set aside money to pay for future benefits, and the way they pay to support the federal system of insuring traditional pensions.
Business groups have warned that if companies are pushed too hard, they may stop offering pensions altogether.

The looming changes in accounting rules are expected to be strongly opposed by companies.
The staff of the Financial Accounting Standards Board hopes to present the draft of a proposal by the end of March.

"That's where a lot of people are going to be giving us a lot of pushback," Mr. O'Callaghan said.
The accounting board is grappling with something of an open secret in American business: the current accounting rules for pensions allow companies to underestimate, if not conceal, their liabilities legally.

The board's efforts to improve reporting mirror recent administration proposals to overhaul the rules that companies follow in funding their pension plans.
Both sets of rules are now widely thought to obscure the economic reality of a pension plan, sometimes allowing insolvency to grow, undetected by all but the best-informed insiders.
It thus went for several years without making any contributions.
Now, however, the company is arguing in bankruptcy court that it can no longer fund the plans and that the government must take them over.
The particular issues that the accounting board is looking at represent only "a sliver" of the overall problem of pension accounting, Mr. O'Callaghan said.

Other experts agreed.
"They're trying to repair a broken heating system in a house that's falling down," said Jeremy Gold, a consulting actuary to the Financial Accounting Standards Board and an economist who has criticized current pension accounting rules.
"They're headed in the right direction.
They're sending some signals about what a rewrite of the pension rules is going to look like."

Even so, the board may have a fight on its hands.
If it approves its staff's proposal, public comment will then be solicited.
The board has set a year-end target to put the rule into effect, but issues raised in the comment period could take months to sort out, pushing that deadline back.
"Nothing gets done here fast," Mr. O'Callaghan said, recalling that it took more than 10 years to complete a rule on accounting for stock options.
In that case, Congress weighed in, threatening to reduce the board's funds.
The board, based in Norwalk, Conn., also gets contributions from business and accounting firms.

Its current project was initially supposed to change the way companies calculate the value of a kind of pension plan known as a cash-balance plan.
Thousands of companies, employing millions of people, have one or the other of these two types of pension plans.
Lucent Technologies, I.B.M., Avon Products, AT&T, Colgate-Palmolive, Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba America, Wells Fargo, Qwest Communications, Bank of America, Cummins and Delta Air Lines are among the hundreds of companies with cash-balance pension plans.

Delphi and U.S. Steel are among many companies that have conventional pension plans, allowing departing workers to take lump sums.
So do American Airlines and Delta with the pension plans for their pilots.
A cash-balance plan is a hybrid design, combining features of a conventional defined-benefit pension plan with those of a 401(k) plan.
The company sets aside money to pay the benefits in a pooled trust fund, as it would for a traditional pension plan.
But it provides each worker with regular statements, reporting the amount of benefits as an individual account balance, like a 401(k) balance.
There are, in fact, no individual accounts, but expressing the benefits this way is said to make employees understand and value them more.

Each year, an employee's balance increases, as the sponsoring company credits the account with interest at some specified rate.
Often, the rate is linked to a conservative market rate, like that for Treasury bills.
At AT&T, for example, the cash-balance plan has recently been offering employees interest credits at 4 percent a year.

The discrepancy in accounting arises when the company calculates the total value of these obligations for its annual report.
It must again factor in an interest rate, because pension values vary inversely with interest rates, much as bond prices do.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But in this calculation, the crediting rate is not used.
The current accounting standard for pensions lets companies use a high-quality bond rate instead.
AT&T used 6 percent, according to its annual report for 2003.
It is the difference between these rates that troubles the accounting rule makers.
Because of the inverse relationship, using 6 percent produces a smaller pension value for the annual report than the one reported to workers in their statements.

Actuaries say that correcting the reported value in AT&T's case would mean increasing it by about 24 percent, citing a rule of thumb that every percentage-point change in the interest rate causes about a 12 percent change in the value of the benefits.
Conforming to the accounting board's approach might require increasing the amount owed to active workers by 24 percent, or $614 million.
That would increase AT&T's total pension debt to its work force to about $10.6 billion.
These adjustments would vary at different companies, depending on the interest rates used and the ages of the work force.

The accounting board's work on cash-balance plans showed that companies also use two interest rates when calculating lump-sum distributions, with the result that they have also been reporting smaller pension obligations to investors than the amounts workers are really allowed to take.
About half of all workers at big companies are currently allowed to take lump sums, according to Mark G. Beilke, director of employee benefits research at Milliman USA.
The practice is much more common among plans for salaried white-collar workers than those for union or hourly workers, he said.
Among the companies affected because they offer cash-balance plans or pay lump sums, some, like Toshiba and Wells Fargo, have written letters to the accounting board expressing opposition to the accounting change.

"The board's tentative conclusions could result in large charges to earnings for many companies," wrote Richard D. Levy, the controller of Wells Fargo, in a letter sent in May 2004.
"These companies could conceivably implement changes to their pension plans to minimize the impact of the accounting changes on their financial results.
These plan changes may ultimately result in reductions of pension benefits for employees."
Some, including I.B.M., Qwest and Colgate-Palmolive, did not respond to requests for comment.

Many actuaries find the accounting board's new approach disturbing, because it challenges core concepts of the actuarial approach to pensions.
Years ago, cash-balance plans were marketed to companies on the very feature the accounting board now considers incorrect: the interest-rate differential that made them look cheaper than they turn out to be.
"There is substantial leverage in this assumption," said a 1985 promotional brochure on cash-balance plans by Kwasha Lipton, an actuarial firm that has become a part of Mellon Financial.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"A '5 percent of pay' plan might require a contribution of only 4 percent of pay, after a realistic investment differential is taken into account."
When Kwasha Lipton was writing this, that's what all actuaries believed.
The right answer was to say that you could give $5 at the cost of $4."
Correction: January 27, 2005, Thursday Because of an editing error, a front-page article last Thursday about a proposal by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that would require many companies to give a more accurate financial picture of their pension plans misstated the source of the group's financing.
Since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, the board has received funds through mandatory fees charged to many publicly traded companies; it no longer receives voluntary contributions from companies or accounting firms.

What did he look like?
A hero, of course.
With part of its nose missing, it depicts an idealized youthful face, with deep-set eyes and a shaggy mass of hair fronted by the cowlick over the right eye, a hallmark of Alexander's features.
Another marble head, from the early third century B.C., is a little more emotive, showing the king with the same cowlicked hair mass, but with a slightly open mouth and the characteristic tilt of the neck he was said to exhibit.
His likenesses -- the most famous, by Lysippos, has not been found -- may have given a leonine quality to his head not only to impart a godlike appearance, but also to offset his average stature.
In winning the many battles of his campaign, Alexander was helped enormously by the superior quality of Greek weapons, developed -- the catalog tells us -- in the conviction that warfare was the utmost virtue, and that every citizen should be willing to lay down his life for his land.
And the many battles fought by the Greeks resulted in ever more sophisticated arms and strategies for deploying them.

A display of terra cotta figures, manufactured in Pella in the fourth century B.C.
and the Hellenistic period, gives a good view of the basics of dress among upper- and middle-class women.
Each of two typical figures from the third century B.C.
is shown wearing next to the body a long, close-fitting chiton, of wool or linen, and over it a second garment, a himation, also of wool or linen, that could be draped in various ways.
In both, the hair is long but done up: parted in the middle, drawn to either side in curls and arranged in a bun at the back of the head.
Traces of pink or red pigment linger on the lips and hair.
Fed by abundant gold from Macedonian-controlled mines in the Pangaion area, they were evolving in this era to a point of highly sophisticated craftsmanship.
And there is a good deal of it on display: earrings, rings, bracelets, armlets, necklaces, pendants, medallions and buttons -- many rescued from the graves to which they accompanied their owners -- all attesting that the stuff was no less in demand than it is today.
Although not as interesting or elaborate as later Etruscan jewelry, there are a few dazzlers here.
One is a pair of gold drop earrings topped by elaborate honeysuckle palmettes; dangling from each is a figure of Ganymede being carried off by an eagle.
The spread wings of the eagle, actually Zeus in disguise, form a theatrical backdrop for the figure.

But the most spectacular display is a gold ensemble from the tomb of an unknown noblewoman buried in an important part of the vast cemetery of Aigai, once the Macedonian capital.
Lying in one of the few graves untouched by robbers, she was wrapped in a lavish, gold-embellished shroud, now vanished but leaving in place its copious adornments of jewelry, gold ribbons and rosettes.

The outline of her body, as indicated by the numerous ornaments, is on display in a special case.
Large gold fibulae and pins that held her clothes together; a gold-strap diadem and three gold tubal adornments for her hair; gold-strap earrings; a heavy, gold-beaded necklace and pendant; sandals with silver-covered soles; and many other bedazzlements help make this 1998 discovery remarkable.
These are some of the high points of the show, which, if not the strongest or most definitive exhibition on Alexander and his world, is the kind of display that could tempt a viewer into further explorations.

According to the corporation's proposed 2005 budget, if Medicaid reimbursement rates stay unchanged, and the number of patients remains at 2004 levels, it could be breaking even by the end of the year.
That is a big if, though.
Governor Pataki's 2005 budget proposal, announced on Tuesday, includes $1.1 billion in "cost containment" initiatives aimed at Medicaid, including reductions in reimbursement rates to hospitals and nursing homes.
And since state Medicaid expenditures are matched by the federal government, any effect of Mr. Pataki's reductions would be compounded.
Hospital advocates are also wary of the coming budget proposals from President Bush, who has expressed a desire to curb federal Medicaid costs.
As a "safety net" health care system, the medical center has a higher percentage of poor and uninsured patients than other hospitals in Nassau County.

County and hospital officials say it is too early to tell if Mr. Pataki's budget will make it through the State Legislature.
Without specific details, neither Mr. Kane nor any other official would make predictions about the specific impact of Medicaid cuts, only saying they would oppose them.

Kevin Dahill, president of the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council, said that based on similar cuts and taxes that Mr. Pataki has proposed in the past, the corporation stands to lose around $6 million.
The Nassau county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, has been at the forefront of discussions about Medicaid in New York State, crusading for caps on the share of Medicaid costs that are paid by the counties.

"Merely redistributing the burden is not enough," the governor said.
"The state can no more afford to pay for the current and future costs of Medicaid than counties can."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
To some, the implication was that a push for Medicaid caps is a push for Medicaid cuts.
"I think people concerned about what these cuts will do to the Nassau County Medical Center really need to ask Tom Suozzi what role he played here," said Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan, who is chairman of the State Assembly's health committee.
"Because he has created a lot of the political climate that is generating this volume of cuts."
Mr. Suozzi said that cuts, in principle, are not a bad thing.
"There's no question that in order to reform Medicaid and achieve a cap on the growth at the local level as well as cap the growth at the state level there has to be cost containment," he said, but added that public hospitals, like the Nassau University Medical Center, were entitled to special consideration in putting together a Medicaid budget.
"It's premature to think that after all this success that now because of a speech from the governor that the sky is falling," he said.
"The hospital is stronger than it has been in years."

Arthur A. Gianelli, the deputy county executive for budget and finance, acknowledged the county's awkward position: the governor's proposals could mean millions of dollars in benefits to the county but adversely affect the health care corporation.
"Cooperatively, we can withstand adverse policy changes at the state or federal levels," he said.
Such optimism was nowhere to be found a year ago, when a consulting firm hired by the county released a report concluding that "by virtually any measure, N.H.C.C.
today stands on the brink of financial collapse."

The county has a huge stake in the economic success of the health care corporation; it guaranteed the bond that was issued to get the corporation on its feet in 1999, and if the corporation runs out of money, the county must pay its bills.
This exasperated members of the Civil Service Employees Association, the union that represents most of the corporation's workers, who had been working without a contract since January 2003.
Some critics have charged that the board and some of the upper-level managers of the corporation were appointed or hired for political, not professional, reasons.

In September, the county announced a five-point plan for the hospital's fiscal stability based on the recommendations of the consultant's report.
"While that may have been true 20, 30 years ago, it's certainly not true today.
So what I've looked at it is to say, what's our mission?
And our primary mission is as a safety-net hospital."
The corporation also plans to shut down the 45-year-old A. Holly Patterson nursing home and to build a 480-bed nursing home that would be attached to the hospital.
The strategy also called for various changes in the way day-to-day operations were run, including staffing reductions and some changes in senior management.
As Wednesday's layoffs demonstrate, the difficulties are not over.
"We're a long way from where we can say, 'O.K., we've passed the hump and we're definitely safe,"' said Dr. Rosemarie Guercia, co-director of the Long Island Health Access Monitoring Project.

"In the contract negotiations he's been able to more creative in working with us," she said.
The hospital and the union have tentatively agreed on a new contract, which includes a clause preventing future layoffs unless there is a major shock to the hospital's finances.
Ms. D'Amico expects to bring the contract to the members for a vote in February.
Now that many of the consultant's recommendations have been put into place, the remaining challenge is attracting patients.
Mr. Kane said he was hoping that capital improvements, reduced waiting times and a renewed attention to the outlying community health centers would make the hospital system more accessible.
Officials are also hoping to avoid the bad publicity that has hounded the hospital and nursing home over the past few years.
Along with Mr. Pataki's proposed budget, the patient census, which declined steeply over the last year, is one of those variables that will become clearer in time.
"I'm more optimistic now because I think that Dan Kane and his team are really approaching this professionally," Mr. Kessel said.
But, he added, "I'm going to withhold final judgment."
One of the main talking points in the administration's drive to privatize Social Security is that retirees have nothing to fear.
"If you're a senior receiving your Social Security check, nothing is going to change," President Bush said recently.
Mr. Bush seems to presume that older Americans are indifferent to the future retirement security of their children and grandchildren.
But even taken on its face, the argument does not hold up.
The president promises that under a private retirement scheme, anyone age 55 or older would continue to receive full Social Security benefits.
What he repeatedly fails to mention is that privatization would require some $2 trillion in new borrowing over the next 10 years and an additional $4.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.
That's on top of the trillions that need to be found to cover the costs of Medicare and Medicaid and -- if the president gets his way -- to make this decade's tax cuts permanent.
It's foolhardy to assume that the government could continue to meet all of its obligations, including the payment of Social Security benefits, under such a mountain of debt.
All told, by 2030, when today's 55-year-olds turn 80, the national debt would be as big as the economy itself, according to a calculation by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that uses data from Social Security and the Congressional Budget Office.
To compare, consider that in the last 50 years, national debt has equaled only 38 percent of the economy on average, and that percentage includes the tremendous overhang of debt from World War II.
Large and virtually permanent fiscal imbalances could create severe hardship.
At the least, big and ongoing deficits erode living standards because they reduce the money available for investment in the economy.
At worst, enormous and endless deficits could provoke a loss of investor confidence, leading to higher interest rates and inflation, lower stock and bond prices, less household wealth, less government spending and slower economic growth.
"We understand that deficits matter," he said, insisting that the tight budget Mr. Bush is expected to send to Congress next month should give foreigners and the financial markets the solace they seek.

But should the dollar continue to fall -- if, for example, global investors determined that Mr. Bush did not have the will to hold spending down -- it would not only add to tensions, analysts said.
It might also force up interest rates at home to keep foreigners interested in financing America's need to borrow more than $600 billion a year to cover its gap in the current account.
The current account is the broadest measure of the trade and financial flows into and out of the country.
To be sure, the dollar's fall may never reach crisis levels, and in the last few weeks, after a more or less steady fall of almost 35 percent against the euro and 24 percent against the Japanese yen over the last three years, the dollar has stabilized a bit.
Many experts argue that a further decline, if relatively modest and gradual, is entirely manageable.
Administration officials, along with a number of like-minded economists, contend that the nation's record trade and current account deficits are not particularly worrisome, a reflection more of strong foreign interest in investing in the American economy than any sign of global weakness.

But across Asia and Europe, a wide range of officials and analysts worry that Mr. Bush's economic team may not be up to the challenge of grappling with the issue.
They contend that Washington has retreated from efforts to marshal the biggest economies of the world into a mutual effort at more robust and balanced growth.

Many European politicians and exporters cannot shake the suspicion that the Bush administration, despite its statements supporting a strong currency, has been perfectly happy to watch from the sidelines while the dollar heads down.

At a moment of surging American trade deficits that have reached a record share of economic output, a falling dollar makes American exports more competitive and puts imports from Europe at a particular disadvantage.
"It's hard to tell an entrepreneur to wait two years for a policy to change when he says, 'I've got to deliver my goods tomorrow,"' said Anton Boerner, the president of BGA, the Berlin-based association of wholesalers and exporters.
Mr.
Snow, for his part, paints a vastly different picture of the international economic landscape.
He described the situation as one of America's remaining the economic envy of the world, with the yawning deficits being addressed and little risk that foreigners will rethink the wisdom of lending the United States hundreds of billions of dollars a year to finance the trade gap and to cover the vast borrowing needs of the federal government.

Mr.
Snow suggested some in Europe are seeking a convenient scapegoat, particularly after the tensions over Iraq, to blame for the Continent's own inability to generate stronger growth.

"The current deficit levels are too large," Mr.
Snow said, describing himself as a deficit hawk who sees a chance to cut spending because the American economy is growing again.
"They have to come down, and they will come down."
But deficits aside, he argued, "overwhelmingly the United States is looked at as the model for success."
After years of stagnation in money flowing into the government, "revenues look good," and the turning point will come in a couple of weeks, he said, when Mr. Bush sends a budget to Congress in which "you will see a number of programs that not only don't grow at the rate of inflation, but that decline."

While the budget is a domestic document, assessments of whether it will realistically grapple with the underlying problems and whether Mr. Bush has the political will to push tough measures through Congress may determine whether investors around the world stick with the American economy or head for the exits.
'At a Critical Juncture'
No one knows for sure if the doubts that have already contributed to the dollar's decline will intensify.
Some worry that the markets may conclude that Mr. Bush will put the financing of the Iraq war, military transformation and the costs of revamping Social Security ahead of deficit reduction.

Others fret about the risk that a large, highly leveraged hedge fund or a big bank could be caught betting the wrong way in the markets, touching off a sudden currency sell-off that could have implications for the rest of Mr. Bush's term.

"The projection is that they keep rising," he added, noting that the current account deficit is running over 6 percent of the gross domestic product.

There has not been an economic crisis of significant magnitude since Mr. Bush came to office.
Today the Treasury is regarded as a vastly diminished institution, with comparatively little influence in the White House.

As a result, the weakening dollar, to the minds of many from Hong Kong to Berlin, is a metaphor for a presidency so distracted by national security issues that American economic influence has ebbed.
China Stands Its Ground
Washington's lack of success so far in pressuring China to finally allow its currency to float, or at least appreciate significantly to reflect its vastly stronger economy, is cited as the most striking evidence of Washington's diminished economic influence.
Beijing has used other issues, chiefly the Bush administration's dependence on China to help prevent North Korea's development of nuclear weapons from touching off a wider conflagration, to keep currency demands on the back burner.

China is only one piece of the global economic puzzle.
The lack of interest by Mr. Bush and Mr.
Snow to put together a global accord on currency, akin to the Plaza Accord that Mr. Baker organized in 1985, is viewed as evidence that Washington is content with a downward drift of the dollar.
And there is no one to replace the American role.
"It will be a world of chaos without a center," said Hideo Kumano, a senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
Japan itself, after a decade of downward spiral that seems to be ending, has lost all pretense of assuming the mantle of leadership.
Bush administration officials have a deep skepticism bordering on an outright ideological objection to intervening in the markets.

Certainly China, while growing in leaps and bounds, has neither the capacity nor the interest.
"China has a big population and big economic growth, but it is not a mature economic system yet," Mr. Kumano noted.
"I cannot imagine it replacing Europe or Japan in terms of influence in the world economy.
In such a condition, everyone must cope with a world economy where you cannot rely on America."
For all the worries abroad, the Bush administration sees few signs of stress.
"You don't have any major economy now in recession, and volatility is low," Mr. Taylor said.
"Even inflation is contained in the emerging markets."
But the lesson of the 1990's is that currency crises, like the terror strikes of more recent years, are nearly impossible to predict.
"Financing of the U.S. current account deficit has gone more smoothly than many economists were predicting just a few years ago," wrote Roger M. Kubarych, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan research group.

Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban planning at the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, said apprehension over the subway disruptions could lead to an initial weakening of the real estate market.
But with the average price of a New York apartment now at over $1 million, and with interest rates low and the inventory of available properties bone-dry, the market is likely to bounce back.
"Good housing is always attractive," Mr. Moss said.

Historically there has been no fixed correlation between New York property values and direct access to an express subway stop.
Experts say that proximity to good schools, parks and sushi restaurants -- as well as to transportation -- all weighs on a buyer's mind.
Up-and-coming enclaves like Red Hook, Brooklyn, and 23rd Street between 10th and 12th Avenues are virtually off the subway grid.
"We can be assured that eliminating an amenity for a period of years will not be a plus for any area, but how much of a negative depends on many factors," said Michael H. Schill, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former professor of urban planning at the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.
"If a neighborhood is truly on the fringes," Mr. Schill said, "there might be some worry about isolation."

He added that those most affected would be people wanting to move into a neighborhood.

Brokers, who closely monitor the psychology of property acquisition and have unshakable faith in the lure of homeownership, say that nothing can stop a determined buyer, even if the property is in a changing neighborhood rendered less accessible by the subway disruption like Bedford-Stuyvesant, which has recently had an uptick in sale prices.
"If a gorgeous classic Edwardian town house comes on the market in Stuyvesant Heights and is priced between $500,000 and $600,000, you'd still have a bidding war," said Jerry Minsky, a real estate broker at the Corcoran Group's office in Fort Greene.

Correction: February 3, 2005, Thursday An article last Thursday about disruption in service on the A and C subway lines in New York and its effect on residential real estate values referred incorrectly to the Lafayette Avenue station in Brooklyn.
The current "Hurlyburly" (it was also made into a movie in 1998 starring Sean Penn) doesn't have the same gloss, despite its own quota of hip marquee names, and the characters have been stripped of romanticizing charisma.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That sensibility has never translated as effectively in this director's revivals of more conventional classics ("Present Laughter," "The Three Sisters").
But Mr. Elliott is at the top of his form with "Hurlyburly," approaching it with the same mix of clinical hindsight and in-the-moment immediacy that he brought to last season's revival of Wallace Shawn's 1985 play "Aunt Dan and Lemon."
This perspective again uncovers fresh wellsprings of power in a work that turns out to be more than a period piece.
Mr. Elliott goes further than Mr. Nichols did in releasing the characters' hold on the audience's sympathy.
You may occasionally identify with the toxic figures portrayed here, but only with a sharp wince.
The mythic resonance of Tony Walton's set for the Nichols production -- in which windows framed vistas of a lush, junglelike world -- has been exchanged for the slovenly, airless claustrophobia of Derek McLane's rendering of the home shared by two second-tier casting agents, Eddie (Mr. Hawke) and Mickey (Mr. Hamilton).
Their home is a hangout for friends who want to get stoned, get sloshed, get laid.
They include Phil (Bobby Cannavale), a bit actor of thuggish good looks and combustible temperament, and Artie, a leering, avuncular scriptwriter (Wallace Shawn, the author of "Aunt Dan," who is brazenly cast against type in a role created by Jerry Stiller).
Then there are the women, who are passed around as if they were bongs: Darlene (Ms. Posey), a jittery, chic photographer; Donna (Halley Wegryn Gross), a 15-year-old drifter; and Bonnie (Catherine Kellner), a stripper famous for balloon dancing.

They are all surprisingly long-winded, prone to talking jags filled with big words and big concepts, while their attention spans are conversely short.
This means that conversation among them becomes a freewheeling collision course in which connection is arbitrary and bruising.
And while they are always advising one another on how to improve their lives, the only people they are on intimate terms with are their own individual selves.
It is appropriate that when Phil talks about looking at his estranged wife, he remembers seeing a hostile cloud of fog where her face should be.

These jerks are drawn, by performers and playwright, with such fine-grained artistry and accuracy that they are compulsively watchable, giving the lie to the theory that you have to like characters to be engaged by them.
What the show brings out so well is the fractured consciousnesses of people whose moods are determined by their most recent forms of self-medication.
Halfway through this production, it occurred to me that "Hurlyburly" may be the smartest, and certainly the least sentimental, play ever written about life on drugs.

The speech of these coke-snorting, dope-toking, tequilla-swilling characters is circular, repetitive and shot through with abrupt shifts in attitude.
Yet -- and this is a crucial yet -- we are always aware of an aching emotional and intellectual restlessness, fed by a need for clarity, to use one of Eddie's favorite words, in a muddled, superficial environment.

The characters may be victims of the psychobabble, spiritual mantras and film jargon of the world they inhabit.
But they are also perversely struggling to penetrate their self-induced haze.
The production is propelled throughout by a sense of thwarted energy and a crippled quest for substance.
It makes sense that along with the vials of cocaine and baggies of marijuana, a dictionary is always on hand as a consciousness-promoting tool.
As Eddie puts it, pathetically, he is "trying to maintain a, you know, viable relationship with reality."
He continues: "I'm just trying to make certain I haven't drifted off into some, you know, solitary paranoid system of my own totally unfounded and idiosyncratic invention."
Mr. Hawke's persona has always been part angel, part weasel, and he has never put it to better use than here.
He has let his habitually buff body go soft, and he captures with merciless precision the sense of a sharp mind turning flaccid.
His role is taxingly long, with quicksilver adjustments of tone.
But the only speeches he doesn't pull off are the soliloquies about living in the shadow of the neutron bomb.
(Now, as in 1984, the play could benefit from losing at least a half- hour.)

Ms. Posey, a specialist in gamine neurotics, tones down her usual madcap brightness to create an acute study in self-laceration.
(She and Mr. Hawke, by the way, contribute what is sure to be this season's funniest sex scene.)
And Ms. Kellner steers the raucous Bonnie away from the pitfalls of lame victimhood.
There's a survivalist instinct at work in her, though it can't match the armor of affectlessness so persuasively shaped by Ms.
But the evening's most fully realized portrait in an exceptionally vivid gallery comes from Mr. Hamilton, who memorably created a younger disaffected druggie in Kenneth Lonergan's "This Is Our Youth."
Vain and crisply spoken, Mickey is the only character who keeps up appearances within the disintegration of "Hurlyburly."

He has discovered that a chilled, ironic distance is the best defense amid hotter heads.
While the other characters are drowning in a welter of mixed-up feelings, Mickey practices an advanced form of self-anesthesia.
His cynicism is far beyond that of the others, so far as to verge on the inhuman.
Mickey is the character most likely to be alive 10 years after "Hurlyburly" ends.

The "immobilizer" technology used in the keys has been an enormous success.
Texas Instruments alone has its chips in an estimated 150 million keys.
Replacing the key on newer cars can cost hundreds of dollars, but the technology is credited with greatly reducing auto theft.
-- Early versions of in-key chips were relatively easy to clone, but the Texas Instruments chips are considered to be among the best.
Still, the amount of computing the chip can do is restricted by the fact that it has no power of its own; it builds a slight charge from an electromagnetic field from the car's transmitter.
They were able to buy a tag reader directly from the company, which sells kits for $280 on its Web site.

The researchers discovered a critically important fact: the encryption algorithm used by the chip to scramble the challenge uses a relatively short code, known as a key.
The longer the code key, which is measured in bits, the harder it is to crack any encryption system.

The team wrote software that mimics the system, which works through a pattern of challenge and response.
The researchers took each chip they were trying to clone and fed it challenges, and then tried to duplicate the response by testing all 1,099,511,627,776 possible encryption keys.
Once they had the right key, they could answer future challenges correctly.
Mr. Sabetti of Texas Instruments argues that grabbing the code from a key would be very difficult, because the chips have a very short broadcast range.
The greatest distance that his company's engineers have managed in the laboratory is 12 inches, and then only with large antennas that require a power source.

The Texas Instruments chips are also used in millions of the Speedpass tags that drivers use to buy gasoline at ExxonMobil stations without pulling out a credit card, and the researchers have shown that they can buy gas with a cracked code.

Dr. Wagner said that what graduate students could do, organized crime could also do.
"The white hats don't have a monopoly on cryptographic expertise," he said.
Dr. Rubin said that if criminals did eventually duplicate his students' work, people could block eavesdroppers by keeping the key or Speedpass token in a tinfoil sheath when not in use.

With higher rates, P/E valuations will look a little more costly, and the attractiveness of stocks under the Fed model will decline.
In fact, one reason that stocks seem cheaper now under the Fed model than they did at the end of 2004 is that the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note has fallen.

Several indicators suggest that the demand for stocks is waning.
The number of stocks hitting new highs has fallen, while the number hitting new lows has climbed.
The flagging of investor demand shows up in the flow of money in and out of equity mutual funds.
January is usually a good month for inflows, but that is not the case this year, according to AMG Data Services.
The big outflow, $4.4 billion, was from funds that invest in American stocks.
While the month is not over -- and flows from some big mutual funds that report monthly are not included -- it is possible that January will register the first negative outflow for domestic stock funds since AMG began gathering data in 1992.
These barometers -- which, really, are no more than the market's bones and tea leaves -- can be good measures of the current climate.

"This is going to be a year where the consumer will not be willing to experiment," Mr. Cohen predicted.
"They'll pay what they want to, for what they want, and go home with their purchases and enjoy them."
Mr. Cohen, citing interviews that NPD conducted after the holidays, said consumers "are still splurging, but with care, and most often, on the so-called aspirational, or accessible, luxury items" -- those that bear a chic brand name but cost less than other chic names.

As it is currently conceived, the route will cut across Garden Valley, within ear- and eyeshot of Heizer's sculpture and the ranch right next to it where he lives, a kind of survivalist compound of cinder block and solar panels, an oasis of cottonwoods and wild plum trees in the middle of a wide, empty plain.
Having moved long ago to this virtual end of the earth, and having also moved heaven and earth to build in isolation his immense sculpture, Heizer now finds the federal government is plotting, as he sees things, to ruin it and him.
Heizer knows it's highly unlikely that he or anyone else will suddenly stop Yucca cold, but he says he's hoping at least to persuade Department of Energy officials at this 11th hour to redirect the tracks next door through Coal Valley and Murphy Gap.
Of course he is deeply pessimistic.
"I've always been a pessimist," he tells me, "but now I think things are going to get really, really bad."
Squinting into a fresh plume of cigar smoke, which rises like a dark cloud around him, he starts imagining first the rail, then wells, then electric power lines invading the valley, while "sniveling toady" politicians, as he calls them, do nothing.
His soliloquy crescendos, linking defense contractors like Kellogg Brown & Root and Bechtel to the government as a sinister cabal machinating against him -- "I wouldn't be surprised if they sent out a hit squad to kill me!"
-- when the silence of Murphy Gap is suddenly shattered by a heart-stopping boom.

At 60, with hawkish steel gray eyes, a kind of wary stare, a deeply lined face and haphazardly combed-over hair, Heizer is still gaunt from a decade-long battle with a neurological disorder that left him weak and in crippling pain.
The knowledge that the government or his body or both could prove his work's undoing makes him more fierce at the same time that he seems swallowed up in his clothes: dusty khakis, a checked vest over a plaid shirt, a sheepskin hat with earflaps and cowboy boots.
He affects the look of other ranchers in this hardscrabble stretch of range, a resemblance that partly belies his upbringing.
Born in Berkeley, Calif., Heizer comes from an accomplished family of academics, geologists and miners with some history in Nevada, a history that he's proud of and that explains how he ended up making art here.
In the early 60's, Claes Oldenburg, Carl Andre and Walter De Maria were digging holes or talking about digging holes, making performances out of the process.
De Maria was imagining milelong parallel walls in the desert, and Robert Smithson was mapping the New Jersey landscape, visiting quarries, making "Nonsites" out of rocks he collected and conceptualizing Earth Art, which became a catchall term for disparate experiments.
It was an era of chest-thumping, clashing personalities, proclaiming to remake art from scratch, and Heizer fitted right in.
Negative sculpture, as Heizer called art made out of the space left behind from digging, crept into the mainstream consciousness, even if many people have never heard of him.
Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the memorial design for ground zero are both riffs, in part, on Heizer's negative vocabulary.

His best-known work was "Double Negative," for which he cut a 1,500-foot-long, 50-foot-deep, 30-foot-wide gash onto facing slopes of the Mormon Mesa in Nevada by blasting and scraping away 240,000 tons of rock.
Smithson, as Heizer sees it, "just copied my M.O., did a complete heavy borrowing, an identity theft."
Over the years, most of Heizer's friendships with artists he knew then have fallen away.
It was to be experienced over time, in shifting weather, not from a single vantage point or from above but as an accumulation of impressions and views gathered by slowly walking through it.
Artists in the 1960's and 70's -- Donald Judd, Andre, De Maria, Smithson, others -- were pushing sculpture off its pedestal.
Artists have always had assistants.

"City," in its vastness, was meant to synthesize ancient monuments, Minimalism and industrial technology.
Heizer resists such strict comparisons, stressing his basic abstract impulses.
"The trouble is," he explained to me, "once you say something about a source, then you've pegged it down, and so now I'm reluctant to say anything.
If I say I developed 50 different shapes from Mississippian tumuli, that doesn't mean they're copies of tumuli -- I'm not ripping off those shapes.
I said I derived some of the shapes from the serpent motif at Chichén Itzá, and now I have to live with this forever, as if that's the whole meaning behind it."
That might mean Eskimos or Peruvians.
Whatever its sources, in its ambition and idiosyncrasy, it is clearly a very eccentric, American vision.

During the mid-1950's, the National Academy of Sciences raised the question of what should be done with the country's radioactive military waste.
"Part of my art," Heizer explained when he picked Garden Valley, "is based on an awareness that we live in a nuclear era.
We're probably living at the end of civilization."
At the same time, it was inspired, Heizer said, by what he calls the ceremonial city: "Every old city has the same sort of ceremonial feature, whether it's the Tuileries or St. Peter's or Teotihuacán.
The long, stretched-out format of my sculpture is in dialogue with this ancient way of formatting space."

Heizer also designed "City" to blend into the contours of the valley and to act as a kind of bunker or container, open to the sky but dug into the earth, low to the ground (he admires Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings) and, as much as possible, disguised from outside, so that the natural vista would be largely preserved.

The military metaphor of the bunker, with its defensive aura, is hard to miss.
Years ago, Heizer compared the first part of "City" -- a sloped, flat-topped mound with projecting beams that he called Complex One -- to a blast shield.
He has since constructed pits and perimeter mounds, turning his work into a sort of airy, roaming fortress made of millions of yards of dirt, so many yards by now that he long ago lost count.
"It is connected to the environment but not to the landscape.
Landscape to me is a planar thing, just a view.
Environment is everything down to the ecosystem.
Big difference."
Ten years after Heizer conceived "City," Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which insisted that the Department of Energy find deep geological disposal sites -- and also that the United States must permanently dispose of spent fuel from nuclear reactors, not reuse it, which meant that there would be less dangerous plutonium floating around in the world, but more waste to dispose of.

By then, Heizer had reached an impasse on "City."
He finished Complex One in 1974, mostly working by himself, using a paddle-wheel scraper a farmer lent him and following plans drawn up by seismic engineers; then he started on Complexes Two and Three, gargantuan mounds that proved to be vastly more troublesome.
"I never stopped working on the pit and the Complexes, whenever I could afford to.
But we're talking crazy optimism here."
In 1995, he mistook pain in his fingers and toes for frostbite because he had been standing in the cold 12 hours a day working on his sculpture.
"I thought I was eternal," Heizer told me one evening, relaxing after dinner in his living room, flexing his hands while staring absently at the Science Channel.
"I still do.
For a while he couldn't walk, then he had to use crutches.
If he'd never gotten to those, he would still have accomplished a feat on a scale not unlike, say, Mount Rushmore, which, along with the cowboy paintings of Charles Russell and Frederic Remington, is just about the only American art Heizer now volunteers to praise.
Two Remington cowboy sculptures are on either end of the long table in his living room, and he keeps handy an old book of Russell's paintings of the West.
"I love these artists because they're so precise and faithful," he says.
I couldn't decipher the work at first, save for a few distinctive shapes.
The additions now dwarf the first phase of the project, making
Complexes One, Two and Three, which are collectively nearly the size of Yankee Stadium, look tiny and precious.
The new phases are more pneumatic -- raked dirt formations resembling hills, valleys and mountains.
There is a patch of unspoiled sage, like a park, smack in the middle, for flood runoff through the valley (Heizer was thrilled to discover that it actually worked during the recent January storms); and there's now a concrete sculpture, "45ö, 90ö, 180ö," which both evokes ancient Egypt and resembles a board game on the scale of an airport hangar.
"I call it a defracted gestalt," Heizer said while slowly steering the truck to the steep precipice of what he calls Alpha mound.
"From the ground you grasp the size but can't make out the shapes -- the opposite of what you sense from the air -- and your perception changes as you move around."
Heizer occasionally refers to the valley as virgin land; he obsesses about the originality of his conception, about protecting his property and his art from violation by the rail, from developers hunting for underground water, from people trying to sneak in to see the sculpture before it's finished.
His project is propelled by anger and resentment and monomania but also by Eros: sculpture as voluptuous, unspoiled and ecstatic, an organic body (one mound from the air, I saw, clearly resembles an erect phallus).

The question, at a time when there's so little talk about government financing for new art of any sort, is whether a country that claims to prize its rugged individualists and its native treasures, both natural and cultural, will care enough to try to avoid "City" by running the nuclear train elsewhere -- whether accommodations will be made simply to preserve a sculpture and the equally obscure, awesome valley it occupies.

Obscure, in the art's case, not just because it's physically remote, but also because Heizer has frightened away almost everyone from seeing "City."
He's the opposite of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, whose "Gates," to be unveiled this week in Central Park in New York -- another gigantic sculpture project decades in the making -- is ephemeral.
Christo and Jeanne-Claude regard the public spectacle of their installation as part of the work itself: the art is a kind of temporary performance.
Only when "City" is finished -- Heizer predicts it could take another decade to complete the 15 miles of concrete curbs that delineate the mounds and shore up the dirt slopes -- will the public be invited.
Meanwhile, as he kept insisting to me while we were bumping down what sufficed for the path through Murphy Gap, anyone trying to show up uninvited will be arrested for trespassing or shot at.
Then I heard gunshots.
It's a message, he speculated.
Like him, he said, they just want to be left alone.

Heizer's ranch is a three-hour drive north of two million people in Las Vegas, but it's an hour's drive from almost anyone.
His driveway is an unmarked dirt road meandering across several empty valleys and mountain ranges, more than an hour from blacktop.
He rarely leaves the ranch these days, and hardly anyone visits except the construction crew.
Heizer's Garden Valley is in Lincoln County, which, like half of Nevada, is a place where ranchers run cattle up-country during the spring and summer, down-country during the winter.
This is mountainous range.
Gold miners used to prospect here; there is still mining for opal and vermiculite.
They're raising beefalo.
They also grow alfalfa.
Their house is simple, comfortable, a low two-story building with a big kitchen in front.
There's a metal shop, a dog kennel, a bunkhouse for workers to sleep in overnight, pens for cattle and farming equipment scattered along with half-finished sculptures in the yard.

Mary, although she's from Michigan, is a Western classic, soft-spoken and steady.
She can birth a calf, make plum jam, change a truck tire, help oversee the complicated accounting on the project, ride herd over construction workers and ranch hands, format the digital images of the sculpture on the computer, reprogram electronics for the testy solar panels and in her spare time retreat to a studio behind Heizer's office and paint abstract pictures of an ethereal calm and Western light.
She's in charge of the herd.
The plan is to keep expanding it, she said.
She and Heizer live pretty much like many small-time ranchers in their elective isolation.
He's just the only guy around building the equivalent of the ancient pyramids in his front yard.
Lincoln County is Mormon country, where ranching families go back to the 1800's, people don't like the government telling them what to do and outsiders are regarded with suspicion.
One evening I discovered Mary and Heizer laughing in the living room.
The dozen or so men who now work with him -- several of whom trek hundreds of miles each week across the desert to accommodate Heizer's sudden decisions to shift several hundred thousand yards of dirt a few inches this way or that -- profess deep affection.
He's a perfectionist; they shrug.

If Heizer, over the years, picked fights and lost allies, insisting, against common sense, he was the first, the only, the best artist around, clearly some people have stuck loyally by him.
"The people who really spend time with him love him," says Michael Govan, who, along with Lynne Cooke, Dia's longtime curator, visits maybe three or four times a year to check on the sculpture's progress.
"Never a nickel gets spent on anything that's not necessary," Govan adds.
"If Mike weren't managing the construction and we had used outside contractors, it would have cost double, I'm sure.
He's honorable."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The patrons Govan has enlisted -- the Lannan Foundation, the Riggio family and the Brown Foundation, the same Browns, by the way, of the defense contractor Kellogg Brown, which Heizer said was scheming to bump him off -- have stuck with a project that could cost nearly $25 million by the end.
"Mike does things how he wants," says J. Patrick Lannan Jr., the foundation's president.
"But it's going to be a monumental gift to culture for generations to come."
Even Heizer is astonished: "I told them they're playing with fire.
I'm an artist.
I don't work with drawings or models.
This is a creative process.
It's an act of faith on their part."
Later he dug up a passage from the book and e-mailed it to me:
"During all these months the Pope kept insisting that Michelangelo complete his ceiling quickly, quickly!
'When will it be finished?'
" 'When I have satisfied myself.'
" 'Satisfied yourself in what?
You have already taken four full years.'

" 'In the matter of art, Holy Father.'
" 'It is my pleasure that you finish it in a matter of days.'
" 'It will be done, Holy Father, when it will be done.'
Heizer figures that when his own work is done, it will be there for anybody to see for centuries -- that he's building not for today but for the ages.
It's a perspective he came by naturally.

Preserved in a file cabinet in Heizer's office is a page from The San Francisco Chronicle, dated Dec. 17, 1941.
It's a picture of a slender, youngish Robert holding a box of 350-year-old rusty iron spikes that bound the oaken ribs of a sunken Spanish explorer ship.
A 1946 newspaper cartoon of Robert is tucked in the same folder.
He's depicted as a bespectacled Indiana Jones in tie and tweed jacket, brandishing a skull before a pile of bones.
Some of the mounds in "City," it occurs to me when I see the cartoon, are shaped like bones, and the stelae are a bit like the spikes.

In front of Heizer's house there is also a gigantic perforated sculpture resembling Swiss cheese.
Heizers have been in or around Nevada since the 1880's.
(A family story, Heizer says, is that one of Olaf's horses was used by Eadweard Muybridge for his stop-action photographs.)
My father admitted to me later that he'd thought I would come to no good.
He supported himself working for slumlords, lugging a compressor over the cobblestone streets in SoHo, hooking up a spray gun and painting a six-story building top to bottom (white in the rooms, brown in the stairwells) in a day.
"I met Walter De Maria painting his loft.
These served almost as diagrams for the sculptures he would make in the earth.
Much of that first outdoor work was fleeting, almost provisional, the opposite of "City."
He has changed over the years, as a result of defending himself from attacks, real or imagined.
"When I visited at first Mike was living in a trailer and had a big young Mormon working for him," Dwan recalls.

Eventually he built himself a house out of cinder-block seconds.
"There he is in the middle of nowhere, without an art world to talk to, without a bar where he can go find friends for support, building something much larger than anyone has ever built, knowing he is going to be criticized for grandiosity, and yet going ahead and building what he must.
That takes courage."
Heizer still commuted to New York and Los Angeles, doing commissions, networking.
"They're frivolous, I'm not," he told me.
"You don't control your own destiny in New York.
It's fine if you trust the system and agree to move along the street in an orderly fashion.
But you can't carry a weapon to protect yourself, even though it's more dangerous there than here.
I find it castrating."
And when you look at the old photographs of us, you can see the joy in our faces."

That was then.
Should the rail go through, Heizer now claims, he'll dynamite "City," never mind that he is building it to be indestructible for thousands of years, or that the people giving him money aren't likely to fork over another million or so dollars to destroy it and return the desert to its original condition.
But with him, it has become all or nothing.
Posterity isn't the next generation; it's a millennium.
"Double Negative" was "the most incredible sculpture I've ever seen or done," Heizer says.
I knew I'd done it.

And he did not just add his sensibility to radical art movements of the 60's and 70's.
As he sees it, he single-handedly, without influence from any other living artist, started a "revolution."
"I'm self-entertaining," he declares in another fervid soliloquy.
"My dialogue is with myself."
The sculptor Richard Serra, Heizer's contemporary, who was an acquaintance of Heizer's during the 60's and whose own work sometimes now rivals Heizer's in size, has said: "Whoever tells you he dropped from heaven knows the opposite is equally true."
Serra hasn't seen "City," but he told me that he could imagine "the work may empower people in ways that don't have to do with scale, in ways that we can't foresee.
Heizer's stance is empowering because what artists do is individuate themselves, and this guy has done it to the nth degree."
Of course, Heizer is not really on his own in the desert, as the nuclear train proves.
We were in his kitchen with Gracian Uhalde, his nearest neighbor, who has a ranch about 15 miles away and who works as a contractor on "City."
We sat before cups of strong espresso that Heizer likes to serve in glass tumblers at the table his father built for him years ago out of mining timbers scavenged from some abandoned mine shafts in the Golden Gate Range.
The MX plan was to crisscross Garden and other nearby valleys -- Coal, Dry Lake, Delamar -- with rail tracks leading to silos for moving around and hiding missiles.
"Now they're back at it."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
When I found Uhalde working at "City" later that same morning, he moseyed over, stomping his feet against the bitter cold, and slid a pinch of chewing tobacco into his cheek.
In his early 50's, he has a broad, well-creased face, partly hidden behind a huge white handlebar mustache.
Heizer calls him a cowboy, a small-time rancher, which to Heizer is a big compliment.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"People are here because we want to be here, because we're attached to this place," Uhalde said.
"You don't come to Lincoln County to make it in the world."
Like Heizer, he has become outspoken against the Yucca rail plan, which he fears will destroy his cattle's grazing land.
Uhalde went on: "Now we have about 10,000 acres altogether, between the ranch here and one up north, and we farm about 150 acres for hay and have a couple thousand sheep plus 600 cows.
We've been around for 100 years.
Uhalde had been carrying it around lately.
It showed cartoons of bowlegged cowboys on the range, watching mushroom clouds rise over the mountains.
Allowing that "fallout can be inconvenient," it provides helpful tips like opening windows to avoid shock waves, wearing sunglasses if staring at fireballs and brushing off clothing when covered with radioactive dust.
Deer started showing up with burn patches.
We would try to figure out where the pink clouds were heading.
"Then in the late 80's my sister started having symptoms.
Around then I got a tumor growing in my bladder.
We both applied for downwinders' compensation.
"Now we say, just leave us alone and take your nuclear glow train through some other valley, along the highway or whatever.
Just not here.
Here you've got ranching -- small-time, old-style ranching, with the valley as a natural, reusable resource -- coexisting in peace with Mike's project, a cultural monument.
The rail will kill all that."
"The train is just part of the problem," he said.
"Developers want to rape this place."
Railroad Valley, just next to Garden Valley, has oil wells and a refinery in it, Uhalde added.
Is there oil in this valley?
"God, I hope not," he said.
The Bureau of Land Management, which controls public lands, meaning most of Garden Valley, issued what's called a temporary segregation to reserve the rail route.
Next will come an Environmental Impact Statement.
The department plans to issue a draft of what it calls the "Rail Alignment Environmental Impact Statement" by late spring or early summer.
After that come hearings and another chance for public response before the final E.I.S.
is issued and the fate of the rail line is decided sometime early in fiscal year 2006, Davis said.

"We have several laws to comply with," Gene Kolkman added.
He is field manager for the B.L.M.
in nearby Ely and oversees land withdrawal.
If the rail line intersects free roaming area for wild horses, that will require modifications because the horses are protected by the Wild Horse and Burro Act.
Ranchers must be compensated if the rail cuts off grazing lands and harms their livelihood.
"It's very seldom that a project comes in, especially a controversial project like the Yucca Mountain railroad line, and that it ends up being authorized as it was originally configured," Kolkman said.
A former Energy Department consultant on Yucca who is rooting for Heizer's plan to move the route to another valley (and so who asked not to be identified by name) nonetheless defended the selection of Yucca.
No site is perfect, he said.
But he acknowledged the problem of shipping the waste to Yucca.
Spent fuel contains heavy metals, and they aren't called heavy for nothing.
They require massive rail containers for transport.
Cement for constructing the storage site must also be carried to it, tons of cement, on the scale of Hoover Dam.
This is to be one of the largest public work projects ever.
The shortest route would skirt Las Vegas, but the more politically feasible path -- and the one mapped by the Department of Energy -- goes from Caliente through the middle of nowhere, which is to say, right through Michael Heizer's front yard.
Politics has trumped art, the consultant said, at least for the moment.
"Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel," the 1939 classic by Virginia Lee Burton, is about Mike Mulligan and his red steam shovel, Mary Anne.
They quit the big city, frustrated because steam shovels were succeeded by electric and diesel shovels, and they find work in the countryside.
In faraway Popperville, they dig a cellar for a new town hall but, in their haste, they forget to leave a way out.
They end up entombed in the cellar, Mike as the janitor, Mary Anne as the furnace.
Heizer says he loved the story so much as a boy that his mother used to call him Mike Mulligan.
Hicks has the chapped lips and weathered face of a cowboy who has spent his life in the great Western outdoors.
He has been working on "City" for years.
He told me he makes the daily commute across the mountains and the desert from Ely, two hours each way, to work 10-hour shifts on this project.
"I can't sleep anyway, so why not drive?"
he said, laughing.
Like the other men, he enjoys working for Heizer.

"I've worked on an airport runway and on highways," he said, "where you've got big crews; the bosses flood the projects with equipment, nothing's complicated, you know beforehand the shape and the curve or whatever.
This is completely different, 180 degrees."
How so?
He nodded toward Beta Mound, an immense, quarter-mile-long construction of dirt with sloping sides, a flat top and a rounded nose.
Maybe you wouldn't notice, but somebody will.
And that will last hundreds of years."

When I came across Bill Harmon, who pours concrete for the curbs, he echoed what Hicks said about discovering, in the process of building "City," an American can-do ideal, the fine art of heavy construction.
Harmon is from Ruby Valley, 230 miles north, and during the week he lives in a trailer at Uhalde's ranch across the valley with six other guys working on the project, including his two sons, Clint and Bo.

"Mike is demanding," he said.
"But that's why things are as good as they are.
I've worked in concrete all my life, and I've never had the time or money to do something to the best of my ability.
Everything is hurry up.
It's about making money.
That's the American way.
But here we have to produce something that has more to do with accuracy than I've ever been allowed even to imagine.
This here is my chance to do the best I can.
I travel over 400 miles a week just to be here.
And my boys take pride in it, too.
When it's finished, I'll be able to say, I had the chance to do that."
I asked him what he thinks the sculpture is about.
"It's hard to explain," he added.
I could not see why we were doing this.
Were we going to live in it?

"But gradually I got the idea.
I can't say exactly what it means now, but I know it has to do with history and with making something that will last.
I'm not an artist, but I can tell you I'm real proud to be working on something like this."
"It takes a while to get used to how Mike does things.
But we admire him because he's not afraid to be different.
And we're glad for him.
It's not too many people in life get to see their dream come true, is it?"
Roaming antelope and coyote hunting for rabbits had made the dogs bark at night.
So much of Heizer's hubris is bravado, I think -- his not having enough people around to vent to, to talk back to him.
And in the end the work, which possesses him and drives him and other people crazy, is the only thing that will count -- if it isn't spoiled by the nuclear rail line or if Heizer doesn't blow it up first.
"They're crap," he said.
"They'll blow out if you hit a big rock, and then you'll be stuck."
With that, I drove off, tires crunching in the cold gravel, as the first rays of sun hit the snow on the mountains, casting the valley in a pearly gray pool of winter light.

While the decline was modest -- to 3.98 percent from 4.02 percent on Tuesday -- the move below the symbolic level of 4 percent highlighted the peculiar nature of the recent rally in Treasury securities: long-term interest rates have been held down even as the Federal Reserve has steadily pushed short-term rates up.

But a growing number of Republicans, anxious about plans to partially privatize Social Security, are now pushing Mr. Bush to combine that goal with tax overhaul.

"We can deal with Social Security and taxes simultaneously," said Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, in a speech last month.
"Sometimes, the more you include in a piece of legislation, the easier it is to pass."
The potential advantage of marrying the two agendas, many lawmakers say, is to win maneuvering room to write legislation that would appeal to Democrats and have a chance of becoming law.
But the risk could be a huge political logjam.
Mr. Bush's plan for Social Security could be bogged down for years if it became stuck in a lobbying battle between tax-reform winners and losers.
"I would not want to see us deflect attention" from Social Security, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said at a recent Congressional hearing.

Many House Republicans have been pushing for a fundamental tax overhaul.
Lawmakers have introduced numerous bills over the last year that would replace today's system of progressive tax rates with a flat income tax or a national sales tax.

Other Republicans, including many of Mr. Bush's advisers, would seek the same goal but from the opposite direction.
Instead of taxing sales, the government would embark on a series of seemingly incremental changes that eliminated taxes on savings and investment income.
Eventually, people would be taxed only on what they spend.

Mr. Bush has signaled strongly that he does not favor the most radical solutions that some Republicans have advocated for years.
The deduction for mortgage interest, for example, would be meaningless in a system based on a national sales tax.
The mortgage tax break, which costs the Treasury about $72 billion a year, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, would also undermine a basic goal of a flat income tax: to offer a lower tax rate in exchange for eliminating traditional tax breaks.
On top of that, Mr. Bush has asked the panel to prevent a huge expansion of the so-called alternative minimum tax -- a tax that was originally aimed at the nation's wealthiest households but is now engulfing millions of additional families as incomes rise with inflation each year.

Freezing the alternative minimum tax would cost the government about $500 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

"It's going to be a difficult assignment," said John B. Breaux, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana who is co-chairman of Mr. Bush's tax advisory panel.
The group meets for the first time on Wednesday.
"There's a pretty strong consensus that we want to do something about the alternative minimum tax.
But any time we look to eliminate a feature of the code that raises revenues, we'll have to find something else to raise revenues that replaces it."
"It will make things harder," he said.

The basic political problem is in balancing the winners and losers in any comprehensive tax code change.
"It's a lot easier to get something through Congress when all you're saying is 'Let's cut taxes,"' said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research organization based in Dallas.
"But when you are talking about a reform agenda, that implies trade-offs.
And we haven't seen them do that."

Simplifying the tax code would pose difficult choices about some popular tax breaks, including several that President Bush expanded during his first term.
In addition to the mortgage interest deduction, other breaks that might be considered include these:

In many respects, the challenges today are more daunting than those that faced President Ronald Reagan when he led a bipartisan tax overhaul in 1986.
That change lowered the top tax rates and created a much flatter rate structure, paying for lower rates by eliminating scores of special tax breaks.

Both a flat tax and a consumption tax would probably shift more of the tax burden from high-income households to middle- and lower-income taxpayers.
That is because the top 10 percent of income earners, those who earn more than roughly $100,000 a year, currently pay about 65 percent of all federal income taxes.
One-third of all American households pay no federal income tax at all.

In 1996, the Treasury Department estimated that the nation would need a flat income tax of 20.8 percent to fully replace the progressive rates of the income tax for individuals and the corporate income tax.
If a flat tax were imposed, tax exemptions for middle- and lower-income families could protect many from automatic tax increases, but analysts say it would be very difficult to prevent some of the tax burden from shifting from the wealthiest households to those with more moderate incomes.
"Systematic reform usually makes those losers more identifiable up front."
"There's still a lot of legwork to be done" on taxes, Mr. Bush said at a news conference two days after the election.
But Republicans who are pushing for a tax code overhaul, including many House lawmakers and many of Mr. Bush's advisers, have argued for years that the system should tax consumption rather than income.
One reason, they contend, is that the current system taxes people who save and invest their income as much as it does people who spend everything they have.

The payroll tax brings in almost as much revenue as the income tax, but it has been widely criticized as regressive, because it is not imposed on annual income of more than $90,000 a year.
Because employers pay half of the 12.4 percent payroll tax, critics say the payroll tax also discourages hiring.

On a drab block of 43rd Street west of Eighth Avenue, Steven C. Witkoff, a real estate investor, bought a garage, a four-story hotel and a third building, where he plans to build a condominium apartment tower.

And now, in large part to compete with the football stadium it is trying to defeat, Cablevision has offered to pay $600 million for the rights to the railroad yard and the construction of a platform above, all to build a complex of housing and office buildings.

"I think the momentum has begun and there'll be an uptick from this point forward," said Harvey Shulweiss, who has owned a large development site at the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 33rd Street since the 1980's.
"The Far West Side is going to be a hotbed of development."

Much of the current interest in the Far West Side is fueled by the seemingly insatiable thirst for housing at any price and the Bloomberg administration's rezoning of the 42-block area for large projects.
The Real Estate Board of New York reports a record-setting number of condominium and cooperatives sold in Manhattan, 3,145 in the third quarter of 2004, more than at any time in the last four years.
And the average sales price of a condominium in Manhattan has soared past $1.2 million, according to the Corcoran Group, a real estate company.
Developers say that interest rates remain low and it is still very easy to finance condominium projects.
"The Far West Side of Midtown is in all probability the last neighborhood in Manhattan with enough critical mass," said Jules Demchick, who is building a 46-story apartment tower on 42nd Street near 12th Avenue.
"It has huge potential because you have the ability to assemble large pieces of land."

"The whole process has drawn attention to the long term value of the public land," said Lynn Sagalyn, a professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania.
"The Cablevision bid has opened up the question of what's the proper price and procedure for capturing the public value."

In comparison to the Cablevision offer, the Jets had offered $100 million, with the city and the state splitting the estimated $375 million cost of a deck.
The M.T.A.
Since the Jets were using about one-third of the estimated development rights, the M.T.A.
asked for $300 million.
But transportation advocates and stadium opponents have claimed that the M.T.A.
should be asking for full value, given that it is contemplating service cuts, fare hikes and a multibillion-dollar gap in its capital budget.
Peter S. Kalikow, the authority's chairman, has said that his board will review the Cablevision offer, while continuing its year-long negotiations with the Jets.

Although the city, the Jets and the Real Estate Board have assailed Cablevision's offer as a spoiler and a public relations event, company executives seem to think they cannot lose, because their offer is still below the value of the yards.

"It's clearly valuable," said a major residential developer, who asked not to be identified.
"But can anyone in my position say so on the record?
Everyone, including me, is scared to cross him on this.

Mr. Shulweiss is ambivalent about the stadium.
"It was the zoning clarification on the far West Side."

"The existence of the stadium," he added, "might accelerate the development of the subway and other infrastructure that would enhance the value of everyone's property."
The state and the city embarked on a plan in 1984 to transform a 13-block area--the same size as the railyards--into neon-infused entertainment and commercial area.
They estimated that it would cost about $40 million to acquire the 42nd Street block between Broadway and Eighth Avenue.
With the lawsuits failing in May 1989, the Dursts threw up another roadblock, buying the leases to the eight historic theaters on 42nd Street that the state's project was intending to revive.

"The volatile story of 42nd Street should make people cautious about land values in a rapidly changing real estate market," said Ms. Sagalyn, author of "Times Square Roulette; Remaking the City Icon."

The implication was that Fed officials, far from being ready to pause in their rate increases, might feel even more need to keep going.

Since last June, the Fed has raised the overnight rate in a series of quarter-point increases to 2.5 percent, from 1 percent.
And credit spreads -- the additional risk premiums that financial institutions demand from riskier borrowers -- have narrowed as well.
Fed surveys of bank lending officers indicate that banks have eased their standards on business loans.
"This development contrasts with most experience," Mr. Greenspan said on Wednesday in his semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
"It will be some time before we are able to better judge the forces underlying recent experience."

One standard theory is that bond investors expect an economic slowdown, which would reduce the demand for money in the future.
But Mr. Greenspan said that explanation "does not mesh" with the rise in stock prices and the narrowing of credit spreads.

A second theory is that foreign central banks were responsible, because they have been buying Treasury bonds and other American securities to keep their currencies cheap in relation to the dollar.

A third explanation is that global investors are simply more confident about the global outlook for inflation and growth than they have been in the past, but there is nothing particularly new in the broader economic outlook to account for a sudden change in behavior.
"For the moment, the broadly unanticipated behavior of world bond markets remains a conundrum," Mr. Greenspan concluded.
Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting concern in Valhalla, N.Y., said, "It is safe to assume that Mr. Greenspan views the overall monetary environment as rather more stimulative than he would have expected."
"Joining the dots," Mr. Shepherdson said, "the message seems to be that if the curve keeps flattening, the Fed will have to push short rates higher than would have otherwise been the case."

On Thursday, Mr. Greenspan will testify before the House Financial Services Committee.
Let me make a detour here.
The way privatizers link the long-run financing of Social Security with the case for private accounts parallels the three-card-monte technique the Bush administration used to link terrorism to the Iraq war.
Speeches about Iraq invariably included references to 9/11, leading much of the public to believe that invading Iraq somehow meant taking the war to the terrorists.
When pressed, war supporters would admit they lacked evidence of any significant links between Iraq and Al Qaeda, let alone any Iraqi role in 9/11 -- yet in their next sentence it would be 9/11 and Saddam, together again.

Similarly, calls for privatization invariably begin with ominous warnings about Social Security's financial future.
When pressed, administration officials admit that private accounts would do nothing to improve that financial future.
Yet in the next sentence, they once again link privatization to the problem posed by an aging population.
He painted a dark (and seriously exaggerated) picture of the demographic problem, and said that what we need is a "fully funded" system.
He then conceded that Bush-style privatization would do nothing to improve the system's funding.
But privatization "as a general model," he said, "has in it the seeds of developing full funding by its very nature."
Nice metaphor, but what does it mean?
Clearly, he was trying to create the impression of links where none exist.

Mr. Greenspan went on to concede that the opponents of privatization are right to worry about the huge borrowing that Bush-style privatization would entail.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Privatizers claim that financial markets won't be disturbed by all that borrowing because the Bush plan prescribes offsetting cuts in guaranteed benefits for the workers who open private accounts.
Mr. Greenspan, who does know a thing or two about markets, put his finger on the reason why those prospective future benefit cuts wouldn't offset current borrowing in the eyes of investors: "Well, the problem is that you cannot commit future Congresses to stay with that."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Yet the chairman managed to avoid admitting the obvious -- that borrowing on the scale the Bush plan requires would substantially increase the risk of a financial crisis.
And the headlines didn't emphasize his concession that crucial critiques of the Bush plan are right.
They acted as if he were still playing his proper role, acting as a nonpartisan source of economic advice.
After the hearing, rather than challenging Mr. Greenspan's testimony, they tried to spin it in their favor.
But Mr. Greenspan is no longer entitled to such deference.
By repeatedly shilling for whatever the Bush administration wants, he has betrayed the trust placed in Fed chairmen, and deserves to be treated as just another partisan hack.

"I just love coming to China," Mr. Elton said while signing one of his books and nearly being pushed over in the frenzy here in Harbin.
"I feel like a rock star here."

Mr. Elton is actually just one of many popular management gurus: experts say the country has a severe shortage of skilled business managers and a growing cadre of people who want to be the next Bill Gates.
So Western management experts -- teaching everything from how to reward employees to how to foster innovation -- are flocking to China, trying to capitalize on this capitalist frenzy.
Big names are coming, like John F. Welch Jr., Stephen R. Covey and Michael E. Porter, a Harvard Business School specialist on competition.
But so are the lesser known.
They are conducting management-training seminars, hawking their books, making television appearances and soaking up the adoration.

Along with the management gurus and motivational speakers, America's leading universities are now offering high-priced executive M.B.A. programs here.
Major consulting firms are rushing into China to help state-owned companies realign their operations.
The management problems are particularly acute here in northeast China, the nation's Rust Belt, where large industrial companies are struggling with bloated, inefficient operations.
Hoping to reinvent some of these companies, government officials are asking Western experts to unleash a new form of government-backed propaganda, one with decidedly non-Communist slogans, like "downsizing" and "performance-based pay."

The management craze is also being fed by the growth of private enterprises here.

ANALYSTS and investors will have another chance to ponder the intentions of the Federal Reserve this week.
And this reading of tea leaves has the potential to rattle markets more than last week's testimony before Congress by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
The new opportunity comes on Wednesday, when the central bank will release the minutes of the last meeting of Fed policy makers, which took place on Feb. 1 and 2.
Last month, the central bank began releasing this information three weeks after each meeting, changing from its previous practice of waiting until after the next policy meeting, usually six to eight weeks later.
The earlier release makes the market much more sensitive to the comments.

The minutes were conspicuously silent about whether the Fed should continue to announce its intention to raise rates at a "measured" pace, a code phrase generally assumed to mean quarter-point increases at every policy meeting until at least this summer.

But analysts said Fed officials had differing views about what is ahead.
At least some officials are worried about inflationary pressures caused by the dollar's falling value, slowing productivity growth and rising wage costs.
Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, told executives in Alabama on Wednesday that the central bank "still has a ways to go in recalibrating monetary policy" -- a pointed warning that the Fed was not finished with its rate increases.

"Participants thought that the rate of core inflation likely would remain low and stable, assuming further removal of policy accommodation," the Fed said in its summary of the meeting, referring to its strategy of gradually raising interest rates from the lows reached in 2003 and 2004.

In previous months, the minutes have noted that some policy makers wanted to abandon the implied commitment of raising rates at a "measured pace," arguing that the central bank needed more flexibility.

The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, conspicuously avoided using the phrase in two days of testimony in Congress last week, saying only that interest rates are still "fairly low."
"The committee might be on the verge of moving to language that is more flexible," said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm.

But it remains unclear whether a more flexible approach would mean a slowdown or an acceleration of rate increases.
Though some officials are clearly worried about inflation, others are aware that each additional rate increase brings interest rates closer to a "neutral" level that neither juices up the economy nor slows it down.

The consumer price data released on Wednesday suggested that inflation remains low.
The "core" rate of inflation, excluding the volatile prices for food and energy, climbed 0.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis.

High on that list of dreadful objects are cell phone towers, all 170,000 of them.
Scan almost any horizon these days and you see a tall tower making its mark on the skyline.
Many are needed for the 175 million cellphone subscribers in this country.
Some are being built on speculation -- because cellphone companies pay handsomely to cover new territory.
Whatever the reason for this spreading plague of towers, it's clear that the people building them aren't too worried about how they look.
Many are steel needles 90 to 200 feet high.
They have gizmos attached at odd angles in a manner reminiscent of a sole electrical receptacle serving a whole roomful of appliances.
The word sky-clutter comes to mind here.
Some builders have apparently tried to make their towers fit into the landscape.
So far, those results can be even more appalling.

But as Professor Richard Smardon, chairman of the environmental studies faculty at SUNY-Syracuse, explains, the courts and the Federal Communications Commission have made it steadily tougher to stop a cellphone tower, especially one that is pitched as a requirement for the public's safety.
Until the cell tower goes the way of the telephone pole, somebody needs to step in and make these designs beautiful, or at least bearable.
The first step, he said, is to have an energy audit performed by a contractor certified by the Building Performance Institute, a standards-setting organization in Malta, N.Y. "B.P.I.-certified contractors use a whole-house approach to evaluate the safety of appliances and heating and ventilation systems, as well as energy efficiency," he said.

To do that, the contractor uses what is known as a blower door to identify areas that allow infiltration of outside air.
The blower door, he said, is a powerful fan encased in a housing fitted in an exterior door opening.
When the fan is on and pulling air out of the house, outside air will be sucked in through cracks or crevices.
The contractor then uses a smoke pen, which emits puffs of a smokelike substance, to find leaks.
Using a blower door can also determine whether appliances like furnaces, boilers and hot water heaters are properly venting gases.

John Jennings, technical director of Conservation Services Group, an energy firm in Albany, said that while tightening up a home to increase energy efficiency is a good idea, it is critical to ensure that dangerous gases are properly vented.
Using a kitchen fan to exhaust cooking gases could depressurize the house and create a backdraft in the chimney serving the furnace or water heater.
If that happens, deadly carbon monoxide can be pulled back into the house.
Mr. Jennings said that a whole-house audit by a qualified professional is generally the best way to diagnose and solve the problem.

The audit, which can cost up to $200, provides a detailed list of recommendations for increasing safety and efficiency.
Homeowners who decide to act on the recommendations - which can range from caulking windows to replacing an inefficient furnace or adding insulation - are eligible for financial assistance from the agency.
"The first thing we'll do is refund the money you paid for the audit," Mr. Smith said.

Also, he said, if a homeowner borrows to finance the improvements, whose cost can range from several hundred to several thousand dollars, the agency will help with the interest.

If the interest rate on the loan is 8 percent, for example, the agency will cover 4 percentage points.
For homeowners whose income is below certain limits, the agency will provide a grant of 50 percent of the cost of the improvements, up to a maximum of $5,000 per single-family household.
The income limit for a family of four is $53,200.

The wine and liquor business is already primed for some big, transformational deals that would consolidate the largest players, according to executives in the industry, shareholders and bankers.
Diageo, the British company that dominates the industry, is increasing its market share by using its size to push new sales strategies.
Meanwhile, some of the largest companies have healthy balance sheets that they could use to do deals.

But strict regulators and concentrated family ownerships make these tie-ups difficult to accomplish.
In the case of Pernod and Allied, an out-and-out purchase by the French company was never likely: Pernod's market value, at just more than $10 billion, is slightly smaller than Allied's.
Making a joint bid with another spirits company, like Brown-Forman or Fortune Brands, could theoretically give Pernod the mass to get a deal done.
But finding such a partner is tricky.
There isn't necessarily one right partner for Pernod that could help finance a deal and guarantee regulatory approval, analysts said.
That is because regulators will not allow merging liquor companies to retain two brands of the same spirit, so a combination of Pernod with any rival of a similar size would require the sale of several valuable brands.
Another complication is that some of the biggest players in the industry, including Bacardi and Brown-Forman, are still controlled by families, which can make quick and decisive management difficult.

And some players with hefty balance sheets have sworn they do not want to do big deals, analysts said.
For example, Fortune Brands, the owner of Jim Beam, "doesn't have any interest in doing a mega-deal," said Kevin G. Grant, a portfolio manager and investment analyst with the Oakmark Fund, which manages $7.2 billion in assets, including Fortune Brands shares.
The company's philosophy seems to be "they have the brands they need, and a strong business," he said.
The company is an attractive target.
Once considered the weak player in the industry, Allied has turned around its business through a series of smart small deals, including buying wines like Mumm Cuvée Napa and acquiring the distribution rights for Stolichnaya vodka.
Pretax profits grew 6 percent in the 2004 fiscal year and are on track to grow about 11 percent this year.

"The former concerns we had on the company are misplaced," Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note about Allied in late 2004.
"The company has rebalanced its geographical and category exposure with a number of clever acquisitions" and is better placed to weather weaknesses in specific individual markets, the note said.

Questions still remain, though, about Allied's Quick Service Restaurants business, made up of Dunkin Donuts, Baskin-Robbins ice cream and Togo's, a sandwich shop chain.
Together, the three have more than 12,000 franchise sales outlets, and profits increased 21 percent in 2004.
Some analysts argue that getting out of the food industry altogether would let Allied focus entirely on beverages, the faster growing business of the two.
It is something Allied has considered but ultimately decided against, one executive there said.
The equity markets in the United States are not strong enough for an initial public offering there now, this person said, and the European investors do not understand the franchise business enough to take it public here, so Allied has no plans for a sale.
Despite the recent gridlock, the argument for consolidation among the big liquor companies is compelling, many industry executives say, and they predict the deals will happen eventually.

"There's an inevitability to it," the Allied Domecq executive said.
"It's just a question of when."
The theory is fed by Diageo's dominance in the industry.
With a $44 billion market value, Diageo is about four times the size of Allied Domecq.
Even a combination of the second-, third- and fourth-place players would create a company only about half the size of Diageo.

Because Diageo has 17 of the world's top 100 liquor brands, including Smirnoff, José Cuervo and Johnnie Walker, and about one-fifth of the United States market, it has been able to press distributors there to create Diageo-only sales forces, which now have more than 2,000 people coast to coast.
"We're actually seeing Diageo successfully beginning to leverage up scale with their dedicated sales team in the States," said David Hallam, an analyst with Williams de Broe in London.
The teams "live and die" on Diageo sales, Mr. Hallam said, so they are focused on selling their products.

On their own, Diageo's competitors do not sell enough volume, or have enough influence in the market, to persuade distributors to dedicate sales teams in every state, Mr. Hallam said.
Diageo would not be a "driver" of any consolidation, he said, but it could possibly pick up some brands if they were sold off from merging companies.
Organic growth remains Diageo's core strategy, he added.
A combination of Allied and Pernod "really doesn't concern us overtly," Mr. Walsh said during a CNBC interview, "because of course our market share would still be substantially larger" than any combined group.
"As the leader in the premium drinks industry we are in a far better position" than our rivals, he added, which explains their urge to consolidate.
There is a 97 percent occupancy rate for the 1,150 apartments at Port Imperial, which stretches from Weehawken into the towns of West New York and Guttenberg.
(When completed, 6,000 units are expected.)
Not all of the existing buildings in Port Imperial are rentals, however.
The Brownstones, a cluster of 42 town homes near the ferry slip, have been priced as high as $3 million.

As for the rentals, Mr. Tycher explained, the company has not raised rents on many of its apartments in the last 24 months or has done so only at a "nominal" rate, far lower than he would like.
In most of the company's new buildings, he has been offering two to three months rent free, to fill up the buildings.
The company decided that it should shift to creating projects for sale and that the current climate is so favorable, it should raise capital quickly.
Accordingly, it has quietly made a number of property sales within the last three months.
In the biggest deal, struck in February, Roseland is to receive $500 million from the Lennar Corporation of Miami, a publicly traded seller of condominiums in 18 states and the District of Columbia.
Through the deal, Lennar will acquire interests in 15 parcels of Roseland property, some outright and some jointly, and be responsible for securing the financing on future projects that will be developed together.
Roseland will develop, construct and manage the new properties; most are to be condominiums, although there will be some rentals as well as some retail spaces.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The properties sold to Lennar encompass some 1,300 units in Port Imperial and another 1,200 units in Massachusetts, including projects in Malden, Revere and Hingham and a 585-unit condominium and rental development in East Boston called Portside at Pier One.
In addition, Lennar will take over from Roseland 300 existing rental units at Port Imperial and convert them (Mr. Tycher declined to name the building).

In a separate transaction last month, Roseland sold five other parcels at Port Imperial to K. Hovnanian Homes of Red Bank, N.J. Construction is expected to start next year, with the properties yielding 960 condominium units.
Farther south, on the waterfront in Jersey City, Roseland sold the 283-unit Portofino to Crescent Heights, which is based in Florida, for $100 million in December.
It, too, will be converted to condominiums.

Up to this point, Lefrak has focused heavily on rental apartments at the Newport development; only 443 of its nearly 4,000 units there are condominiums.
K. Hovnanian is also constructing more than 200 condominiums in Edgewater in a project called Riverview at City Place.
Economic factors have driven the changes on the waterfront, real estate specialists say.

Roseland's deal with Lennar is a 50-50 partnership on future development although the proceeds of the sales will not exactly be split down the middle.
(Roseland estimates that future sales will exceed $2 billion, with $1.3 billion coming from Port Imperial.)
Average sales of the new condos are expected to be around $600,000.

For Roseland, the cash provided by the sales and the joint venture arrangement will allow a faster construction schedule on the next phase of the development in Weehawken, according to Mr. Tycher.
"Developing Port Imperial by ourselves would not get the velocity quick enough," he said.
One of the first projects undertaken by the joint venture will start next fall on the site of what is known here as the Banana Building, a former fruit warehouse.
The building also houses the corporate offices for New York Waterway, the beleaguered ferry service whose owners are a partner of Roseland in the development of some of the buildings at Port Imperial.
A major ferry slip is at Port Imperial.

So far, both parties in the venture seem happy with the pairing.
After shepherding Port Imperial for nearly two decades, through legal battles and fierce local opposition from some citizens' groups to the development, Mr. Tycher acknowledged that he was having a difficult time letting go on some of the property.

"Addressing the government's own imbalances will require scrutiny of both spending and taxes," Mr. Greenspan told members of the House Budget Committee.

The Fed chairman emphasized that his own preference was to reduce deficits by cutting spending rather than raising taxes.
"It's the principle that I think is involved here, namely that you cannot continuously introduce legislation which tends to expand the budget deficit," Mr. Greenspan said.

"When you begin to do the arithmetic of what the rising debt level implied by the deficits tells you, and you add interest costs to that ever-rising debt, at ever-higher interest rates, the system becomes fiscally destabilizing," he told lawmakers.

"The president does have a substantial deficit-reduction package," said Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman.
"His budget is a continuation of that policy, and he looks forward to working with Congress in cutting that spending down.
Likewise, the president agrees that the long-term budget is the issue, which is why he's trying to lead a national discussion and reform movement to save and strengthen Social Security."
Mr. Greenspan's comments deepened a long-running disagreement between the Federal Reserve and the White House, and they come at a moment when House and Senate leaders are trying to hammer out a budget resolution or blueprint for tax and spending bills this year.
Mr. Greenspan, a Republican, has long argued that Congress should reinstate rules that would require lawmakers to offset the cost of tax cuts and new spending programs with savings in other areas.

Mr. Bush and his Republican allies in Congress have insisted that any such "pay as you go" restrictions, which existed in the 1990's, apply only to new spending and not to new tax cuts.

Reinstating the previous budget rules would make it far more difficult, if not almost impossible, for Congress to extend permanently Mr. Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.

Extending all of the expiring tax cuts add about $1.8 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
That would come on top of a rapid escalation in the federal debt from $3.4 trillion to $4.3 trillion as a result of soaring annual deficits since 2001.
House and Senate lawmakers are hoping to unveil a budget resolution as early as next week, and many Republicans want to include provisions that would allow the Senate to approve tax cuts this year with a simple majority of 51 votes.
Without a budget resolution, Senate rules effectively require that such tax cuts be approved by a two-thirds majority.

None of Mr. Bush's big tax cuts are scheduled to expire this year, but the 2003 tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains are to expire in 2008, and the other big tax cuts are all to expire by the end of 2011.
Making all of those tax cuts permanent, as Mr. Bush wants, would add about $1.8 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says.

In addition to calling for a return to the tough budget rules of the 1990's, the last of which expired in 2002, Mr. Greenspan urged Congress to adopt a mechanism that would allow for a "midcourse correction" in the event that budget deficits turn out to be sharply higher than expected.
That is another idea that the White House and Republican legislators have previously rejected, and it is one that is unlikely to be embraced this year.

Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the House Budget Committee, immediately took issue with Mr. Greenspan on the need for restrictions on future tax cuts.
But Mr. Greenspan stood firm, contending that the "overriding" principle was to reduce the deficit and that Congress should find ways to pay for the cost of making the tax cuts permanent.

"Differing people hold differing views, and compromise is essential in getting a functioning legislature to work its will," Mr. Greenspan said.

In his testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan repeated his strong support for a crucial element of Mr. Bush's plan to replace part of Social Security with a system of private savings accounts.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan implied the need for much bigger cuts than Mr. Bush has suggested in the government's full array of old-age entitlement programs, including Medicare as well as Social Security.
"I fear that we may have already committed more fiscal resources to the baby boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver," he told lawmakers.
"If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later."

Nor has the bank given up its intention to raise interest rates from their current level, a record low in the post-World War II period.
Mr. Trichet worries that over time, the loose monetary policy will fuel inflation, though he acknowledged there is no evidence of that so far.
"Everybody knows that at a time, we will have to raise rates," he said.
"That is anticipated by all observers."
That time, however, now seems likely to slip into the second half of this year, according to economists who watch the bank.
They say the bank will need to sift through another set of economic reports to determine whether the setback is a temporary dip or something more serious.

Although interest rates have risen recently, that move is not considered negative for two reasons.
One is that interest rates would be expected to rise when the economy is growing nicely and Federal Reserve policy makers are pushing their short-term interest rate benchmark higher.
And longer-term rates, like the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, are still unexpectedly low, given the strength of the economy and the fact that the Fed's benchmark rate has been raised 1.5 percentage points since June, to 2.5 percent.
"It is very normal in a bull market for stocks to be rising and for interest rates to be rising," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors.
"Interest rates have not reached a level that threatens the economy or earnings."

The county's traffic remediation efforts at trouble spots like this, when considered as a whole, are almost random.
Mr. DeMuro happens to live in a city that acknowledges only spotty efforts to track accidents and reduce their frequency.

To start with, there is no single group overseeing or studying automobile accidents on county roadways; instead there is a loose conglomeration of at least 46 separate entities responsible for 4,868 miles of highways, parkways, routes, streets and avenues.
They include the New York State Department of Transportation, the New York State Thruway Authority, Westchester County, and all 43 cities, towns and villages.
"There are a lot of overlapping jurisdictions," said Christopher McBride, a community traffic specialist for the Automobile Club of New York, adding that "there should be better coordination among these public agencies."
"Every agency knows their roads," said Mr. Roseman, whose department oversees safety on 167 miles of roads, including the 20's era Bronx River Parkway.
But it "knows little of the operating characteristics of the others."

But the chief of the special operations unit of the police department, George Masseo, says he makes a special effort to study accident statistics so that he can make the roadways safer.

He says the city hopes to adopt an automatic speeding ticket system for runners of red lights, similar to the one now in use in New York City.
It works with radar guns mounted at dangerous intersections, photographing the license plates of all cars exceeding the speed limit, even if only by 5 miles an hour.
The registered owners are then mailed their traffic tickets.
Adoption of the plan is contingent on pending state legislation allowing such devices in all cities larger than 50,000 people.
The Yonkers traffic department, which does not readily share accident figures, declined to provide them for this article.
But the city, like Mount Vernon, does not methodically track accident frequencies, only compiling them on what Martin Dougherty, a city traffic engineer, called an "as needed basis."

WHATEVER critics may say about accidents on local roads, Westchester's image improves when major divided highways are taken into account.
Despite sometimes dramatic evidence to the contrary, highways have lower accident rates than smaller roadways, and because Westchester surpasses nearby counties in miles of highway, its overall accident prevention record compares favorably with its neighbors'.

One measure of that is traffic deaths.
There were 53 in Westchester in 2003, the most recent year for which Motor Vehicles Department data are available.
Another rough measure is crashes per 10,000 licensed drivers.
The New York State Department of Transportation is responsible for 1,500 miles of roadways in the county; along with the Thruway Authority, it operates or maintains all major highways and parkways here.
At this lofty level, recalibrating traffic signals is clearly not the issue.
Instead, says Michael Duval, who runs the brand-new Hudson Valley Transportation Management Center in Hawthorne, "we're monitoring congestion and incident-management functions."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
By "incident," he means potentially catastrophic highway accidents, and the center's first experience with that came last summer, when a gasoline tanker overturned on Route 9A in Ossining, setting fire to the surrounding area and spilling fuel into the Hudson River.

In such cases, "agencies need to communicate with each other to determine who's in charge of the cleanup," Mr. Duval explained.

Mr. Duval and other department representatives are openly proud of their new $24 million facility, which shares its site with a State Police headquarters.
The center employees' job is to observe and track traffic flow in seven counties -- Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Columbia, Ulster, Orange and Westchester.
Most of that traffic is actually in Westchester.
Mr. Duval says the center was designed to accommodate an ever-evolving, "intelligent" transportation system, which uses sensors and acoustic detectors to gauge speed and traffic volume; workers can also see accidents on cameras situated at high-volume sites.

DISCUSSING highway safety recently, Thomas M. Louizou, administrator of the Eastern region for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in White Plains, issued the old driver-ed reminder that accidents are usually not inevitable.
Rather, he recapped, they result from a combination of factors, including driver error, impaired driving, vehicle-related failure, and faulty road design and construction.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But that last problem, he pointed out, is usually less of a factor on major highways, which tend to be safer than local roads.
Interstates "have limited access and uniform speeds," said Mr. Louizou, adding that accidents on county and state roads are often caused by drivers speeding without the protection of a center divider.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Great as interstates are, however, repairing them increases accidents -- and most Westchester drivers are ruefully aware that I-287, aka the Cross-Westchester Expressway, has been in successive stages of repair since 2000.
"Construction reduces the width of the lanes, and there are no shoulders, and lanes keep shifting," said Ramesh Mehta, division director of the Thruway Authority for the Hudson Valley region.
The work near the highway's Exit 4 is to be completed in June, he said, and there will be one more project farther east, to be completed by 2007.
"On the Cross-Westchester," he said, "the exits are very close and there is very little weaving length."
Eventually the construction will make the exits safer, as well as widen the right shoulder to 10 feet.

Dismissing the frustrated driver's notion that "eventually" in this case seems more like forever, Mr. Mehta termed I-287, I-95 and I-684 "the safest roads in Westchester."

What the Roads Rate
THERE are significantly more accidents on local roads like Routes 1, 100B and 119, than on major highways like I-287 or I-95, after factoring in the number of cars that travel on those roads each day.
The New York State Department of Transportation compiles accident statistics, known by the catchy name of Safety Information Management System Accident Severity Summary, for nearly every major roadway in the county.
It details the number of deaths and of accidents with injuries, as well as the accident rate, an industry standard that computes accidents per million vehicle-miles traveled, a figure based on average daily traffic.
(The figures below are for the entire length of each roadway in Westchester County, and do not reflect accident rates at any single spot.)

Comparing accident rates for one year, from June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2002, it is clear that Route 1, also known as the Boston Post Road, which runs from Pelham to Port Chester, had the highest rate, 9.65 accidents per million vehicle-miles, followed by Route 100B, which runs from Dobbs Ferry to Greenburgh, with a rate of 8.68.
Route 119, which runs between Tarrytown and White Plains, parallel to I-287, had a rate of 8.05.
Using just the accident rate for the 2001-2 time period, the safest road in Westchester was I-684, at .83.
The most dangerous road was the tiny Westchester portion of Route 9D, the intersection with the Bear Mountain Bridge, which is just south of the Putnam County line.

The big question heading into this year's N.C.A.A.
tournament will be how Illinois responds to its first loss.
"You're going to lose some time," an upbeat Weber said after the game.
"We'd rather lose now than three weeks from now."
"I don't know if it was the undefeated season or because guys weren't making the shots that they normally make."

"The next stretch is the most important stretch of the year," Weber said.
"That's what people are going to remember."
In some ways, the pattern resembles the handoff from consumer-led growth to business-led growth that many Federal Reserve officials hoped would occur.

The most encouraging trend is business investment: spending on equipment and software rose 13.5 percent last year and at an annual pace of 18 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Analysts say much of the investment last year was to replace and repair equipment.
This year, much of the spending is likely to be for expanding production capacity.
Dell is spending nearly $1 billion to add a factory in North Carolina.
Makers of telecommunications equipment, which have been battered since the dot-com bubble burst, are again adding capacity to meet demand for networking equipment, cellphones and cellular infrastructure equipment.

But for all the good news, many economic forecasters remain worried about the broader global imbalances.
The United States' large trade deficit, which exceeded $600 billion last year, is expected to widen in 2005 and increase the country's enormous foreign indebtedness.

Exports are unlikely to redress that balance this year, most analysts predict, because Europe and Japan are growing at anemic rates in comparison with the United States.

That means American demand for imports is likely to expand much more rapidly than European and Japanese demand for American exports.
And with American imports almost twice as great as exports, America's exports must grow far more rapidly to even begin a reduction in the trade deficit.
"The world is still too dependent on U.S. spending," said Nigel Gault, an economist at Global Insight, a forecasting firm, in Lexington, Mass.
"We're still increasing imbalances in the global economy, so the U.S. is still increasingly dependent on the inflow of foreign capital."

At the company, a unit of Siemens of Germany, electrical equipment sales to industrial customers plunged by a third after 2001.
But Harry Volande, chief financial officer at Siemens Energy and Automation, said industrial sales of electrical equipment and automation systems would expand by double digits, even as sales to the residential housing market flatten with the cooling of the housing market and a tapering off of construction activity.

A bigger uncertainty is the ability of consumers to keep spending.
Consumer spending climbed faster than personal income last year, but the personal savings rate is down to 1 percent.
"If consumer demand falters, then business caution will intensify," predicted Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.
Mr. Roach, who is far gloomier than most analysts, contends that competitive pressures from China and other low-wage countries are limiting wage gains among white-collar as well as blue-collar workers in the United States.

This adjustment process does not even require that sellers own shares of the overpriced stock.
Someone who thinks that the price of a stock will fall but does not own any shares can borrow shares to sell, a practice known as selling short.

If an investor sells short and the stock price does indeed fall, he can buy shares to pay back the loan and pocket the difference as profit.
As with other sorts of borrowing, the borrower typically has to pay interest on the loan.
The question is, Why not?
Owen A. Lamont, a professor of finance at the Yale School of Management, reviews some recent work in the economics of short selling in the latest issue of the NBER Reporter (available at www.nber.org).

One would expect that 3Com shares would be worth at least 1.5 times the value of Palm shares.
The market was valuing the non-Palm part of 3Com's business at minus $63.

This pricing anomaly was widely reported in the financial press.
These traders were presumably unaware that they could acquire Palm indirectly by buying 3Com stock.
A savvy investor could buy some 3Com shares outright, borrow some Palm shares, sell them, and repay the borrowed Palm stock in a few months when 3Com issued the Palm shares.

(The number could exceed 100 percent since shares could be borrowed only to be lent out again.)
According to Professor Lamont and his co-author on one paper, Richard H. Thaler, a big part of the problem is that the market for borrowing shares is not a centralized market with quoted prices, but rather a highly disaggregated market.

In many cases, it was quite difficult to find shares of Palm that could be sold -- and when they could be found, the interest rate charged to borrow them was quite high.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Short selling was not the only way to bet against Palm.
One could also buy put options, which allowed the stock to be sold for a fixed price.
But the options were also mispriced during this period, making such investments unattractive.

Many intelligent investors believe that short selling is a strong signal of subsequent price declines.
Professor Lamont's work and that of several other academics find that this is so: stocks that are subject to large short selling tend to have lower subsequent returns.
One might ask why short selling is not immediately reflected in the price of a stock.
The reason appears to be related to the basic problem with short selling: there is no centralized market for borrowing stock, so it can take time to find shares to sell short.
Typically, there is no problem in finding shares of large companies that are traded frequently.
But shares of small companies, whose stock is lightly traded, may be hard to find.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
This finding suggests that the total amount of short selling might be a good predictor of stock market movements in general.
Somewhat surprisingly, this turns out not to be true.
As Professor Lamont and his co-author on another paper, Jeremy C. Stein, remark, "Short selling does not play a particularly helpful role in stabilizing the overall stock market."
But again one must ask why not.
One suggested answer is that short selling arbitrage has more risk than appears at first glance.
For example, the owner of the shares can force the borrower to return them under certain conditions.
Hence, the short seller might find his position unwound at an inconvenient time.
This risk factor means that short sellers may want to take smaller positions than they would otherwise prefer.
It appears that at least on some occasions, short selling constraints can disrupt the normal operation of supply and demand: when supply is constrained, stock prices end up being determined by those who are overly optimistic.

Now for Palestinians, he said, "the challenge is on the level of to be or not to be."
He was wrong to believe after the Sept. 11 attacks that the Bush administration would tilt to him and away from Israel, to court the Muslim world.
Israel began forbidding even the Palestinian Police to function, saying they included terrorists.
"No doubt."
He believed that a distinct Palestinian nationalism would take shape through armed struggle with Israel.
The Palestinians are divided by class, religion and geography, yet, drawn together by opposition to Israel, they have attained a national coherence that other recovering wards of British colonialism -- like the Iraqis -- lack.
Those living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza after the Six-Day War came to resent authority.
Liberated in a way by their very statelessness -- lacking a glass house -- Palestinians developed what the political scientist Khalil Shikaki has called a "culture of criticism," freely ridiculing Arab autocrats and declaring they could do better.
Hardest for some Palestinians to admit is the influence of Israel, of the parliamentary debates and acerbic press they followed on television and in the newspapers.
To be Palestinian is to be intimately, painfully acquainted with paradox.
It is to know that, in part, you owe your national character and your democratic dream to the very people who occupied your land and compromised your rights.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
This national coherence and democratic aspiration combine to explain why, on Arafat's death, the Palestinian public pivoted from Arafat to Mahmoud Abbas and why it did it so smoothly.
2, Abbas, who turns 70 this month, as one of the few national figures remaining -- one with the credentials to span the divided populations of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and the diaspora.
Hassan Khreisheh, an opposition member of the Palestinian Parliament, tied these themes together when he proudly declared at the swearing-in of Abbas, "Our people have put an end to the 99.999 percent that Arab leaders have become accustomed to."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But these strands in the Palestinian identity do not usually pull in the same direction.
With national liberation as his goal, Arafat was able to slough off such niceties of nation-building as creating an independent court system, just as low-level militants are still able to avoid licensing their cars.
Who could dun men who are risking their lives for the cause?
For many Palestinians, building a state before they have one puts the cart before the horse.
The occupation will confuse matters, and the focus will be on resistance."
Even the most reform-minded Palestinians bridle at the fact that President George W. Bush has made democratic change a condition for negotiations.
"I always preach the need to look in the mirror -- responsibility, accountability, all of that," Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian minister of finance and the official closest to the Bush administration, said with some heat.
"But you should not mistake the depth of my feeling about how unfair it is to put conditions on our freedom."
We were speaking in his Ramallah office, which looks out on an Israeli settlement.
For Abbas, nation-building is the path to national liberation.
It is the armed struggle that must give way.
"I told them everything openly -- that I'm against the armed intifada, I'm against the rockets," Abbas told me one night in February in Gaza City.
So I told them the truth, and for that I believe -- I don't know -- they elected me."
Much has been made of the fact that Abbas wears a suit rather than a uniform and headdress, as Arafat did.
His style is not that of a charismatic leader but of a negotiator, and both Palestinians and Israelis suspect him of being soft.
He has a negotiator's surface mildness, not a politician's riveting passion -- possibly a severe handicap for the leader of a liberation movement.
He prefers not to dwell on old grievances ("It's better not to talk about history or religion," he told me once with a wry smile at the improbability of this sentiment's being realized), and in the interview he tried to avoid assigning blame for this intifada.
He refused to call the uprising a mistake, saying that what's done is done.
Yet his mildness should not be mistaken for uncertainty, as Arafat's bluster was sometimes mistaken for decision.
While Abbas is conciliatory in trying to achieve his principles, he is certain about the principles themselves.
He comes across as entirely confident and in command, even a little supercilious.
When he wants to smoke -- and he often does -- his practice is to tilt a cigarette tip into the air and wait for an aide to snap to with a lighter.

Since he was in his 20's, Abbas worked in Arafat's shadow, quarreling with him, sometimes breaking with him, but ultimately serving beside him.
He is my brother, but the brothers also have their own differences."
Abbas, and the world, can now test if those differences matter.
Arafat could never completely break with armed conflict; his fortress became not only his prison but also the Palestinians'.
Abbas wants Palestine to make sense abroad.
By ending what he calls the armed intifada and creating an orderly Palestinian state-in-waiting, he seeks to rally the world to the Palestinian cause and, above all, to recruit an American president who equates democracy with freedom and freedom with peace.
To do this, Abbas will have to persuade Palestinians to be patient and to embrace, for now, yet another paradox in their national life -- democracy without freedom.
It is the only way that he sees to eventually exchange the dream of Palestine, and the nightmare of Palestine, for a state of Palestine.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- a narcissistic face-off that pays little notice to the world around it -- counsels cynicism as the safest guide.
Yet the seemingly endless, and in fact episodic, violence disguises the fact that over the last 20 years, the two peoples have moved toward recognizing each other's rights to statehood.
Still, Abbas's strategy is one for the long term.
Arafat's departure may have removed an impediment to calm and to state-building.
But it seems less likely to have removed an obstacle to their higher forms, peace and sovereignty.
It may simply lay bare how far apart even leaders who wear suits remain.
Abbas's approach is different, but his stated goals are like Arafat's.
Like other Palestinians who support a two-state solution, Abbas argues that the Palestinian leadership made its territorial concession many years ago, agreeing to settle for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.
That amounts to a mere 22 percent of historic Palestine, Abbas likes to point out.
A refugee himself, Abbas is no less insistent than Arafat that Israel recognize a "right of return" for refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and their descendants, though he has explored ways to limit any resulting immigration into Israel.
But the intifada has made the Israelis far less likely to offer as much as Barak did.
While Abbas struggles to build a state, Sharon is forging ahead with plans that may well define it.
As he tries to pull Israelis out of Gaza and four settlements on the northern West Bank, Sharon is building Israel's barrier elsewhere on the West Bank and tightening its hold on the big settlements there.
He is chipping away at Abbas's 22 percent.

Abbas knows all this.
I hope we will see it."
Most Palestinians I spoke to think that he will not.
An optimist in Palestine these days is someone who believes that calm will prevail for a few years, before the next intifada begins.
To the outside world, Abbas may look like the one-eyed man in the land of the blind.
He is trying to persuade Palestinians of things that seem obvious: that firing crude rockets into Israeli fields harms Palestinians more than Israelis, by summoning overwhelming Israeli retaliation; that dispatching the young to blow themselves up among Israelis is also a form of national suicide.
Yet seen from inside Palestine, the violence has developed a logic of its own.
Militants in Gaza and on the West Bank believe that it is they who see the world as it is.
In theory, Abu Shbak bears great responsibility for making this latest attempt at calm succeed.
He is the chief of the Palestinian Preventive Security force in the Gaza Strip, the notional front-line force in any strategy to stop militants.
Gaza is emerging as the proving ground for a Palestinian state because of Sharon's plan to remove the 8,500 Israeli settlers who live there and the many thousands more troops who guard them.

"After four and a half years of intifada, four and a half years of chaos -- of absence of law and order -- the mission is very tough for Abu Mazen," Abu Shbak said, referring to Abbas by his nickname.
(It means "Father of Mazen"; Mazen, Abbas's eldest son, died three years ago.)
He added, "I hope in the coming days there will be changes."
Abu Shbak was talking like a man inheriting a big mess.
I had a memory of him pounding his desk almost two years ago and declaring of rockets that militants launched into Israel, "We are convinced that the firing of Qassams must be stopped!"
At the time, maybe I should have paid more attention to the passive voice.
But I had spent enough time in Palestine to know why a security chief could call for action and supply none.
Inevitably, a devastating Israeli raid to stop the rockets would provide a reason, or pretext, not to act.

Skip forward again to January.
Our conversation was getting weirder.
"The security apparatus should abide by the law," Abu Shbak declared indignantly.
I could only agree; for more than two years, the security services had been like private militias.
But Abu Shbak was not referring to the rule of law in general.
Palestinian officials were then negotiating, unsuccessfully, not for their own state but for the Israelis to pull their troops back to their positions before the uprising.
I said this reminded me of the Jewish story in which a rabbi advises a man to bring a goat into his home; when, at the rabbi's instructions, he eventually takes the goat out, the man's wife no longer finds her house too small.
"Israeli diplomacy," he said, "is based on this idea."

I did not know the man accompanying Mashharawi.
The hard boys of the militant groups tend to swagger and pose, as if a photographer at any moment might snap their portraits for martyr posters.

"Ah," Abu Shbak exclaimed, brightening at the sight of the second man.
"By chance you meet the leader of the Abu Al Reesh Brigades!"
The Abu Al Reesh Brigades is a militant offshoot of Fatah, Arafat's mainstream, secular-leaning faction, which dominates the Palestinian Authority and to which Abbas, Abu Shbak and Mashharawi belong.
Abu Al Reesh is part of the loose confederation of Fatah freedom fighters, terrorists and gangsters that also includes the Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades.
Militants say that the Israelis call him the Fox, though militants tend to say things like that, and it is not always clear how they would know.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
It struck me as unusual, even by Gazan standards, that the Fox would pay a call on the head of Preventive Security.
"He was my teacher in Israeli jail," Abu Amani explained, nodding at the benignly beaming Abu Shbak.
"It's my duty to visit him."
The road map, the negotiating template drawn up by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia, calls on the Palestinian Authority to immediately begin "sustained, targeted and effective operations aimed at confronting all those engaged in terror and dismantlement of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure."
But Abbas is trying to co-opt militants, not confront them.
The relationship between Abu Shbak and Abu Amani helps to explain why the new Palestinian leader is using this approach.
They are not just old friends.
They are comrades in the same struggle -- a struggle not only for statehood but also for political control of Palestine right now.
From the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian factions began competing to conduct sensational attacks as much to score political points against one another as to kill and terrify Israelis.
Within Fatah -- a word that translates as "conquest" -- militants like Abu Amani are seen as having preserved the faction from a challenge by the Islamic Resistance Movement, known by its acronym, Hamas, which is also an Arabic word that means "zeal."
The day after meeting Abu Amani, I sat in a Gaza City coffee shop with three Fatah militants.
"This revived Fatah.
Abu Mazen must understand it."

When I asked if he would accept a job with the security services, which is how Abbas hopes to co-opt the militants, he looked blank.
"We're Fatah," he said.
"It's their duty to get us jobs."
He had seen many friends die, he said, and he was not going to settle for getting his mattress back.
He had a list of demands, including an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines, and little expectation the Israelis would meet it.
"Nobody should blame Abu Mazen later if they find out he is taking the same path as Arafat," he said.
Abbas has shown no sign of promoting any alternative resistance, like civil disobedience.
When negotiations stall, these men see only one road.
"Resistance is not a hobby," he added.
That is a mantra I have often heard from such men.
It means, I think, that this is not a game, that violence is not entered into lightly or abandoned easily.

The fighters were willing to quiet things down, but they would keep their weapons handy.
"And the day we feel they aren't doing what they promised," Abu Haroun said, "we will use them again."
Unlike the men of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, these Fatah militants say they want a two-state solution.
That is why, for Fatah, there is a strategic component to this violent interfactional politicking.
It is perhaps the most twisted rule of Palestine, but it makes sense to those who advocate it.
"It's very helpful for the peace," he said that day of the violence.

I had asked Barghouti, then in hiding, about recent high-profile Fatah killings, including the first suicide bombing by a woman.
He insisted that he supported attacking only settlers and soldiers in occupied territory, resistance that Palestinians believe to be legal under international law.
Because it had killed so many Israelis, it could make peace.
"Do you think a very weak organization can protect a historical agreement?"
Yet in salvaging a Palestinian constituency, Fatah, and Arafat, sacrificed their Israeli one.
With Al Aksa suicide bombers exploding in Tel Aviv, Israelis no longer saw any difference between the factions.
Fatah seemed as intent as Hamas on destroying Israel.
There is a final reason that violence is likely to remain at hand for the Palestinian national movement: Palestinians have good cause to believe that it is working.
Although the outside world sees the intifada as purely a disaster for the Palestinians, within Palestine, the violence seems to have succeeded, at a high cost.
It has resulted in something, at least in prospect, that all the negotiating by men like Abbas never achieved: the actual evacuation of Israeli settlements.

In mid-February, I returned to Gaza to see if the Abbas administration and the prospect of Israeli withdrawal were changing life on the ground.
Most striking, along the trashed roads of the Jabaliya refugee camp, uniformed police officers were stopping cars and demanding to see proof of insurance.
He quit, confirming his reputation as a sulker.
He was now starting to dispel that reputation.
With Arafat gone, Abbas, at heart a closed-door diplomat, was beginning to act like a politician.
Criticizing them is the true third rail of Palestinian politics.
It is the first time in my life."
"I don't know how it happened!"
"We are starting below zero, not from zero," Abbas said.
"From every corner, we have to start from the very beginning.
It is not impossible.
It is difficult, very difficult.
But not impossible."
But in Gaza, as on the West Bank, people were feeling few other changes.
It abuts Israel's Gush Qatif settlement bloc, which is surrounded by a wall more than 40 feet high of concrete and steel, braced by guard towers.
Israel has responded to the mortar and rocket fire into Gush Qatif with repeated raids into Khan Yunis, churning the landscape into a heaving sea of broken concrete and twisted rebar.
Down a dirt track about a hundred yards from the wall stands a three-story cinder-block tenement.
Beside it lie the remains of neighboring houses.
Its own walls are so pocked with bullet holes, scores of them, that the building resembles a cheese grater.
You could fit apples through some of the bullet holes in the walls.

In Gaza City, I met another woman from Khan Yunis, Rana El Farra.
Wearing winter coats, we spoke in the family's apartment, its windows open despite the day's chill.
Open windows are less likely to shatter from sudden shifts in air pressure; the apartment is across the street from a Palestinian security headquarters, a frequent Israeli bombing target.
El Farra asks Gazans to gargle it, then return it to her to provide DNA samples, which she isolates in a gel.
A molecular biologist, El Farra is archiving Gaza's DNA in hopes of curing diseases like the diabetes that contributed to her beloved father's death, as well as of comparing the oral histories of Gaza's clans with their DNA footprints.
"I prepare the samples here, and then DHL them to the States," she said in her idiomatic English.
She sends them to Utah for sequencing at Brigham Young University, where she got her master's.
She loved Utah, feeling at home with its conservative values, its big families.

"Only it's cleaner."

She saw no contradiction between her science and her religion, finding God's handiwork in the intricate, complete systems of cells.
But she did find contradictions in her politics, and trying to follow her thinking was like racing through a series of switchbacks up a steep mountain trail.
She is hopeful that Abbas will improve life for Palestinians, but she did not vote for him because she is fed up with his faction.
But she supported Hamas only for internal reform, not conducting relations with Israel.

"We just need a break," she said.
"I know the war between the Israelis and the Palestinians will be there until God stops the whole system.
But we just need a break of five years."
She explained, "We got used to this system, of taking this break for some time, probably 10 years, and then, when things reach a point where no one can deal with them anymore, then war will be for some time."
"I don't think it's the right time for suicide bombings," she said.
"When they say no to peace, we have to be able to answer back," she said.
She thought the two sides would never settle their differences -- because Israeli Jews would never yield the man-made plateau in Jerusalem that they call the Temple Mount and because Muslims would never relinquish their claim to the same plot, which they call the Noble Sanctuary.
"It's very contradictory, the feelings that we have and our reality," she said at last.
"The reality is pushing very hard."
"Our feelings and beliefs are pushing hard, too.
You know what I mean?
It's very contradictory.
And I see this with all the people, and I see it with myself too.
See, you want to have peace; you want to live; you want to have children; you want to be able to live a normal life.
But at the same time you cannot just give up on everything in return for this."
She paused, then added more quietly, "For me, I think we all need psychotherapy here, at least in Gaza."
From this welter of political impulses, Abbas was trying to wrest a political deal with Hamas.
His strategy was to contain it, just as the Israeli system contains parties that reject any Palestinian state.
Islamic Jihad would follow Hamas, Abbas's advisers said.
A mountain of a man with four wives -- "I love women," he once told me -- he is one of Hamas's most charismatic leaders, pulling young men into the movement.
He has been in hiding from Israel for 18 months.
He was very proud of his second son, killed at 16 in a suicidal shooting attack on a settlement.
"To get back our land," he said another time, "it seems to me we have to lose half of this generation."
But gone were the days when he would bring his laptop to an interview so he could call up scriptural justifications for suicide bombings.
Hamas was having only its more polished spokesmen and sophists speak with the media.
It was treading very carefully.
Abbas told me that he would be happy to appoint ministers from Hamas.
"If they want to participate, why not?"
"It's good for us."
"If they rule, what are their choices?"
asked Ziad Abu Amr, a legislator and political scientist who is Abbas's chief liaison to Hamas.
"Do they go and negotiate with Israel or do they declare all-out war?
Can they afford this?
I don't think so."
Abu Amr thought Hamas could win as many as half the parliamentary seats.
Even if Hamas wins a small minority of seats, it will supply an effective opposition, promoting debate and legitimizing what is otherwise government by Fatah.
It might also, at last, wake Fatah up to its political decay.
Regardless of the ferocity of its militants, Fatah was facing a reckoning for its failure at nation-building.
Palestinians were referring to the halt in violence not as a cease-fire but merely as a "tahdiyah" -- a "lull."
Palestinian officials were concerned that leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Damascus would not back the political deal.
Allies of Abbas were pressing Palestinian security chiefs to cut off this money.

Over time, Abbas was betting that a massive jobs program, together with an Israeli withdrawal, would strengthen his hand.
He could not even be certain his orders were being carried out.
"He still has to institutionalize his authority," Abu Amr said.
Abbas was depending on some Fatah officials with reputations for corruption.
The campaign over, he had also stopped making public speeches.
Qurei resisted appointing new faces to the government until he faced a parliamentary revolt.
No wonder Gazans were mocking Fatah by calling it by a feminine form, "Fat'hiah" -- a name that brought to mind a doddering peasant woman.
One day while I was in Gaza, gunmen from two large families burst into a Gaza City prison and shot dead two accused murderers.
That day, Hamas militants fired off some rockets, prompting two other groups -- not wanting to cede the political stage -- to do the same; each group followed its salvo with a press statement.
I was visiting Mashharawi in his heavily guarded office.
He was still working the phones and meeting with militants, reminding them of their "national duty," keeping the lid on.
On one wall hung a framed poster that was a gift from the Abu Al Reesh Brigades.
It showed a man lying amid rubble and bore the words, "You purify my soul, you martyr."
He was smiling.
"Now, we can move more freely, sleep more."

With the Israelis easing travel restrictions, word in mid-February was that one could drive from the growing fortification of the Israeli barrier around Jerusalem to Jenin without hitting a checkpoint.
After leaving Gaza, I gave it a try.
Besides, on the West Bank, spring was coming.
The almond trees were blooming white, and the first poppies with their startling red were spangling green fields that would soon bake to dust.
Spring is always an ambiguous moment in Palestine: a time of hope, yet also the time of year that makes the land seem most worth the contest.
Hawashin is not a militant leader or a politician, though he functions as a liaison between them.
He is not a religious thinker or a deeply educated man, though in an environment that does not always favor it, he thinks for himself.
He is broad-shouldered, with a close-shaved scalp and something of the appearance of Laurence Fishburne, together with that actor's air of steeliness and potential menace.
He is 34, though he seems years older.
He leads a considered life.
It is a kind of courage found, if not celebrated, in Palestine like everywhere else.
He grew up in Jenin's refugee camp, a forge of extremism, and still lives there.
He dreamed of becoming an electrical engineer, but could not afford the tuition.
He now works as an electrician on the side while doing one of the toughest jobs in Jenin: he is in charge of collecting utility fees.
Jenin residents took to not paying their bills during the uprising and even to attacking the collectors.
"If I go to the U.S., in five years I can get residency," he said once.
"We are 50 years living here in Jenin, and we have never been considered residents."
"My dream as a refugee is not to return back to my original village," he said.
"It's to buy a piece of land here and register it under my own name."
He wanted a house with a garden -- "a normal house, where I can keep my memories to myself."
He had bought the land, but he could not yet afford to build.
Most militants are from the camps, and when Israel forbade the Palestinian Police to operate, the militants began taking control of cities like Jenin, in some cases avenging themselves on elites.
Jenin is now effectively run by an Al Aksa leader, Zacharia Zubeida.
Part of the challenge for Abbas is to make sure that West Bank enclaves like Jenin do not feel forgotten as he focuses on Gaza.
For Abbas to consolidate control, he must somehow sideline the local warlords.
"I want them to have a childhood," he said.
"I don't want them to spend a day in jail."
Hawashin admired Abbas's courage in criticizing the armed intifada.
Now he was hearing a Palestinian leader say similar things.
"There's a shared quality you can find in both Abu Mazen and Sharon, which is clarity and frankness," he said.
"Sharon is clear with his own people and in telling the world what he wants."
The parallel may run deeper.
Abbas is trying a Palestinian version of Sharon's own unilateralism.
In pushing for a pullout from Gaza, Sharon is trying to break the zero-sum logic of the conflict, to persuade his people that a move that appears to benefit the Palestinians is actually in Israel's interest.
For his part, Abbas is trying to end Palestinian violence and promote democracy to serve the Palestinian interest, not Israel's.
These are not concessions to each other.
They are concessions to reality.
But realists can disagree as strongly as myth-makers, and for better reasons.
Many Palestinians believe Arafat encouraged the intifada to give an outlet to discontent with his own rule.
"Unfortunately, our symbol -- and we consider him a model -- his real mistake was not to establish institutions in Fatah or the Palestinian Authority."
"Everyone knows the reality," he said.
What is known rather grimly as a "final status" deal does appear a long way off.
There is a possible intermediate step, and Abbas fears it.
He worries that the Israelis and Americans will seize on a Gaza withdrawal to push for a possibility mentioned in the road map, the creation of "an independent Palestinian state with provisional borders."
No one knows exactly what this would be.
But it would give the appearance of a great step forward, an achievement for Bush on the order of Oslo.
Abbas says he would reject it as a trap, a version of what Sharon calls a "long-term interim agreement" that would defer resolution of the toughest issues.
Abbas thinks it could create a state that hopscotched from Gaza through enclaves on the West Bank, while downgrading the conflict to just another border dispute and releasing international pressure on Israel for further concessions.
From a historical perspective, it is an astounding possibility: that Ariel Sharon could wind up insisting on a Palestinian state over the objections of a Palestinian leader.
If Bush backs it, it may be an offer Abbas cannot refuse.
Sharon's aides say that he believes a long-term interim arrangement will allow the adversaries to cool off and learn to live together.
As time goes by, they say, the precise borders will matter less.
Yet the historical pattern is the opposite.
It is when Palestinians are feeling rested and prosperous that their political demands come once more to the fore.
Nation-building makes people impatient for national liberation.
Like other Palestinians, Hawashin is already anticipating the fire next time.
"There will be another intifada, of course," he told me.
The Palestinians will once again be ruled by their hearts, not their heads, he said, and in their hearts they will never surrender.
"I don't consider myself a defeated person," Hawashin said.
"I consider myself a weak person."
I left Jenin by crossing through the barrier at the town's edge.
It looked, as the major checkpoints increasingly do, like an international border crossing.
From up there, it must all look so peaceful and sensible: Israelis on one side, Palestinians on the other, a bright, sharp line in between.

The numbers on inflows of foreign capital are being watched closely in the foreign exchange and bond markets because the United States current-account deficit is growing rapidly.
It has to be covered by inflows of capital from abroad and if those capital flows slow, the dollar could fall and interest rates rise.
For 2004, the current-account deficit -- the gap in the trade of goods and services that the United States has with the world -- is expected to be around $650 billion, a record.
The fourth-quarter data, which will round out the year, is due today.
Asian central banks, which have been big buyers of Treasury securities, have slowed their purchases or have been sellers of American securities.
So investors have been waiting to see if private investors would pick up the slack.

In her first weeks on the job, Ms. Rice has taken pains to put her own stamp on diplomacy and the American image abroad.

Yet perhaps not since Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara left the Pentagon at the height of the Vietnam war to take up the World Bank presidency and the fight against global poverty has a top Washington policy maker undertaken such a bold shift.
The first Iraqi elections and other positive developments in the Middle East mean Mr. Wolfowitz and his allies can claim a measure of success in their single-minded focus on toppling Saddam Hussein.
"There is a logic to it, though it's not the McNamara logic," said Stephen R. Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who worked as a planner for Mr. Wolfowitz.

Mr. Bush is famous for his loyalty to those who are loyal to him, but the idea of nominating Mr. Wolfowitz to a cabinet post was all but out of the question.
Senate confirmation hearings would be bruising at best, re-opening raw arguments about flaws in prewar intelligence, troop strength after the fall of Baghdad and Mr. Wolfowitz's disproved prediction that the postwar occupation would go smoothly and could be easily financed with Iraqi oil revenues.

So Mr. Bush has now sent Mr. Wolfowitz to shake up the world of international economic development in some of the same ways that he and Mr. Rumsfeld have sought to shake up American military and foreign policy.
One of Mr. Wolfowitz's associates, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to steal the spotlight, said he expected Mr. Wolfowitz would continue the anticorruption efforts of the departing president, James D. Wolfensohn, and demand fresh accountability from governments that receive aid.

"Corruption was high on Wolfensohn's agenda, and Wolfowitz has been very, very impressed by that," the associate said.
Mr. Sestanovich said that Mr. Wolfowitz would come to his new job "with a particular argument about what makes development work, and that is that democratization is part of modernization."
He added: "What has bothered people about the bank for the many decades it has existed is the concern that it has just fed the preoccupations and prejudices and bank accounts of corrupt elites in backward countries.
And the Bush administration comes at that problem with a particular focus on governance, and even more narrowly on democracy, that is going to stir the place up."

"It is all very dynamic, and to take this dynamic thing and translate it into actual average returns is impossible," said Thomas Trabucco, chief spokesman for the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which administers the accounts.
"You have to go case by case."

President Bush holds up the federal savings program as a model for the retirement accounts he wants to add to Social Security.
He is counting on those accounts to earn enough to offset the cuts that his plan calls for in the current fixed Social Security pensions.
The federal thrift plan, however, differs in an essential way from the retirement accounts that the president wants to carve out of Social Security.
The thrift accounts are on top of a generous fixed pension for federal employees, while President Bush's proposal envisions the accounts replacing a substantial part of Social Security's fixed pension.
The thrift system functions like a 401(k)-type plan.
Each of the five funds in the plan has done well enough to meet President Bush's minimum goal of an average annual return of 3 percent, adjusted for inflation.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Over the 18-year life of the plan, even the most conservative fund, invested in Treasury bonds, has returned, on average, 6.6 percent annually before inflation, partly because the fees are kept below what Wall Street charges.
(That compares with an annual inflation rate in that period of nearly 3 percent.)
Near the high end, a fund that tracks the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had an average return of 12 percent a year.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The last 18 years, however, are not a template for the future.
Nor do the performances of the five funds mirror the actual experiences of individual investors.
Whether a federal employee can earn more than Mr. Bush's inflation-adjusted 3 percent a year over a 30-year to 40-year career depends on the mix of investments that the employee chooses and, above all, on a factor beyond anyone's control: the behavior of stocks and bonds.

"The last two decades have been fantastic for the markets, which does not necessarily mean that the next two decades will be as good, or good at all," said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School and the author of "Stocks for the Long Run" (McGraw-Hill, 2002).
Many investors in the thrift accounts have hurt themselves.

"We have always known that people tend to put more money into the stock market toward the peak and are scared out when the market starts to drop," Mr. Siegel said.
"What they should do is sell stock as the market rises and hold on when it slides.
Just buying and holding and not getting scared is a sound plan."

The president's calculations also do not address another issue that government officials have raised, which is the danger that a worker approaching retirement with, say, $200,000 in his savings account might suddenly lose 30 percent or 40 percent of that amount in a market plunge and no longer have the time to recover the loss.

"The real risk is that someone is holding an investment and it goes down at the wrong moment, just as they are approaching retirement," said Patrick Purcell, a specialist in social legislation at the Congressional Research Service.
Under President Bush's proposal, people would be asked, in effect, to take some of their Social Security payroll tax and invest it in the expectation that the return would be enough to offset the money diverted to the private accounts.
A smaller return would reduce retirement income below the present level of Social Security pensions.

Whatever the outcome, adding private accounts does not overcome any benefit cuts that might be imposed to help close the long-term financing gap facing the Social Security system.

At the time, many companies were offering fixed corporate pensions, which they increasingly supplemented with 401(k) plans.
Ms. Barnett, 37, currently contributes 10 percent of her $52,000 salary to her thrift account, and the government, as an incentive, matches the first 5 percent.
She could put in as much as 14 percent, but she is divorced, raising two children and her expenses are high.

She considers herself a smart, if cautious, investor.
Right now, she has 50 percent of her $39,600 in a Treasury fund and 30 percent in a nearly-as-safe fixed-income bond fund.
Only 20 percent is invested in a stock fund, and 10 years before she retires she plans to shift that money into the Treasury fund, she said.
The thrift investment board applauds that sort of behavior.
To encourage it, the board intends to offer later this year a new investment option, called a life-cycle fund.
As an investor ages, it automatically shifts the mix from riskier stocks with their potentially higher returns to a safer and steadier investment in government securities.
It is also intended to correct for too much caution when workers are young.

Too much money channeled into Treasury securities defeats a goal of the accounts that Mr. Bush is proposing.
The Social Security Administration already invests its payroll tax revenue in Treasury bonds.
The retirement accounts in a changed Social Security system are supposed to beat the return on these ultrasafe investments to justify the risk.
But he could have done even better, he says.
Through all the years of saving, Mr. Strombotne kept the money in the Treasury fund, not thinking interest rates would stay so low or stocks would do so well.
"I am a Depression baby and a conservative investor for the most part," he said, "and after the stock market crash in 1987, it certainly would make you cautious about investing in stocks."

By contrast, Mr. O'Dell put much of his money in a stock fund.
From 2001 to 2003, he contributed 10 percent of his annual salary, which is now $41,000.

"With me being my age, I think I'll leave the money in the stock fund," Mr. O'Dell said.
Still another issue in setting up private Social Security accounts is resistance to change.
Mr. Bush's proposals would allow people to stay with the present system or switch to his new mix of a fixed pension supplemented by a private account.
More than 97 percent declined to switch, among them Edwin Dean, a senior economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics earning in the low six figures.
The old system offered larger fixed pensions for higher-income workers, including Mr. Dean.
If they had made the switch, they would have had to make up the difference through the thrift savings accounts.

"We've discovered in behavioral economics that people don't want to get rich with their retirement money," said Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at the University of Notre Dame.

The realities of the second destructive wave -- polarization -- are also widely recognized.
They can be measured by the increase in party-line voting in Congress, the bitter political atmosphere in Washington, the political segmentation of media outlets and the emergence of rigid donor and activist bases in each party that use their power to inflict Stalinist party-line orthodoxy on potentially independent leaders.
We're seeing polarization in action in the Social Security debate.
It's a straightforward problem compared with Medicare, but Congress is deadlocked.
We see polarization in action in the looming fight over judges, which is producing talk about nuclear options and threats to shut down the Senate.

Over the next several years, the parties will differ violently over what to do about the entitlement problem while doing very little to actually address it.
This past Thursday the Senate even rejected a proposal that would have made a sliver of a trim in the growth of Medicaid.
But over time, the entitlements crisis will begin to transform politics.
The parties will grow less cohesive.
The Democrats are held together by the common goal of passing domestic programs that address national needs -- like covering the uninsured.
But with all the money going to cover entitlements, there will be no way to afford new proposals.
Republicans, meanwhile, owe their recent victories to the popularity of tax cuts.
But those will be impossible, too.
Both parties will lose a core reason for being.

Fed policy makers are expected to raise their benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter point for the seventh time since June.
That would put their federal funds rate target at 2.75 percent.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
By the end of June, Fed policy makers will have met three more times, and if they continue at a quarter-point pace, their benchmark rate will be at 3.5 percent.
By then, the next big Fed debate will be well under way.
The argument will be over the definition of a neutral federal funds rate -- the level at which Fed monetary policy is neither stimulating nor slowing economic growth.
One reason the debate is important is that Fed policy makers could decide to stop at neutral if there is no threat from inflation.

The range of opinions on neutral range far and wide, but under most definitions 3.5 percent is getting close, if not actually there.

Fed officials, of course, will not say what the number is, in part because economic conditions are always changing.
And setting a number would put policy makers "in a box," says Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP.

Ben S. Bernanke, a Fed governor, did say this about a neutral fed funds rate in a speech on March 8: "The funds rate will have reached an appropriate and sustainable level when, first, the outlook is consistent with the committee's economic goals and, second, the slope of the term structure of interest rates is approximately normal, as best as can be determined.
With this definition in mind, one can search for indications of where the 'neutral' funds rate is likely to be at a given point in time."

Mr. Crandall, whose job is to understand Fed-speak, translated Mr. Bernanke's definition of a neutral fed funds rate this way: "They'll know it when they see it."
If that is the case, then 3.5 percent could be very close to neutral.

Over the last six weeks, a jury in a federal court in Chicago has heard evidence in Jam Productions' lawsuit against Clear Channel, asserting that Clear Channel, the bigger company, used its leverage to illegally block Jam from becoming the sponsor of Supercross.
The trial has offered an unusual glimpse into the business practices of Clear Channel, the media giant based in San Antonio, that has previously been accused of using hardball tactics to quell challenges by rivals.

But this is the first time a competitor of Clear Channel has actually presented contentions like those to a jury.
Jerry Mickelson, co-owner of Jam Productions, is seeking $32 million damages in lost profit and expenses.
Clear Channel has denied using anticompetitive tactics to battle Jam, characterizing its actions as those of a fierce competitor protecting its turf.
But e-mail messages, handwritten notes and other testimony presented by Jam in the trial portray a picture of Clear Channel executives basically scrambling behind the scenes to hold onto their Supercross business after JamSports and Entertainment, a newly formed unit of Jam Productions, which is based in Chicago, swept onto the scene in late 2001.
A spokeswoman for Clear Channel declined to comment on the case, citing a court order to remain silent.
A jury of nine women and one man began deliberating on Thursday.

If Clear Channel loses the case, other rivals may be emboldened to challenge the company's dominance.
Several legal specialists say a ruling against Clear Channel could also invite more scrutiny from the Justice Department, which is already investigating antitrust accusations against the company in two other instances, including one case involving whether Clear Channel has limited radio airplay of artists who do not book their concerts with Clear Channel promoters.

In early November 2001, Paradama Productions, a unit of the American Motorcyclist Association, the sport's main sanctioning body, signed a letter of intent with Jam to be the tour's promoter from 2003 to 2009.
And while Supercross generally makes up less than 1 percent of Clear Channel's annual operating income of $1.6 billion, its 15 annual events have pulled in up to 35 percent of its motor sports division's net profits in recent years.

After the association entered into a 90-day exclusivity period with Jam, Clear Channel went to work trying to derail Jam's deal, according to testimony from Clear Channel executives.
Shortly after Allen Becker's e-mail message was distributed, Clear Channel executives set about trying to influence the motorcycle manufacturer representatives who make up the boards of Paradama and the American Motorcyclist Association.
In a Dec. 2, 2001, e-mail message, Charles Mancuso, president of Clear Channel's motor sports division, wrote Brian Becker that "we need to figure out how to apply pressure" to a trustee, even though trustees were barred from discussing the Jam deal during the 90-day exclusivity period.

One Clear Channel ally, Fred Bramblett, whose business representing motorcycle riders had received a $500,000 loan from Clear Channel in late 2001, fed Clear Channel executives intelligence about Paradama trustees, and, after striking his deal with Clear Channel, he even offered to buy Paradama, according to testimony from Mr. Mancuso.
Clear Channel executives also seized on the idea of applying international pressure to scuttle the Jam deal.
Clear Channel managers then set about booking Supercross races sanctioned by the international group on the same days as races sanctioned by the American association.
They figured they could pressure the American association to back out of the Jam deal and go back to Clear Channel once the group realized it was in jeopardy of being expelled from the international organization for violating its rules by having races on the same day, according to testimony from Clear Channel executives and a Paradama executive.

The strategy seemed to work.
On Dec. 31, 2001, Mr. Mancuso sent an e-mail message to his boss at Clear Channel Sports about a newspaper article discussing Clear Channel's successful pact with the international group.
Mr. Mancuso wrote that Mr. Bramblett and another ally believed "this is checkmate."
Shorenstein's role as the city's top landlord has now been assumed by Equity Office Properties, the nation's largest owner of office real estate.
But Equity Office has put five of its buildings here on the market, in the hope of either selling them outright or forming joint ventures with other investors.

Nearly $2 billion worth of prime office buildings changed hands in 2004, exceeding the 1998 record of $1.92 billion, with some properties drawing as many as two dozen bids.
The average price for all buildings in the central business district was $304 a square foot last year, up from $235 a square foot in 2003, according to Reis Inc., a New York research firm.
Several buildings have traded for $400 a square foot or more, including 555 California Street, which is no longer the national headquarters of Bank of America but has a roster of blue-chip tenants, including Goldman Sachs.

In this city, by contrast, some brokers estimate that the top buildings have a vacancy rate of 19 percent, with most of the empty space on the lower floors.

The spike in commercial real estate prices here has left many real estate specialists scratching their heads.
For the last year and a half, landlords in San Francisco have gained more new tenants than they have lost, but new leases are being signed at 1997 levels, with owners paying $35 or more a square foot to help with remodeling.
"We're still seeing $50 worth of work and a year's worth of free rent," said Jacque Ducharme, a vice chairman at Studley, a real estate firm that represents tenants.

Although rents for the more desirable space on higher floors are slowly inching up -- sometimes reaching $40 a square foot -- space below is getting $25 to $30.
On average, rents are 45.4 percent of what they were at their peak in 2000, according to Moody's Investors Service.

"What we are seeing is a further widening of the spread between rents for view space and nonview space," said Michael van Konynenburg, the chief executive of Secured Capital, which has represented landlords in several recent high-priced sales.

Jeanne R. Myerson, the chief executive of the Swig Company, a private company based in San Francisco that has real estate holdings across the country, has been looking for properties to buy here.
But she said that the high prices suggest that many buyers are overly optimistic that there will be enough job growth to drive up rents.
"It's hard to make the numbers work on a lot of the buildings right now," she said.
This is hardly the only real estate market currently attractive to investors, in light of low interest rates, the sluggish stock market and the widespread availability of cheap capital.
With a lack of alternative investment vehicles, many people are willing to accept much lower initial returns than they were a few years ago, hoping for greater cash flow in the future.

Steel and concrete prices have been rising, adding to the cost of developing new buildings so that any price that is safely below the so-called replacement cost -- as much as $450 a square foot in this city -- can look like a good deal.
In a report issued last week, however, Moody's said the city is the riskiest major office market in the country.
The ratings agency warned that many tenants here were still paying high rents negotiated during the technology boom and would expect a sharp reduction when their leases expire.

"The point is that rents could be stable for the next three years, and then cash flow could decline materially," said Sally Gordon, a vice president and senior credit officer.
"We're alerting people to the fact that you might see an increase in defaults."
Few real estate specialists doubt that this city will rebound in the long run, both because it appeals to highly educated people willing to make sacrifices to live here and because it is hard to build here.
An initiative approved in 1986 limits commercial high-rise construction to 875,000 square feet a year.

In fact, apart from a jazzy federal building rising at Seventh and Mission Streets, no office buildings are currently under construction, although the city is awash in residential projects and several lower-grade office buildings are being converted into condominiums.
Owners with lots authorized for commercial construction say they will not build until they can charge $65 a square foot annually for rent, utilities and services.

No longer the financial capital it once was, this city now relies mainly on smaller tenants -- advertising agencies, boutique law firms and hedge funds -- to fill its office towers.
Unlike the corporate tenants of the past, who were willing to put their back-office employees on lower floors, many smaller businesses insist on giving everyone access to a view, making it hard to find takers for much of the ordinary space, said Jim Sullivan, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif.

Because of the growing premium paid for view space, a current owner of Market Center, Divco West Properties, a real estate firm based in Palo Alto, said it was not in a rush to lease the top floors of the building, which is now more than half full.
"We're holding out for better rents on the upper floors," said Stephen J. Pilch, the chief operating officer.
The building is in a once-seedy neighborhood, sometimes known as SoMa, that blossomed with new office buildings during the technology boom.
In moving to the city, Gymboree sublet space from Sun Microsystems, the building's sole tenant.
Equity Office, which has withdrawn from markets like Philadelphia, is not giving up on this city, although it wants to limit its holdings to properties it considers strategic, especially those with great views, said Jeffrey L. Johnson, the chief investment officer.

But Kevin Brennan, a senior vice president at the Staubach Company, which represents tenants, said that the sell-off by Shorenstein and Equity Office should serve as a warning to other potential investors.
"We don't see where the market is going to be tightening anytime soon," he said.
The report came a day after the Federal Reserve, in raising interest rates for the seventh time in less than a year, expressed greater concern about the risk of higher inflation, citing evidence that some businesses are gaining increased "pricing power" in the marketplace.

Including energy and food costs, average prices are now 3 percent above their level a year earlier.
Some consumer prices have risen even faster.
Medical costs are 4.3 percent higher than a year ago; hotel rates have gained 7.3 percent; prices of dairy products are up 5.6 percent.

Indeed, the value of the dollar against the euro and the yen rose in currency markets yesterday, with investors betting that the Fed's tougher language suggests it might be more aggressive about fighting inflation with higher interest rates.
In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond, after initially falling in value, ended trading in New York up slightly; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 4.59 percent, from 4.64 percent Tuesday.
Inflation has been slowly building for many months.
Import prices have risen over the last two years, as the dollar has declined, relieving some pressure on domestic manufacturers to keep prices down.

Moreover, from the prices of raw materials, which have risen 11 percent over the last 12 months, to the price of finished products at the factory gate, up 5 percent, producer prices have been rising considerably faster than the Consumer Price Index.

Judging from the grumbling, some riders believed that the conductor had gone out of his way to make them miserable.
Mild paranoia?
Maybe.
Then again, maybe not.
As we said, this is a sadly familiar tale.
So here is some unsolicited advice for Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit:
Even if some of your loudest critics are politicians capitalizing on your system's recent woes, plenty of your customers are fed up with paying more while sensing that they get less.
Clearly, you need many billions to keep the system in proper shape; the exact amount is for the politicians to hash out.
But you might gain a measure of customer sympathy through small changes that cost nothing or close to it.

Hint: gratuitously closing doors on people is not the way to go.
Mr. Reuter's response to his critics is to blame higher rider expectations.
The subways, he suggested this week, are so much better than they were 20 years ago that New Yorkers are less tolerant when things go wrong.

No question, service is light-years ahead of what it was in the early 1980's.
Subway stations are far more attractive.

Unfortunately for Mr. Reuter, many of today's New Yorkers were living elsewhere or were not yet born 20 years ago.
So telling them about the bad old days is limited as a form of persuasion.
There are other ways to win friends, though.
They involve actions, not words, and would not seem to require gobs of money.

Do the doors between train cars have to be locked, as they are more and more?
Locking the doors is billed as a safety measure.
But it permits no escape from intolerable smells or balky air-conditioning.
It may also be a safety hazard of its own, as a woman we know discovered while riding the V train one recent night.

Must the trains be turned into freight carriers?
Can't station managers refuse to open the gates, at least during peak hours, to people who want to bring oversized objects on board, from steamer trunks to refrigerators?
Do subway announcements have to be garbled?
Can't conductors be encouraged to speak straight English instead of insider jargon like, "We're being held by supervision"?
And is there a rule forbidding the station clerk to notify riders that there is a problem with the trains before they pass through the turnstiles?
The list could go on.
Not that any of it deals with the bigger picture of making the trains run on time.
But isn't it just possible that riders would be more understanding about inevitable glitches if stations seem orderly and train doors are not needlessly slammed in their faces?

Evidence of the divergent paths is in the type of partners the two big lenders have taken on so far.
American Express has signed deals with two of the largest card banks, Citibank and MBNA, both known for their affluent clientele and high credit standards.
Discover, by contrast, has started working with Wal-Mart Stores and GE Consumer Finance; last month the General Electric unit, which serves a broad range of the credit spectrum, started issuing a card for Wal-Mart customers on Discover's network.
A card from Sam's Club, a Wal-Mart unit, will make its debut next month.
Discover and American Express both say they anticipate many more such deals.
There has never been a debit card with a Discover logo on the front, but Discover says there will be one soon.

MBNA used to issue only the MasterCard and Visa brands; today, the company says it has distributed several hundred thousand cards with the American Express name.

But J.P. Morgan Chase, now the world's largest card issuer, has stuck with tradition.
The bank said recently that it would continue to work with both MasterCard and Visa, taking actions that show some slight favoritism toward Visa.

Visa and MasterCard, for their part, say they are neither surprised nor concerned that some of their members might want to try something new.
Soaring growth in both credit and debit use means there will be an ever-growing pie, they say, and the steady migration to cards from cash and checks is as important as the competitive jockeying.
Kenneth I. Chenault, American Express's chief executive, spelled out what these trends mean for his company.
"It's not just a situation of saying, I want to take share, which I absolutely do, from MasterCard and Visa, but I also want to grow substantially," he said in a recent interview.
To do that, he added, he needs to "get a greater percentage of your spending that is currently on cash and checks to move over to American Express."
American Express's abandonment of efforts that distracted it from its focus on its cards franchise underscores its plan to concentrate intensely on customers who spend a lot and do it with payment cards.

"I believe that American Express provides a tremendous opportunity to those banks that are focused on the payments sector," Mr. Chenault said.

Relations between merchants and card companies are never that close, with the retailers perpetually piqued by the fees they must pay.
American Express charges the most, contending that it offers superior service and a cachet brand.
Visa and MasterCard come next in the pecking order, with fees that tend to be at rough parity.
Discover is the bargain brand.

This hierarchy has emerged from the quirky dynamics of the card business.
American Express and Discover run what are known as "closed loop" networks -- they both sign up merchants and issue the cards to consumers.
Visa and MasterCard are governed by their bank members; the banks issue the cards, and the associations run the networks and set fee prices for the merchants.
The distinctions have started to blur, however, as a result of the industry's new configuration.
As time goes on, the closed-loop model may well emerge as a big advantage, analysts said.
"American Express is, in our view, uniquely positioned to serve the high-volume transactors because they are able to charge a higher fee to the merchant," said David Hochstim, an analyst at Bear Stearns who covers the company.
"Are we curious about what American Express is doing?
"Did we expect there would be some level of experimentation?
Of course."
"I don't look at it as a big sea change for Visa," he said.
"I'm very comfortable with where our brand is."
Melvin A. Schwarz, who was the government's lead prosecutor and who now practices at a firm in Washington, said that "things are playing out the way we'd hoped."
As credit offers proliferate, however, the products are looking more and more alike: low teaser interest rates, lots of rewards, an attractive piece of plastic.

"It just simply cannot get much better."
Bridgewater says it believes that the dollar is already beyond the point of no return.
To keep the currency at its current value, private investors will have to buy more American securities as central banks desert them, said Robert P. Prince, the firm's co-chief investment officer.
Before private investors will act, they need to see a higher return from American assets, relative to assets carrying similar risks abroad.

Mr.
If an asset comes with a fixed interest payment, say 4 percent, buying it at a lower price will offer a relatively higher return.
But these higher returns could cause problems for the economy.
Borrowers in the competitive market for credit will have to offer higher returns, too, and interest rates may rise.
"The Fed doesn't want that, because too much of a rise in interest rates will choke off the economy," Mr.
The alternative is for the assets' prices to remain the same while the dollar loses value.
That way, foreigners will be able to buy assets at a discount, yielding a higher return, but without putting too much upward pressure on American interest rates.
(The implicit assumption here is that the assets' future returns will not be harmed too much by today's lower dollar.)
So, instead of allowing the economy to adjust purely through higher interest rates, perhaps causing another recession, Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve will have the luxury of allowing the dollar to do some of the heavy lifting.
The numbers?
Bridgewater predicts a further decline in the dollar of 30 percent, especially against Asian currencies, and a rise in American long-term rates of one-half to one full percentage point.

Not everyone thinks that events will play out this way.
"It's really too extreme to be talking about potential crises in the dollar," said Martin D.D.
Evans, a professor of economics at Georgetown University in Washington.
"Yes, we have seen a large movement in the dollar versus the euro in particular, but to say we're sort of on the edge of a precipice isn't really merited by the facts.
The premise here, thinking that it's impossible for the dollar to come back, I also don't buy."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Professor Evans said the Fed's hand would be forced by the rising tide of inflation.
"The Federal Reserve cares about inflation," he said, "and they're going to be very reluctant if they start seeing the inflationary effects of the decline in the dollar to just sit by and say, 'But we need low interest rates to support exports."'
He predicted that the Fed would put the clamps on credit, leading to interest rates high enough to attract foreign capital: "We are going to see quite a sharp tightening in the United States, perhaps tighter than people are expecting."

Drastic predictions for the government's fiscal position may not come true, either, even though the White House's budget would raise the debt-to-G.D.P.
ratio in 2015 to 37 percent, versus 29 percent under current law.
"I don't think it's big enough to warrant the attention it's gotten," Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said of the nation's fiscal erosion.
"A lot of the dollar's future will in fact be driven by the other determinants."

That does not mean the budget can be ignored.
"It is unavoidable that we will rein in our spending," he said, "because we are unlikely to be able to tax enough to cover it."
Though action by the Fed and a clampdown on federal spending could spare the dollar's blushes, they would both be bad news for the economy.
A cutback in federal spending will, at least in the short term, create slack in labor and product markets.
And one of the surest forecasters of recession is a tightening of short-term credit by the Fed.
Congress and the White House have shown no sign that they are serious about controlling spending, but the Fed's policy-making committee may already be proving Professor Evans right.
Whichever way you cut it, we're in for a bumpy ride.
The debate over whether doctors should reinsert the feeding tube that has been Ms. Schiavo's lifeline for the past 15 years reached a high point last week, and churchgoers at Easter services across the country said that they had found themselves pondering more deeply than in years past what it means to be alive or dead, and what kind of control people should have over life's end.

"I don't think it's a bad thing to discuss it," said Bill Spain, who had gathered with his family for a sunrise Mass, led by priests from St. Brigid's Roman Catholic Church in South Boston, at Castle Island, a peninsula that juts into Boston Harbor.
"That's what makes our nation great: we take an issue and debate it.
It's finding that spot, that spot that makes it work for everybody, that is probably going to be somewhat elusive."

Father Pope, in fact, included a flier in the Easter service bulletin about artificial feeding and a statement made last week by Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, the archbishop of Washington, that providing the feeding tube to Ms. Schiavo was "morally obligatory."
"Terri Schiavo deserves to end her suffering on this earth and go to a better place just like Jesus did," Ms. Zacharias said.

The United States has far better ways to reward Pakistan for its helpful but selective pressure on Al Qaeda and the Taliban than President Bush's decision last week to break with 15 years of policy and sell Pakistan high-performance fighters whose only plausible use is to threaten India.

It compounds it.
The worst thing for these two nuclear powers, which have fought three wars against each other since 1947, is to encourage them to engage in a new, American-fueled arms race.
The United States does have a compelling strategic interest in helping Pakistan.
But the right kind of help does not consist of selling Pakistan's armed forces, led by the country's military dictator, President Pervez Musharraf, prestigious, expensive and dangerous weapons systems.
Decades of swollen military budgets have virtually bankrupted Pakistan, leaving its government unable to afford adequate spending on education and job-creating economic modernization.
Instead, its leaders have fed the Pakistani people a diet of belligerent nationalism and projects like nuclear weapons that are designed to enhance a sense of prestige.
In this environment, civilian democracy has never struck deep roots, military takeovers have been common, and recruitment for a variety of groups preaching armed Islamist jihad has thrived.
General Musharraf likes to advertise his occasional attacks on the most terrifying symptoms of this syndrome.
He is far less willing to strike at its sources by pushing Pakistan toward development and democracy and far too eager to drain its resources on supersonic attack jets.
In reviewing the new Pakistan arms sale policy, which overturns a 15-year-old ban imposed over concerns about Pakistani nuclear weapons activity, Congress should think hard about the messages the United States wants to send to future proliferators.
Pakistan developed nuclear weapons of its own after refusing to sign international nonproliferation treaties.
Worse, it has spread nuclear weapons technology to Iran, North Korea, Libya and who knows what other countries, through the rogue network that was run by its top government nuclear scientist, A.Q.
Khan.
Advocates of these military sales will argue, as they always do, that if the United States did not sell Pakistan and India advanced fighter jets, other countries would.
That is probably true, but it is not a justification for fueling an arms race.
One big reason both governments want to buy American planes is to advertise to their own people and the world that their costly military spending enjoys the full backing of Washington.
That alone is reason enough to regret Mr. Bush's decision.
Most embarrassing, perhaps, at least six of the gunmen were members of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, which is linked to Yasir Arafat's Fatah movement.

The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 99.46 points.
The nation lost about 2.7 million jobs during and after the recession of 2001, and employment has recovered in fits and starts in the last two years.
About 3.1 million jobs have been added since May 2003, and the unemployment rate has declined from a high of 6.3 percent.
But wages have not kept up with inflation, suggesting that workers still have little bargaining power even as corporate profits have soared.

The Fed has pushed short-term rates up in baby steps since last June, from 1 percent to 2.75 percent.
But its new warning about inflation, and a jump in consumer prices in February, raised fears that it would either move faster or keep raising rates longer than expected.
Analysts said Friday's report of modest growth in employment would allow the Fed to stick to its gradual pace of quarter-point increases at each of its policy meetings.

The most immediate potential concern is rising oil prices, which have climbed by 36 percent this year and hit a record on Friday of $57.27.
Rising gasoline prices weakened consumer spending last summer, though economic growth continued to be strong throughout 2004, and some forecasters worry about a slowdown this summer.

The University of Michigan's monthly index of consumer confidence, released on Friday, declined slightly, to 92.6 in March from 94.1 in February.

Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig/ITG, said companies were investing more of their money and earning more of their profits outside the United States.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"What we're seeing is very strong profit growth, but pedestrian gains for investment and employment," Mr. Barbera said.
The reason, he said, is that American direct investment overseas is much higher than foreign direct investment in the United States.
The United States' widening trade deficit is a reflection of the growing reliance on foreign manufacturers.
"Clearly, consumers continue to demand manufactured goods," wrote Jared Bernstein, economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington.
"But as shown by the growing trade deficit and loss of manufacturing jobs, their demands are being met by imports."
But the advantages are prized right now because these bonds -- often found in the municipal bond market -- tend to be resistant to some of the usual ill effects of rising interest rates.
For this reason, they are often called cushion bonds.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In fact, managers of intermediate and long-term municipal bond funds have been buying premium callable bonds in big dollops for the last two years, said Eric Jacobson, senior analyst at Morningstar.
One manager with a big position in these bonds is Joseph P. Deane, who oversees $19 billion in municipal bond funds for Smith Barney Asset Management in New York and says he believes that interest rates will keep climbing.
Mr. Deane has been selling securities that are sensitive to rising rates since early 2004, raising cash, buying futures contracts that provide a hedge against rate increases -- and buying premium callable bonds.
"Most of the bonds left in our portfolios are premium callable bonds," he said.
"These are very defensive pieces of paper."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The defensive characteristics of such bonds are found primarily in two features.
One is that their coupons -- higher than those of comparable bonds -- put cash into investors' hands faster.
That lessens the bonds' vulnerability to interest rate changes.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And the fact that the bonds are callable also gives them some defensive properties, at least for a while.
As long as a bond's coupon is above current market rates, its price will be based on its call date, not its maturity date.
This gives the bond the lower interest rate sensitivity of a bond with a shorter maturity.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That is because a premium callable bond, under these circumstances, is likely to be called by its issuer as soon as the terms of the bond permit.
After all, a new bond, with a lower yield, will be cheaper for the issuer than the premium bond.
"The nice thing about premium callable bonds is they combine the higher yields of long-term bonds with the interest rate sensitivity of intermediate bonds," said James M. Murphy, manager of the T. Rowe Price Tax-Free High Yield fund.
"As long as they are priced at a premium, you get the best of both worlds."
But there is a pitfall, and it can be fairly steep.
If interest rates rise high enough so that the bond's coupon no longer is higher than the market's, the bond's value can plummet.
Its price will then be based not on its call but rather its final maturity date.
(That is because it wouldn't be in the interest of a bond's issuer to call a bond with a low coupon; new bonds would be more expensive for the issuer.)

"When these bonds get close to par is when you start getting big swings in interest rate sensitivity," said Mr. Jacobson at Morningstar.
"Some managers go out of their way to stay away from these situations."

David Fare, co-manager with Mr. Deane of the Smith Barney Managed Municipals fund, says he is prepared to handle this problem for bonds in the fund's portfolio.
"The cushion is built-in only until prevailing interest rates reach the coupon value of the bond," he said.
"But, we can manage that risk.
As a bond nears trading to its coupon, we'll sell it and buy another premium bond that still has a cushion in it."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That requires close attention to the portfolio and to shifts in the market -- which may be difficult for nonprofessionals.
"The idea is to come up with a solution to a rising interest rate environment," he said.
"We're trying to insulate the market value of our portfolio while continuing to provide people with tax-free income."
Another risk in buying callable bonds at a premium is that the bond may be called at par shortly after purchase.
That can leave investors with a loss.
New York City is in the process of redeeming at par $426 million in muni bonds that had been bought by some investors at premiums last year.

"Anytime you're paying a premium for a bond, you should have a very specific understanding as to what type of call protection you're getting," Mr. Murphy said.
"If you're going to pay a premium, you need to know it will not be called unexpectedly."
Some individual investors balk at paying extra cash for a premium bond, but the fatter coupons ultimately should make up for the higher initial outlay, said Christopher Genovese, first vice president at Fixed Income Securities L.P. in Melville, N.Y., which provides bond portfolio analysis and recommendations to financial advisers.

THE best way to evaluate a bond, Mr. Jacobson, said, is to compare its yield to call and yield to maturity with other, similar bonds.
These calculations require some work -- they are available from financial advisers and on bond information Web sites -- and they take into account what the investor paid for the bond and its expected income stream.
"You have to decide whether the defensive characteristics are worth the initially lower yield," said Paul Disdier, manager of the Dreyfus Municipal Bond fund, which holds premium callable bonds.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Given the complexities of these bonds and the trouble of evaluating them, many individual investors may be better off leaving bond buying to a professional -- a financial adviser, a mutual fund manager or both.
Still, given the prevalence of premium callable bonds in the muni bond market as well as the benefits, it pays to be up to speed on their nuances, Mr. Murphy said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"It's fine to pay a premium for a bond; the yield will be roughly comparable" to a bond selling at par or a slight discount, he said.
"But, if you need to sell the bond," he added, "the premium will give you better protection in a rising rate environment."
An appreciation for the environmental factors that influence childhood weight gain leads logically to suggestions for how to help an already overweight child grow into his or her weight.

Healthy overweight children should never be put on weight-loss diets, which can compromise nutrition and normal growth.
Nor should attention to weight issues override love, acceptance and a genuine appreciation for a child's talents and accomplishments.
Learning When to Stop
Children start life with parents or caretakers in control of their food supply.
But what many adults fail to appreciate is that "parents are responsible for the what, when and where of feeding" whereas "children are responsible for the how much and whether of eating," Ellyn Satter, a family therapist and feeding specialist in Madison, Wis., writes in her new book, "Your Child's Weight: Helping Without Harming (Kelcy Press, $19.95).
Children must learn to eat in response to hunger and to stop eating when that hunger is satisfied.
Parents who "push" food, who repeatedly urge children to eat when they are not hungry, take one more bite or clean their plates are teaching children to ignore hunger and satiety as signals to eat and stop eating.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Also, when food is imbued with values beyond supplying nutrients and satisfying hunger, the stage is set for problems.
For example, I learned from my grandmother and my parents to associate food and eating with acceptance and love.
When in my 20's I felt lost and unloved, I ate my five-foot frame into a size 14.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
As to the "what" of feeding, it is the parents' job to make a variety of reasonably healthful foods and snacks readily available.
If the house is stocked with cookies, cakes, candies, chips, sodas and ice cream, that's what children will want to eat.
Portion sizes are another important factor.
They have increased enormously, in restaurants and in homes.
It has been demonstrated that children eat more when they are served larger portions.
Better to start small and offer a still smaller portion for seconds on request.
Regular meals are also important, allowing children to acquire an appetite and learn to satisfy it with wholesome food, not snacks.
Regular meals reassure children that they will be fed when they are hungry and allowed to eat as much as they want, reducing the risk that they will stuff themselves, Ms. Satter says.

And at least one family meal a day is helpful.
If a daily family meal cannot be arranged, at least have one or more on the weekend.
All drinks and food should be consumed at the table or snack counter, not in front of the television or computer.
When children are thirsty, they are best given water, milk or 100 percent fruit juice, not soda or fruit drinks.

Children learn to enjoy whatever they are accustomed to eating.
In Costa Rica, they eat rice and beans for breakfast; in Japan, they eat soup, fish and vegetables.
But in America, if breakfast is eaten at all, far too often it is a Pop-Tart, heavily sweetened cereal, Egg McMuffin or other sweet, fatty, high-calorie fare.
Pancakes are fine, but try them with part whole-wheat flour and a mashed banana and serve them with fruited yogurt instead of syrup.

While the usual emphasis should be on healthful foods -- fruits and vegetables, lean meats and poultry, low-fat or nonfat dairy products and whole grain breads and cereals -- no food should be forbidden, except for health reasons like diabetes or gluten intolerance.
A sweet or fatty treat is fine now and then, even every day if amounts are reasonable.
If a food a child enjoys, like candy, chips or ice cream, is totally forbidden, it becomes even more desirable, and the child may start sneaking it whenever a parent's back is turned.
Also, using these foods as rewards will enhance their desirability.

Nor should parents worry about how much cake, candy, ice cream or soda an overweight child consumes at a party.
It would be quite a challenge even for an adult to overeat 3,500 calories at a sitting, the amount in one pound of body fat.
It is generally unwise to call attention, however discreetly, to a child's weight by telling him how much he can eat, whatever the circumstance or the food in question.
Furthermore, restraint nearly always leads to overindulgence at the next opportunity.
Schools these days are no help.
School lunches are often high-fat, fast-food affairs.
And half the nation's school districts have contracts with soft drink companies, which place vending machines in schools.
Parents need to pay more attention to what children consume at school and insist on changes.

No More Couch Potatoes
Most children today get less physical activity -- in school, going to and from school, and at home -- than in years past.
For each hour of exercise a child gets, the risk of obesity drops by 10 percent.
Parents should insist that schools reinstate sports activities for all children, not just elite athletes.
And adults must restrict the hours children spend watching television and playing video games in lieu of outdoor activities like skating, cycling, jumping rope or playing sports.
The rule in my home was "if it's light out, you're out" -- outside playing.

For latchkey children who must stay inside until a parent gets home, an indoor exercise machine, climbing toy or music for dancing can provide some daily physical activity, supplemented by outdoor activities on the weekend.
Televisions do not belong in children's rooms unless the children adhere to the watching schedule established by parents.
Several studies have shown a direct correlation between children's weight and weight gain and the amount of television watched and video games played.
For each hour a day television is watched, the risk of childhood obesity rises by 12 percent.

But over the last decade or so, the riskiest form of the business, known as leveraged lending, has been transformed to an actively traded market.
Besides hedge funds, other large buyers of these loans now include managers of pools of loans known as collateralized loan obligations, which are sold to insurance companies and the like.

But there are concerns that these lenders, in their zeal for high returns, will end up losing much of their money, particularly as rates rise and companies have a harder time paying their debts.
If the value of a company declines sharply, there may not be enough assets to cover the value of the second liens.
In a report in October, Standard & Poor's estimated that investors in second liens could recover less than 25 percent of their principal in the event of a bankruptcy.
"Every lending cycle has its excesses," said Mark L. Gold, a managing director at Trust Company of the West, a longtime investor in bank loans.
"Last cycle it was telecommunications; this time it's second liens."
Mr. Gold and other skeptics point to a second-lien loan made in November 2003 to Atkins Nutritionals, the diet products company founded by Dr. Robert C. Atkins, who promoted a low-carbohydrate diet before his death two years ago.
Bids for its $79 million second-lien loan have fallen to just 15 cents on the dollar, as investors anticipate a bankruptcy filing by the company.

Defenders of second liens argue that hedge funds are well compensated for buying these loans.
"This is a pretty sophisticated bunch," Mr. Pollard of Credit Suisse said.
"Everyone is going into these deals with their eyes wide open."
Buyers of second-lien loans typically receive twice the interest rate paid to holders of first-lien loans by the same company.
Currently, second-lien loans are offering 6.48 percentage points over the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark that borrowers use to reset the rate on their loans.
With the three-month Libor at 3.12 percent, that is a yield of 9.6 percent.
The loans include $150 million in second-lien financing, paying 5.88 percentage points above Libor.

Companies have raised $5 billion through second-lien loans this year through March.
That is on top of a record $12 billion in 2004, or four times the previous year, according to Standard & Poor's LCD, which tracks the loan market.

"That is clearly a company with lots of assets," making this loan less risky than some, said Steven Miller, managing director at Standard & Poor's LCD.
Indeed, many bankers draw a contrast between loans to companies with tangible assets, like Goodyear, and companies like Atkins that are more dependent on the value of a brand name.

Still, even hedge fund managers who are making these loans concede that they are proceeding carefully.
"You need to really understand the value of the collateral and your rights as a creditor," said one fund manager who would not speak for attribution.

Second-lien loans have been a boon for companies like Krispy Kreme that are facing a short-term liquidity squeeze.
The loans became popular two years ago, part of a wave of what bankers refer to as rescue financings.
A series of such deals were done on behalf of utility companies; in the throes of deregulation and tarred by the bankruptcy of Enron, they were having trouble raising funds through the bond market.

But more recently, a rising number of second-lien loans have been used for more aggressive purposes.
Half of the loans so far this year have backed acquisitions or one-time dividend payments to owners of companies, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation, a research firm.
And the ratings on second-lien financings have been falling, with more than a third rated CCC+ and below by S.&P.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Bankers say that some hedge funds are compounding the risks by buying second-lien loans and then borrowing at three to five times the value of the loan.
In certain cases, second-lien loans are taking the place of junk bonds, especially as recent jitters in that market have made it harder for companies to raise money.
Last week, for example, White Birch Paper, a company owned by Peter Brant, the investor and art collector, canceled a $400 million junk bond offering; it is instead raising second-lien loans.
A portion of the money would go to pay off debts of a holding company controlled by Mr. Brant, according to Standard & Poor's LCD.
Still, in some ways, second-lien lenders could be better off than bond buyers.
Because their loans, unlike many junk bonds, are secured by assets, they often have a seat, albeit less of a seat, at the negotiating table with the first-lien lenders.
That could make it harder for a company to write off these debts in the case of bankruptcy, investors said.

"It really depends on how much other debt is ahead of you," said Frederick S. Haddad, a partner at GoldenTree Asset Management, which oversees $7 billion in loans, junk bonds and other investments, and occasionally will buy debt backed by a second lien.

But strong business investment and a quadrupling of central bank reserves in the region since the crisis have insulated countries from economic shocks, he said in releasing the bank's annual forecast at a news conference in Hong Kong.

The economies of Asian developing countries expanded by 7.3 percent last year and can be expected to grow 6.5 percent this year, 6.6 percent next year and 6.9 percent in 2007, the bank said.
Recent signs of economic weakness in the European Union and Japan, together with rising inflationary pressures and the likelihood of higher interest rates in the United States, could result in a sharp slowing in Asian exports of manufactured goods this year, Mr. Ali warned.
But other sectors are doing well, he said, pointing to increased government spending on public works and strong investment by companies.
Its economy seems to be slowing this year after torrid growth over the last several years, he said.
Some of the biggest risks to Asia are the hardest to estimate, he cautioned, adding that "what we have seen emerging with avian flu casts a huge shadow on the region."
Banks are also shifting their attention to the poor because interest rates in Brazil are expected to drop in the coming years as inflation declines and the economy grows robustly.
And as interest rates fall, banks will lose one of their biggest sources of revenue -- trading government bonds indexed to the central bank's overnight lending rate.

"Banks have to look for alternatives to their classic investments in government bonds," said Rodolfo Spielmann, a partner at Bain & Company in São Paulo.
"And they are waking up to the fact that the low-income classes are going to be the biggest source of growth for the future."
The government, too, is doing its part to bring the poor into the banking system.
Under the new rules, banks can set up kiosks and banking terminals in supermarkets and drugstores instead of opening and running new branches.
Because Brazil's banks are highly automated, these terminals tend to be inexpensive to operate, making it easier for banks to get a return on their investment.

To encourage lending to the poor, the government also allowed banks to use up to 2 percent of reserve requirements -- money that would otherwise be parked at the central bank -- to offer low-interest loans to low-income customers.
By law, the interest charged on these loans cannot exceed 2 percent a month, a far cry from the 10 to 12 percent that most Brazilians pay for a consumer loan.

The new regulations set the stage for initiatives like Banco Popular, which was created in February 2004 and already has more than 1.3 million accounts and 6,000 branches.
Caixa Aqui, a similar operation run by the government-controlled Caixa Econômica Federal, has 2.8 million accounts and has lent some 2.5 billion reais ($916 million) in less than two years of existence, all to customers who earn no more than 1,000 reais ($366) a month.

Government banks are not the only ones reaching out to the poor.

Though most of the clients of these banks are unskilled workers with little job stability, their default rate -- 9 percent at Banco Postal, for example -- is not much higher than the market average.
"In our experience, the first chance the customer gets he pays," said Odair Rebelato, an executive director at Banco Postal.
Other banks, like the privately owned Lemon Bank, a small bank based in São Paulo that operates exclusively through automated teller machines in outlets like bakeries and corner stores, are more interested in providing basic financial services than in offering credit.
(In Brazil, bills can be only paid through a bank.)

"There's a lot of romanticizing about credit," said Michael Esrubilsky, Lemon Bank's general manger.
"But what our client really needs is convenience to pay bills, to not have to spend an hour to get to the nearest bank and to not have to spend 10 reais on transportation to get back and forth."

Another way banks are reaching out to the poor is through partnerships with retail chains, which have been offering their own credit to low-income consumers for decades.
And Banco Itaú Holding Financeira, Brazil's No.2 private-sector bank, recently agreed to provide consumer financing for a handful of retailers, including Companhia Brasileira de Distribuição, the leading supermarket chain.
For banks, joining forces with retailers is an easy way to "expand their operations to a broader client base without having to invest in organic growth or in acquisitions," said José Francisco Canepa, the executive director of Itaú's consumer finance unit.

Foreign banks are also joining in.
Citigroup, which has long been considered a bank for the elite in Brazil, is now increasing its lending to the lower middle class through its consumer finance unit, CitiFinancial.
HSBC Holdings, the British banking giant, has been even more aggressive in its quest to win over low-income consumers.
By the end of this year, HSBC expects Losango's credit portfolio to have more than doubled, to $1.7 billion.

She can pay her bills every month at the Banco Popular kiosk in her neighborhood, instead of paying for bus fare to get to the nearest bank in the city.
And in February, Ms. Gouvêa, who is 34, got her first bank loan -- a low-interest advance of 300 reais ($110) to pay some debt and have a bit more money available.

But he and others were quick to dismiss speculation that the shifting performance might be an ominous sign for real estate over all, even though some economists have expressed concerns about the run-up in housing prices.

"There's a lot of talk about a bubble; it doesn't feel like a bubble to me, in a sense like the tech bubble was in 2000," said Daniel McNeela, a senior analyst who follows the real estate industry for Morningstar.
"When a market decides to take a correction," he said, "people tend to sell the things that have done relatively well."
Yet Mr. Cassidy, too, cautioned that some housing markets were showing signs of overheating and could become vulnerable to an economic downturn, especially as interest rates continue to rise.
Higher rates could also hurt the stocks of publicly traded home builders.

Most real estate funds, in fact, owe their success to the strength of REIT's, publicly traded companies with portfolios of real estate -- from shopping centers to hotels to apartment buildings -- that pay out most of their income in dividends.

Not surprisingly, real estate funds with a limited exposure to REIT's managed to buck the downward trend in the last quarter, according to Morningstar.
"I think REIT's will be a little boring this year," said Samuel A. Lieber, the chief executive of Alpine Management and Research and the fund manager for Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity and Alpine International Real Estate.
The Third Avenue Real Estate Value fund, meanwhile, has around 25 percent of its portfolio in REIT's.
The fund has about $2 billion in assets.

Mr. Lieber likes stocks of builders like Pulte Homes, Standard Pacific Homes and Toll Brothers, the top three holdings in Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity.
The three together total 14 percent of the portfolio, which has around $370 million in assets.
Mr. Lieber says he sees continued growth in Pulte, particularly in its Dell Webb division, a major developer of adult communities, and he is pleased with the national expansion of Standard Pacific and the solid earnings of Toll Brothers, a builder of luxury homes.

The top holdings of Alpine International Real Estate, which has assets of around $200 million, include JM, the Swedish commercial and residential developer; Gecina of France, which develops high-end office and apartment buildings in Paris, and the Midland Realty Group, a big real estate broker in Hong Kong.
The companies have had strong earnings or increases in their stock prices, according to Mr. Lieber.
But he isn't writing off REIT's, either.
In particular, he says he likes Vornado Realty Trust, which owns and manages commercial real estate and is one of the biggest landlords in New York City.
He also sees growth potential in some REIT's that are invested in hotels.

Mr. Cohen, too, says he thinks that many REIT's remain fundamentally strong.
Looking at the top holdings in Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, he said, "I like this list," which includes Boston Properties, AvalonBay Communities, Host Marriott and Vornado.
But Mr. Cohen's enthusiasm is tempered by what he calls economic "headwinds," namely the Federal Reserve's determination to keep inflation in check by raising interest rates.
Higher rates will hurt some REIT companies that borrow to finance their projects, he said, and tighter credit could also significantly cool off the economy.
"You need a strong economy to keep shopping malls going, to fill up office buildings," he said.
David Joy, capital markets strategist at American Express Financial Advisors, for one, says he thinks that the real estate sector's heady days may be behind it.

"The fact that interest rates are rising will make it difficult for real estate," he said.
In an appearance before the Senate Special Committee on Aging in March, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that absent a raise in payroll taxes, by the middle of this century Social Security benefits would amount to 30 percent of a typical worker's last wage -- down from 42 percent today.
To replace 80 percent of pre-retirement income, as financial advisers recommend, workers will therefore need much more in the piggy bank.
's, about enough for an annuity payment of $200 a month.
Some people do better than others, of course.
William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution argues that about a third of workers are on track, salting away enough for a comfortable retirement.
Yet another third have clearly not saved enough for a penury-free retirement.
The middle third, mostly younger workers, could go either way.
We know we are doing something wrong.

What's wrong with everyone?
Many people are simply befuddled by the arithmetic of retirement saving, clueless about how much they need to save.
But the complexity of the decision cannot alone explain such procrastination.
Indeed, new research suggests that we are just less rational than we have been led to believe.

The life-cycle theory of savings, a mainstay of standard economics, says that we act rationally to even out our consumption -- saving when we're young to consume when we're old -- coolly maximizing our economic well-being over our lifetimes.
But many people do not really behave that way.
In fact, we exhibit lots of foibles that make little sense.
For instance, we value the $100 that we may lose more highly than the $100 we may win, a concept that economists call loss aversion.
This helps explain why we can hate losses, though be willing to suffer opportunity costs -- that is, foregone future earnings -- even when the two are economically equal.

This eccentricity on its own could cut into our retirement savings, making us reluctant to lose income today in exchange for a future reward.
But our economic inconsistencies run deeper.
If given a choice today between doing 10 hours of awful work on May 1, or 12 hours on May 15, virtually everyone would prefer the 10 hours.
But come April 30, we pick the 12 hours, exhibiting an overweighting of immediate rewards and costs that scholars call hyperbolic discounting.
Last year, Mr. Laibson and his fellow economist George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon University, together with Jonathan D. Cohen and Samuel M. McClure of Princeton's Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior studied brain scans of people choosing between rewards at different points in time.
One is the lateral prefrontal cortex, a system that developed as humans began to split off from apes, which evaluates trade-offs between abstract rewards.
The other is the more primitive limbic system, designed to respond to immediate stimuli, which humans share with other mammals.
It suggests that this primitive brain structure, which developed to deal with immediate contingencies like a charging rhinoceros, tends to drive many of our decisions.
"It seems to drive a lot of indulgent behaviors," Mr. Laibson said.
Among them is the procrastinating, spend-now-don't-worry-about-tomorrow ethos that guides our approach to saving.
Understanding this psychological undertow is helping economists create new saving methods that take advantage of our behavioral quirks.

"The biggest driver of savings behavior is inertia," said Brian Tarbox, president of the Tarbox Group, a firm that helps fund providers devise pension plans.
"Inertia, engineered in the right way, can be used to the benefit of participants."

The required engineering is straightforward: it just requires flipping people's choices.
Rather than offering workers the opportunity to save, companies are automatically enrolling them in savings plans and offering them the chance to opt out.
The change was most drastic among lower-income workers, who need to increase their savings the most.
The 401(k) enrollment among newly hired workers earning $20,000 to $29,000 rose to 83 percent from 25 percent.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Automatic enrollment has drawbacks.
Procrastinating workers will stick to the default savings rate set by the company, even workers who would have saved more on their own.
They will also stay with the default asset allocation -- even when the company merely dumped the savings into a money-market fund offering very low returns.
"The key to defaults is that defaults are sticky," Ms. Madrian said.
"People are going to stick at the default."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
One alternative is to force people to make a choice.
Ms. Madrian, Mr. Laibson and Mr. Choi found that forcing workers to choose whether they want to join a 401(k) plan, instead of just giving them the option to do so, also increased participation rates radically.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Two economists, Richard H. Thaler of the University of Chicago and Shlomo Benartzi of the University of California, Los Angeles, have a different method, which they call Save More Tomorrow, or Smart.
The idea is to offer workers the option to start saving in the future and increase their contribution rate by a set amount every year, say, 1 or 2 percent of their wages, to a preset limit.
This device helps overcome hyperbolic discounting.
Just like the chunkier among us have an easier time signing up for a diet at a later time rather than starting one immediately, workers are more likely to agree to bite the savings bullet if it is deferred.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In one pilot tracked by the economists, workers' average contribution to their 401(k) plans rose from 3.5 percent of their wage before joining the Smart plan to 13.6 percent four years after signing up to the new method.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
These ideas are gaining traction in the financial industry.
The fund manager Vanguard, for instance, has about 180 corporate 401(k) plans on a new program that lets workers sign up for automatic annual contribution increases; it also has 50 plans on automatic enrollment and three companies that have chosen both.
One that is signing on to the full package is BHP Billiton, a mining company that is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia.
According to Dan Helman, who is responsible for retirement plans in the United States and Canada, BHP Billiton signed up first for automatic enrollment, then it started offering employees Vanguard's managed account option, under which Vanguard actively manages the asset allocation.
This month it should begin making the automatic annual increase available, too.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The results, so far, are encouraging.
"Now there are only two people out of more than 2,000 who are not on the 401(k)."
It is too soon to say whether this tinkering with our limbic system will truly make us close the savings gap.
For one, only half of all workers have a company savings plan.
Tinkering with 401(k) structures does nothing for the other half.
"How much of a solution this is will depend on how soon people take this up," Mr. Thaler said.
"If we reach people early enough this would be a pretty good solution."
But if this rejiggering of incentives proves insufficient, the new behavioral insights could spur a wave of interest in finding other solutions.
"I can see enormous interest in the pharmaceutical sector to design a neurochemical intervention mechanism to avoid temptation," Mr. Laibson said.

But did people believe the movie's message?
"At best, Blair and Brown resemble a couple posing for a happy-family photo opportunity after one of the spouses has been caught canoodling with a hooker by a Sunday tabloid," said a review by Joe Joseph in The Times of London.

There is some evidence that this feud fascinates the political elite more than many voters, but it has been woven into the Labor mythology that before the party came to office, Mr. Blair promised to hand over the prime ministership to Mr. Brown at some date.

The competition between them has some real consequences for who runs Britain.
The question is the margin of victory.
Some political analysts argue that the show of unity is intended to shield Mr. Blair against protest voting or abstentions by restive Labor supporters who want to weaken his position, returning him to power with a reduced majority and so accelerating a handoff to Mr. Brown.

Mr. Brown has proved more popular with voters in some opinion surveys than Mr. Blair, whose credibility has been badly damaged by the accusation that he led Britain into the war in Iraq on false premises.
But the idea of disaffected Laborites, particularly among the middle classes, voting against Mr. Blair for tactical reasons has infuriated some loyalists, including Peter Hain, a cabinet minister who argues that protest ballots could endanger the party's blue-collar supporters, like those in his constituency.

"There's now a kind of dinner party critic who quaffs shiraz or chardonnay and just sneeringly says, "You are no different from the Tories,"' Mr. Hain said in a newspaper interview last weekend.

George E. Pataki rejected the Legislature's bid to shine more light on two pots of money fed by hidden fees on utility bills: almost $1 billion that has been used to subsidize renewable energy projects and even pay for television advertisements featuring the governor.
Aides to the governor, environmentalists and advocates of "green" energy, like wind, solar, fuel-cell and hydroelectric power, say the two steady revenue streams lure investors and jobs to New York and should be kept free from legislative politics in Albany, where money is often sucked into pork-barrel projects or bottled up in annual arguments over appropriations.
But in a year defined by public outcry over Albany's secretive ways, lawmakers from both houses and both parties say legislative oversight would inject a needed level of public accountability into how the money from the utility fees is spent.
Others in Albany have noted how $300,000 of the funds helped pay for television ads.

"We feel very good about the outlook of the company and feel very bad about where the stock is trading," said Sallie Krawcheck, the chief financial officer.
Citigroup executives said the robust quarterly earnings were in large part a result of the double-digit revenue growth of its transaction services and consumer banking business in the United States and fast-growing markets in Asia, where its retail lending business has been booming.

Shares of Citigroup rose 35 cents, to $45.75.
The stock is down 2.4 percent so far this year.
Some investors are growing impatient with the poor performance of the asset management business, with profits down 25 percent from the same quarter last year.
While management is paying careful attention, she added, there were no plans to sell.
Some critics have said that the company has grown too large to manage.
Ms. Krawcheck said that was not the case: "With the proper controls in place, and the proper direction in place and the proper feedback mechanisms, we think the company is eminently manageable."
There are other challenges.
Citigroup executives said the increases stemmed from heavy investments in new retail branches and credit card advertising as well a $272 million "repositioning cost" of streamlining some of its back-office services.
Wachovia was expected to earn $1.01 from continuing operations, according to the average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
Being a cardinal "doesn't exempt you from basic psychological things happening," said Richard Moreland, a psychology professor at the University of Pittsburgh.
And one basic psychological thing that happens in groups is that some members accede to the desires of others.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"Conformity is a big thing," Dr. Moreland said.
There are two types: informational conformity, where one person believes others know best, and normative conformity, where fear of rejection or of loss of status is the driving force.
Some cardinals already have greater leadership roles; they travel and meet with other high church officials regularly.
So informational conformity may play a role.
Because well-connected cardinals may be perceived as having better access to information, they may hold sway over colleagues who work in relative isolation.
The influence may become apparent soon after the conclave starts.
"One thing we know about groups is that they do tend to form status hierarchies very quickly," said Dr. Philip Tetlock, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.
"People will pay close attention," he said.
"You might start to have coalitions in favor of certain candidates."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Coalition-forming will no doubt be spurred by the politicking that took place before the conclave.
In interviews with the news media and in homilies during the days surrounding the pope's funeral, some cardinals tried to make a case, subtly, for one of their peers.
Or for themselves.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But once the cardinals are inside, modern institutions like the media are forgotten.
The college of cardinals has been charged with electing the pope for almost 1,000 years, and the first secluded conclave was held more than 700 years ago.
The voting rules -- the winner must receive a majority of two-thirds plus one -- have existed with slight changes since 1179, although Pope John Paul II introduced a major change in 1996, requiring only a simple majority after a certain number of ballots.
Indeed, a conclave might be close to the ideal group, said James Surowiecki, author of "The Wisdom of Crowds," about decision-making and group dynamics.
"It's geographically and theologically diverse," he said.
"And diversity is very important for groups to make smart decisions."
Dr. Moreland said the secrecy, which extends to the voting -- cardinals are urged to disguise their handwriting when filling out ballots -- may also help the process.
"You get much less conformity when people can respond anonymously," he said.
"If nobody can tell you're defying the group, you have much less to fear."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Surowiecki said some members of the group may still "go along" with those of higher status, or those who are more talkative, or more confident.
But higher status and verbosity do not necessarily correlate with greater intelligence or insight.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"The real paradox of group intelligence is that groups are smartest when everyone is acting as much like an individual as possible," Mr. Surowiecki said.
In the past, that has not always been possible.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Other pressures of a more physical nature have also been brought to bear.
But there is no guarantee that the cardinals will make a good choice.
Jerry B. Harvey, an emeritus professor of business at George Washington University, knows how a bad choice could happen.
He has described what he calls the "Abilene paradox," when the pressure to conform based on fear makes people do things they don't want to do.
Dr. Harvey said he could imagine a situation in which the cardinals "would select somebody they'd all agree they didn't want."
It actually helps that the cardinals don't ordinarily spend a lot of time together.
"If you know one another and don't want to rock the boat with each other," he said, "you end up going to Abilene."
But unemployment statistics only count those who are actively looking for jobs.
Every other indicator shows a situation much less favorable to workers than that of the 1990's.
A lower fraction of the adult population is employed; the average duration of unemployment -- a rough indicator of how long it takes laid-off workers to find new jobs -- is much higher than it was in the 1990's.

Above all, the weak job market leaves workers with no bargaining power, so they aren't getting ahead: wage increases have been minimal, and haven't kept up with inflation.
Underlying these disappointing numbers is sluggish job creation.
Private-sector employment is still lower than it was before the 2001 recession.
Things could be, and have been, worse.
But those whose standard of living depends on wages, not capital gains -- in other words, the vast majority of Americans -- aren't feeling particularly prosperous.
By two to one, people tell pollsters that the economy is "only fair" or "poor," not "good" or "excellent."

Why, then, has the Fed been raising interest rates?
Because it is worried about inflation, which has risen to the top end of the 2 to 3 percent range the Fed prefers.

What's driving inflation?
Not wages: labor costs have been falling, because wages are growing less than productivity.
Oil prices are a big part of the story, but not all of it.
Other commodity prices are also rising; health care costs are once again on the march.
And a combination of capacity shortages, rising Asian demand and a weakening dollar has given industries like cement and steel new "pricing power."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
It all adds up to a mild case of stagflation: inflation is leading the Fed to tap on the brakes, even though this doesn't look or feel like a full-employment economy.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
We shouldn't overstate the case: we're not back to the economic misery of the 1970's.
But the fact that we're already experiencing mild stagflation means that there will be no good options if something else goes wrong.
Suppose, for example, that the consumer pullback visible in recent data turns out to be bigger than we now think, and growth stalls.
(Not that long ago many economists thought that an oil price in the 50's would cause a recession.)
Can the Fed stop raising interest rates and go back to rate cuts without causing the dollar to plunge and inflation to soar?
Or suppose that there's some kind of oil supply disruption -- or that warnings about declining production from Saudi oil fields turn out to be right.
Suppose that Asian central banks decide that they already have too many dollars.
Suppose that the housing bubble bursts.
Any of these events could easily turn our mild case of stagflation into something much more serious.

How do we get out of this bind?
As the old joke goes, I wouldn't start from here.
We should have spent the years of cheap oil encouraging conservation; we should have spent the years of modest growth in medical costs reforming our health care system.
Oh, and we'd have a wider range of policy options if the budget weren't so deeply in deficit.
So if any of these things does come to pass, we'll just have to see how well an administration in which political operatives make all economic policy decisions, and the Treasury secretary is only a salesman, handles crises.

Correction Appended
BECAUSE all three of the networks' early-evening newscasts, as good as they are, generally follow an hour or so of local news and are fed into households already saturated with news from CNN, Fox or MSNBC (which they didn't use to be), and because the adults the broadcasts are aimed at probably know all they want to know from the all-news radio station they listened to in the car coming home from work, and because their children are more interested in the Internet than they are in television and spend more time playing video games than watching videotape, the networks are thinking of ways to overhaul how they do news.
So, as someone who was privileged to be the executive producer of the first 30-minute network newscast in 1960, let me suggest that what's missing from network newscasts is opinion -- the kind of personalized, highly subjective material that people turn to the commentary page of their newspaper for after they've finished with the front page.
Why couldn't a newscast follow a newspaper's example and include commentary by bright, attractive articulate men and women of various political and ideological persuasions, with whom viewers -- like newspaper readers -- can agree, disagree, laugh at, sneer at or argue about when the newscast is over?
Jim Lehrer regularly includes a diversity of opinion in his "NewsHour" on PBS; CBS, NBC and ABC aren't reluctant to offer opinion in their Sunday talk shows, though they shy away from it on their newscasts.
Sure, traditions like the one CBS's Walter Cronkite and NBC's Chet Huntley and David Brinkley pioneered more than 40 years ago die hard but they do sometimes die.
To keep them going, the broadcasts need something new.
Now, if the networks are looking for ways to re-energize their news, the formula may be as simple as taking a page from the "60 Minutes" book and offering some audacious commentary.

And Derek McLane's rendering of the home shared by two second-tier casting agents, Eddie (Mr. Hawke) and Mickey (Mr. Hamilton), has a slovenly, airless claustrophobia.
It is a hangout for friends who want to get stoned, get sloshed, get laid.
They include Phil (Bobby Cannavale), a bit actor of thuggish good looks and combustible temperament, and Artie, a leering, avuncular scriptwriter (Wallace Shawn, cast against type in a role created by Jerry Stiller).
Then there are the women, who are passed around as if they were bongs: Darlene (Ms. Posey), a jittery, chic photographer; Donna (Halley Wegryn Gross), a 15-year-old drifter; and Bonnie (Catherine Kellner), a stripper famous for balloon dancing.
They are all surprisingly long-winded, and while they are always advising one another on how to improve their lives, the only people they are on intimate terms with are their own individual selves.
It is appropriate that when Phil talks about looking at his estranged wife, he remembers seeing a hostile cloud of fog where her face should be.
These jerks are drawn, by performers and playwright, with such fine-grained artistry and accuracy that they are compulsively watchable, giving the lie to the theory that you have to like characters to be engaged by them.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday and Thursday, he and his economic minister, Rafael Correa, criticized his predecessor's fiscal austerity measures and ties to international lending institutions.
Mr. Palacio and his ministers have criticized the government's fiscal responsibility law and have said they would like to use oil money earmarked for the public debt to pay for social spending.
Mr. Palacio, who does not belong to a political party, also stressed his independence.
"I'm a simple doctor."
Mr. Palacio, though, faces a host of obstacles in a chronically unstable country that has a bitterly divided Congress, a citizenry fed up with corrupt and inept politicians and, for the moment, no functioning Supreme Court.
The new government has yet to obtain international recognition, though political analysts expect it.

Ecuadorean lawmakers based their vote on Wednesday on a clause in the Constitution permitting the removal of a president for "abandonment" of his post.
Mr. Palacio, a former health minister from coastal Guayaquil, Ecuador's economic engine, is virtually unknown in the country.
For many Ecuadoreans and politicians here, the big question is whether Mr. Palacio can unite a divided country behind his government while forming political pacts with Ecuador's myriad parties.
Mr. Palacio's pledge to call a referendum in the next few months, the first step toward a reform of the Constitution, will win him some supporters.
But the new president's steps have already ruffled some feathers, like the appointment of Mr. Correa as economic and finance minister.
Mr. Correa, an economist, has criticized Ecuador's trade pacts, its deals with the International Monetary Fund and its decision to replace its legal tender with the dollar.
While the United States does consume more oil today, most of it is for transportation.
And even as gasoline prices hover at record levels, the cost, adjusted for inflation, is still well below the peak reached in the early 1980's.
Even more important, fuel takes up a smaller share of Americans' income.

This is not to say that the higher gasoline prices are not starting to pinch -- or that they will not send the economy for a loop if they go up sharply from these levels.
With retail prices expected to reach a nationwide average of $2.35 a gallon this summer as travelers crowd the highways for vacations, the high costs could become more of a burden.
Higher fuel prices have started to hurt slightly by curbing spending elsewhere.
The core rate, which excludes food and energy, had its biggest monthly increase in nearly four years.

Today, thanks to energy-saving measures set off by the oil shocks of the 1970's and 1980's, most of these numbers have been cut in half, according to David Wyss, the chief economist at Standard & Poor's.
Households now spend about 5 percent of their income on their energy bills.
It takes 42 minutes of work to pay for a 100-mile trip, and energy costs account for 7 percent of the American economy.

It also takes 55 percent less oil and gas to produce the same amount of gross domestic product today, compared with 1973 even as Americans' income, on average, has doubled.
"Americans seem to be able to bull their way through everything," Mr. Wyss said.
"No matter how high oil prices go, Americans will always find something to spend their money on," Mr. Wyss said.
Still, every penny's increase in petroleum prices adds $3 billion a year in costs for consumers, which translates into a larger trade deficit, higher costs for some goods and lower real income, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
For gasoline alone, every penny increase means more than $1.4 billion in higher costs.

"That is money that will not be spent on other goods and services," said John Felmy, the institute's chief economist.
Some economists argue that since the increase has happened over a longer period of time -- unlike previous oil shocks, when prices spiked in a matter of weeks -- the economy has been able to absorb it without spinning into a recession.

"The increase has proceeded at a relatively gradual pace," said James D. Hamilton, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, "a pace at which the economy has had time to adapt; a pace that hasn't panicked consumers or firms; a pace different from earlier periods when increases came much more suddenly."

High energy costs have also had a lesser effect because they have not led to a widespread inflationary spiral that caused the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates sharply, according to Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard, who was the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2003.
"These days, long-term inflation expectations are much better anchored than they used to be 10 or 15 years ago.
When people see a spike in oil prices, they don't immediately infer that we'll see double-digit inflation."

So how high must prices go before consumers feel the effects and the economy starts hurting?
"I don't know that there is a cliff to walk off from," Mr. Wyss of Standard & Poor's said.
"It's more like a slippery slope.
It would probably take a doubling of oil prices to get us to the same situation as 1981."
(In any case, taking inflation into account, prices would have to reach $80 a barrel to match the record of March 1981.
Using a similar measure, gasoline would have to rise to $3.12 a gallon to match its 1981 peak.)

Many economists say there is typically a lag before the full effects of an oil shock are felt.
Stephen Brown, the director of energy economics for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, estimates that higher energy costs could cut growth from 2004 through 2006 as much as 1.6 percentage points below where it otherwise might have been.

"We're not that far down the road yet," Mr. Brown said.
"Some of the impact on the economy is yet to come."
So far, Mr. Brown said, businesses have been reluctant to pass higher fuel costs on to consumers.

According to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll released April 4, respondents ranked high gas prices below terrorism and health care costs as priorities for the president and Congress.
The same poll suggested that about 50 percent of Americans have cut back significantly on the amount of driving they do; more than a third of the respondents said they had reduced their spending significantly because of the higher prices.

Returning from her honeymoon last April to ever-rising gasoline prices, Mrs. Orio decided to leave her brand-new silver Subaru Outback at home and ride the bus to work.
She moved her two young boys to a public school closer to home in January so they would not have to ride 38 miles to their private school in the family's supersize Ford 150 pickup truck.
A year later, Mrs. Orio has grown used to her new routine, which saves her about $368 a month in gasoline costs and another $125 in parking fees.
"I will never take my car again," Mrs. Orio said in a telephone interview.

Trips123 is a creation of Transcom, an entity the Port Authority created in the mid-1980's to coordinate the timing and location of highway construction projects in the hope of easing congestion.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Transcom, which became an independent nonprofit organization in 2000, specializes in "intelligent transportation systems": the use of computers, telecommunications and broadcast signals to move vehicles and people more efficiently.
Trips123, which to date has cost about $20 million, was formally established April 6, though it has operated since October.
The site, which is still being developed, covers 14 counties in New Jersey, 12 in New York and 3 in Connecticut.
It has two free features.
One is a traveler information center fed by constant updates from highway and transit agencies.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Users can zoom in on maps of any part of the region.
Congestion is denoted by color: green for normal, yellow for moderate, orange for heavy.
A red road means drivers should expect delays.
Icons warn motorists of possible trouble: a red X for a traffic incident, a yellow triangle for a construction site and a purple star for sports or a special event.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The other free feature, TransitAdvisor, allows users to plan trips using a combination of subways, buses, commuter railroads and ferries.
The program suggests the quickest way to get between two points, using an algorithm that takes into account transit schedules and walking times.

Eventually, the site will offer a subscription-based feature.
For $5.95 a month, commuters will be notified about delays or disruptions in their normal daily routes.
The customized notices will be sent by telephone, cellphone, pager, fax or e-mail message.
But Joseph M. Sussman, a leading proponent of the integration of technology and transportation, questioned whether money could made off the Web site, as its creators hope.
"The market really hasn't established that people are willing to pony up their own personal resources for these services, even modest amounts," said Dr. Sussman, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Officials at Transcom, which is an abbreviation for the Transportation Operations Coordinating Committee, acknowledged that the Web site had taken far longer to develop than anyone had imagined and that the potential for raising money remained to be seen.

"This is a 16-agency cooperative effort," said Matthew L. Edelman, the executive director.
"We have no authority, and this coalition works because we have no authority.
Things need to be approved cooperatively and implemented cooperatively."
The history of the project, however, shows that bad luck may have had as much to do with the delay as any lack of cooperation.

Meanwhile, Transcom could not even settle on a name for the site.

Even as Transcom struggled with the project, a similar site was being formed.

While Hopstop seems more user-friendly than Trips123, it is far more limited in scope.

It is difficult to tell which site is doing better.
On Thursday, Trips123 recorded 88,000 page views and 125,000 hits, according to Mr. Bamford.
They noted that only their site directly received information from transit agencies like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, although most of the authority's schedules and routes are available on its own site, at mta.info.

Mr. Edelman, who oversees a $4 million budget and nearly 35 employees, conceded that getting the site up had been a long and difficult process.
Transcom's annual March meeting, where agencies gather to compare their construction calendars, has become a tradition.
Inside the organization's 24-hour control center, which overlooks the Hudson River, workers are constantly gathering information about traffic and transit conditions.
They send information about highway incidents to all affected agencies, from the state police to various turnpike and thruway authorities.

The organization maintains eight servers and 50 workstations, many of which are housed with the member agencies, which use the computers to enter data.
Transcom also uses video networking, highway message signs, radio signals and special readers that use a car's E-ZPass, the toll-payment device, to detect its speed.
The need for information and coordination has never been greater, he said.

Underlying the doubts about the exchange's merger with Archipelago is the notion that Goldman, in brokering the deal, magnified, unjustly, its influence as the most influential investment bank on Wall Street.
Goldman Sachs's 15 percent stake in Archipelago makes it the largest shareholder among Wall Street banks and the fact that Mr. Thain, a former president of Goldman, approached his former employer to advise on the deal has raised questions from competitors.
While Goldman may have reaped $7 million from the deal, a pittance by Wall Street standards, in the eyes of its clients it still burnished an image that it is the ultimate deal maker on Wall Street.
In the cutthroat world of Wall Street, the perception of being such an insider can result in extra deals and fees.

There is also a regulatory hurdle to clear: the Archipelago deal has received initial approval from regulators and a competing bid would have to pass the same rigorous muster.
"The firms want to understand the value proposed and if there is a case that this deal is undervalued," said Mr. Mack, who is also serving as the group's spokesman.

In the deal, which was valued at $4.3 billion, shareholders of Archipelago are to receive 30 percent of the combined company, a figure that has angered some seat holders and fed their suspicions over Goldman's role, given its 15 percent stake in Archipelago.

Now that the dust has settled from the technology boom and busts, he said, "they can focus on how to best apply and implement these technologies to their business needs."
Several factors are promoting the trend, Mr. Gilroy said.
According to the survey, small-business owners spend an average of 27 percent of their time outside the office.
That leads them to buy equipment like laptops and BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices that give them the freedom to roam.
In addition, Mr. Gilroy said, small-business owners are more comfortable with technology today.

On the 91 Express, the prices vary from hour to hour in a system where traffic is constantly monitored and costs are adjusted accordingly.
The car pool lanes, which are still free, are enforced by state patrol cars.
But critics say it sets up a class system for motorists.
Or that it amounts to a double charge, since state and federal gas taxes were levied to pay for road construction in the first place.

The tolls have also succeeded in doing what no amount of cajoling and public service announcements could do: get people to car-pool.
The 91 now has the highest occupancy per vehicle of any major road in California, state officials said.
The reason is that toll lanes here are still free for people who car-pool, offering an incentive to travel together -- a savings in tolls of more than $50 a week.
The new tolls rely on radio technology to debit an account instantly, and they are priced to ensure maximum flow of traffic and pay for the road but still make it worthwhile for a driver to leave the free road.

The buyout cost $207 million.
Another toll road in this region, the 73 in Orange County, is facing a potential default on its bonds because it is not meeting traffic or revenue projections.
Commuters say they shun it because it does not save much time compared with nearby free roads.

Some highway user groups are concerned that the toll roads will be used simply as a way to raise taxes, without any guarantee that the money will go into roads.
These groups and their allies in Congress tried, unsuccessfully, to have a provision inserted into the House version of the transportation bill now moving through Congress that would allow charging for only new lanes -- not converting free lanes into pay lanes.
Minnesota will do just that next month on Interstate 394, converting car pool lanes into paid express lanes on a road that carries commuters to and from the suburbs west of Minneapolis.
The fee will vary according to traffic and car pools will still be free.
State officials are promoting the system as the wave of the future -- an on-time auto commute, for a price.
Correction: May 5, 2005, Thursday A chart last Thursday with an article about a trend toward toll roads to ease congestion included one carpool system erroneously among those that allow single-occupancy vehicles for a fee.
The QuickRide program on Interstate 10 in Houston is for two-occupant vehicles that use the carpool lane for a fee during peak times when the rules require at least three occupants.
It does not permit single-occupant vehicles.

An analysis of the video to determine the size and manner of flying of the bird, as well as the other sightings and the detailed reports of experts like Mr. Gallagher, proved convincing.
The birds live about 15 years, so some breeding population had to have survived for some time.
Frank Gill, former president of the National Audubon Society, said of the news, "You get so depressed by the state of things, to suddenly have this happen in your backyard" is wonderful, "just the thought that there are places in the world still -- deep wilderness -- harboring a secret like this."

One particularly bright spot, Dr. Fitzpatrick said, is that the place where the bird was seen is already protected.
The bayou where the bird was sighted is in thick swamp where even a great blue heron taking off not 20 yards away disappeared immediately.

On a paddle through the bayou led by researchers from the Cornell Lab and a representative of the Nature Conservancy, the flat, clay-colored water was broken only by the splashing of turtles and the rapid-fire paddling of a frightened wood duck chick.
As Dr. Fitzpatrick put it, the woodpecker is doing a good job of "protecting itself."
He added, "It is really scarce and really wary."

Now the effort to protect the bird will continue, as will the search for other individuals.
But for now, he said, "we would like people to give us a little bit of time."
As for the woodpeckers, there is only proof of one bird so far.
If there are more, then perhaps, Dr. Gill said, "we can put Humpty Dumpty back together again."

Nobody wants to think about the alternative.
If the last living ivory bill has been found, the discovery may be more bitter than sweet.
But no other major oil exporter has tried to reel in its own fuel consumption with as much zeal as Norway.
These policies have resulted in Norwegians consuming much less oil per capita than Americans -- 1.9 gallons a day versus almost 3 gallons a day in the United States-- and low car ownership rates.
On city streets and rural roads, fuel-efficient Volkswagens and Peugeots far outnumber big sport utility vehicles.

[Norway's gasoline policies stand in contrast to those in the United States, where President Bush made cheaper gasoline a priority during his discussion of energy policy at his news conference on Thursday.]
Gasoline, of course, is not the only expensive commodity in Norway, a traditionally frugal and highly taxed nation.
At a pub in Oslo, for instance, a pint of beer might cost the equivalent of $12 and an individual frozen pizza $16.
But expensive gasoline is rare among large oil-producing countries that often subsidize fuel for their citizens.
Gasoline prices in Norway -- with a currency, the krone, strong in comparison with the dollar -- have climbed 30 percent since 1998, outpacing a 15 percent increase in the consumer price index in that period, the national statistics bureau said.
Having the world's highest gasoline prices is just one strategy to combat greenhouse gases in this redoubt of welfare capitalism and strict environmental laws.
Overall energy consumption, especially of electricity, is quite high, however, with Norway blessed with not just oil but ample hydropower resources.

Norway not only taxes its gasoline.
Norwegians also pay automobile taxes as high as $395 a year for each vehicle, and in Oslo there is even a "studded-tire" fee of about $160 for vehicles with all-terrain tires that tear up asphalt more quickly in the winter.

Then there are the taxes on new passenger vehicles that can increase the price of imported automobiles.
Norway has no auto manufacturing industry aside from an experiment to produce electric cars, and economists have suggested that that has made it easier to limit automobile use in Norway because there is no domestic industry to lobby against such decisions as in neighboring Sweden, home of Saab and Volvo.

Norway designed the duties to make large-engine sport utility vehicles much costlier than compact cars.
For instance, a high-end Toyota Land Cruiser that costs $60,000 in the United States might run as much as $100,000 in Norway.
Economists argue that gasoline prices and other auto taxes in Norway are not so expensive when measured against the annual incomes of Norwegians, among the world's highest at about $51,700 a person, or the shorter workweek of about 37.5 hours that is the norm here.
(Norwegians also get five weeks of vacation a year.)
The government frequently makes such arguments when responding to criticism over high fuel prices.
"We do not want such a system," Per-Kristian Foss, the finance minister, said in a curt response to the calls for lower gasoline taxes this month in Parliament.

Other European countries have also placed high taxes on gasoline, and some like Britain and the Netherlands have gasoline prices that rival or at times surpass Norway's.
In Oslo, as in other European capitals, there is ample public transportation, including an express airport train that whisks travelers to the international airport from downtown in 20 minutes.
Yet Norway, with a population of just 4.6 million, differs from much of Europe in its breadth, with an extensive network of roads, tunnels and bridges spread over an area slightly larger than New Mexico.

"Rural areas without good public transportation alternatives are hit a little harder," said Knut Sandberg Eriksen, a senior research economist at the Institute of Transport Economics here who estimates the government collects about $2.4 billion in fuel taxes alone each year, or about $519 for every Norwegian.
Some of the revenue supports Norway's social benefits.

"Our government has been grateful to use the automobile as a supreme tax object," Mr. Eriksen said.
"The car is its milking cow."
Perhaps as a result of such policies, Norway has lower levels of car ownership than other European countries, with 427 cars per 1,000 people in 2003 compared with more than 500 cars per 1,000 people in both France and Germany, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.
The United States has more than 700 cars per 1,000 people.

The average age of a passenger car in Norway is 18 years when it is scrapped, though this might be changing in a strong economy with the lowest interest rates in 50 years.
But the frugality of some Norwegians, even in rural areas, suggests older cars will remain at many households.
"Personally I have no need for a new vehicle; I'm proud to hold on to my own for as long as I can," said Johannes Rode, 69, a retired art and music teacher and owner of a 29-year-old red Volkswagen Beetle in Ramberg, a coastal town in northern Norway.
"To do otherwise would be wasteful and play into the oil industry's hands."

Caution about oil's risks is common in Norway.
The government created the Petroleum Fund more than a decade ago as a repository for most of the royalties it receives from oil production.
The $165 billion fund, overseen by the central bank, is intended for the day when oil resources in the North Sea start to dry up.
Meanwhile, unlike other large oil producers like Saudi Arabia, Iran or Venezuela, Norway has done little to encourage domestic petroleum consumption.
In part because high gasoline prices deter such a luxury, Norway consumes little more than 200,000 barrels a day of oil while exporting nearly its entire production of 3.3 million barrels a day.
This confounds some Norwegians.

"Norway is a rich, oil-producing country with no foreign debt," said Egil Otter, a spokesman for the Norwegian Automobile Association, a sister organization to AAA.
"We think that Norway, with its enormous and complicated geography and distances, deserves pump prices at an average European level.
Motorists find it very difficult to be taxed into these extremes."

Such opinions contrast with the quick defense of high gasoline prices often voiced around Norway, which is celebrating its 100th year of independence from neighboring Sweden and so far has opted out of joining the European Union.

"We are engaged on this front," Mr. Lodgaard said.
"It is difficult for us to view the example of the United States, which is overconsuming to an incredible extent."

The United States, which uses about a quarter of the world's daily oil consumption, had the cheapest gasoline prices of the 27 industrial countries measured by the International Energy Agency in its most recent analysis of fuel prices.
Even amid Norway's bluster on gasoline prices, however, environmentalists suggest the nation could do more to achieve greater energy efficiency.
One sore point is the consumption of electricity, traditionally generated by hydropower but soon to depend more on a fossil fuel, natural gas.
Producing oil for export in Norway requires large amounts of electricity, and homes in the country, with much of its territory above the Arctic Circle, use electricity for heating, creating much higher electricity consumption levels than elsewhere in Europe.

But who can tell what the limit is for the federal government?
Most experts have been content to answer the question this way: At some point, lenders will stop lending, and that's when we know we've hit the limit.

Not very satisfying, is it?
Of course, it's not as if someone can call the bank to check.
But with a few simple tools, one can establish a rough sense of where American borrowing stands and how much headroom is left.
Here's a way to approach the question:
Because the federal government borrows in the global credit market, it's not possible to check with all the participants to learn their limits.
But the ability of any borrower to get credit depends on its ability to repay the money.
So by looking at other countries that have stumbled into financial trouble, one can draw a few reasonable conclusions.
One astounding example of national debt was that of Britain after World War II, when it owed debts representing about 250 percent of its gross domestic product.
It's worth noting that Britain later paid down the debts to a level near 50 percent of G.D.P.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
According to Moritz Kraemer, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's in London and an expert on sovereign debt, it's not easy to exceed debt burdens of around 150 percent of gross domestic product.
"There are not many countries that can sustain debt at that level for any length of time," he has found.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Of course, as the leading economy in the world, the United States has certain advantages over a smaller country in handling its debt burdens.
And as Britain's experience shows, it is possible for debts to exceed temporarily the level of 150 percent of G.D.P.
But at high debt levels, the risk of a lending crisis, perhaps prompted by recession or rising interest rates, becomes significant.
And any Argentine will tell you that a lending crisis is worth avoiding.

So assume that debt of 150 percent of G.D.P.
is a sound limit for borrowing by the United States.
It could probably borrow more, but that doesn't seem prudent, given the experience of other countries.
Based on America's G.D.P.
today, that translates to an $18 trillion debt ceiling.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
HOW close is the nation to that limit?
It depends on what you count as debt.
The most simplistic view counts only what the Treasury calls "debt held by the public."
That amount is $4.6 trillion, about a quarter of our prudent limit.
That doesn't sound too bad.
Unfortunately, it's not the whole story.
The government counts an additional $3.2 trillion owed by some government agencies to others.
It's tempting to ignore this.
After all, so what if Uncle Sam owes himself money?
But about $2 trillion of that amount represents the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
It's a good bet that the workers who have paid in those dollars expect to be repaid in full, with interest.
If you count those trust funds as legitimate debts, you get to a current debt of $6.6 trillion.
But that's not all.
President Bush has been telling us about the looming crisis in Social Security.
The problem is that the trust fund, large as it is, isn't big enough to cover the expected obligations ahead.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
According to government figures, to make the Social Security trust fund big enough to cover its obligations, we'd have to pay in an additional $4 trillion or so today.
And that's only for the next 75 years.
To put Social Security on a sound basis indefinitely, significantly larger sums are needed.
One can quibble about whether this amount is, strictly speaking, a debt, but it is certainly an obligation under current law.
To reflect that, add the $4 trillion -- and our current debt stands at $10.6 trillion.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Which brings us to Medicare, by far the largest of our future obligations.
Because nearly everyone expects health care costs to keep rising faster than economic growth, the trustees of the Medicare fund warn that the nation faces an enormous shortfall.
They report that the country would have to pay in $9 trillion today to make the trust fund big enough to cover its future obligations, and set aside an additional $21 trillion to cover supplementary obligations -- for example, the prescription drug benefit -- that lie outside the scope of the trust fund.
Again, these are traditional 75-year figures; the amounts needed to put things on a sound basis indefinitely are even larger.
Add up all the figures, including those for Medicare, and the aggregate debt is $40.6 trillion in present dollars, well over that prudent limit of $18 trillion.
What is the upshot of all this debt?
A look at the entire picture shows clearly that additional borrowing doesn't seem prudent.
And while exceeding the nation's limits doesn't guarantee a credit crisis, it certainly highlights the risk.
The result, those involved say, should be to increase significantly the number of prosecutions brought against dangerous employers, particularly in cases involving death or injury.

This new approach addresses a chronic weakness in the regulatory system -- the failure of federal agencies to take a coordinated approach toward corporations that repeatedly violate the same safety and environmental regulations.
The E.P.A.
and OSHA in particular have a history of behaving like estranged relatives.
Yet the central premise of this unfolding strategy is that shoddy workplace safety often goes hand in hand with shoddy environmental practices.
"If you don't care about protecting your workers, it probably stands to reason that you don't care about protecting the environment either," said David M. Uhlmann, chief of the Justice Department's environmental crimes section, which is charged with bringing these new prosecutions.
The effort is noteworthy in an administration that has generally resisted efforts to increase penalties for safety and environmental violations.
It has declined to support such steps as making it a felony for employers to commit willful safety violations that cause a worker's death.
Such violations are currently misdemeanors, punishable by up to six months in jail.
Instead, the administration has emphasized a more collaborative approach, offering companies increased technical assistance, for instance, on how to comply with regulations.

The new initiative is already at an advanced stage of planning.
Hundreds of senior OSHA compliance officers have attended training sessions led by Justice Department prosecutors and criminal investigators from the E.P.A.
In several regions of the country, OSHA managers have begun making lists of the worst workplaces and sharing them with E.P.A.
investigators and prosecutors, who select the most promising cases for investigation.
Several criminal inquiries and prosecutions are under way.

In March, for example, Motiva Enterprises, an oil refining company partly owned by Shell Oil, pleaded guilty to endangering workers negligently and committing environmental crimes in Delaware.

Even so, it is difficult to gauge the degree of political support for more prosecutions.
His successor, Alberto R. Gonzales, has been briefed on the initiative and is said to be supportive.
What was to have been called the Worker Endangerment Initiative is now described as a "policy decision" -- not an "initiative" -- aimed at achieving "environmental protection in the workplace."
Neither Jonathan L. Snare, the acting OSHA administrator, nor Howard Radzely, the Labor Department's top lawyer, would agree to be interviewed about it.
But Richard E. Fairfax, OSHA's director of enforcement programs, described the initiative as part of a broader effort by the agency to crack down on companies that persistently flout workplace safety rules.

"This is important to the agency," he said.
If some hesitation exists at the political level, enthusiasm is high in the trenches of OSHA and the E.P.A.
Andrew D. Goldsmith, assistant chief of the environmental crimes section, has led most of the OSHA training sessions, in which he describes the many ways criminal and environmental statutes can be brought to bear.
It has been a revelation of sorts, he says, to watch agency compliance officers grasp the chance at last to seek significant criminal penalties against defiant employers.

"You see a glint in these people's eyes, and you see them getting very enthusiastic," Mr. Goldsmith said.
"You see hands start shooting up.
They view us like the cavalry coming over the hill."

If sustained, the enthusiasm would represent an important cultural shift inside OSHA, which has traditionally shied away from referring even the most deliberate of safety violations to prosecutors.
But as the series also demonstrated, OSHA's reluctance to seek prosecution had also been fed by an assumption inside the agency that federal prosecutors have little interest in cases that have rarely resulted in prison sentences.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
By fusing the technical skills and regulatory powers of the E.P.A.
and OSHA with the Justice Department's environmental crimes section, the administration has created a potentially potent means of changing that dynamic.
All federal environmental crimes carry potential prison sentences, including up to 15 years for knowingly endangering workers.
And unlike OSHA, the E.P.A.
has some 200 criminal investigators with extensive experience building cases for federal prosecutors.
In 2001 alone, the agency obtained prison sentences totaling 256 years.

OSHA, meanwhile, has wide jurisdiction over American workplaces, and its inspectors routinely wander the floors of the nation's dirtiest and most dangerous manufacturing operations.
Unlike E.P.A.
inspectors, they also investigate hundreds of workplace deaths and injuries each year.
In short, they are well positioned to spot potential environmental crimes, particularly those that harm workers.
With nearly 40 prosecutors, the environmental crimes section of the Justice Department has a long record of bringing complex criminal cases against major employers.
Now, after identifying promising cases from the lists sent by OSHA, prosecutors are also checking for significant records of environmental infractions.
If a plant is part of a larger conglomerate, they are checking the records of sister plants, too.

"We can see all the pieces," Mr. Goldsmith said.

Senior officials at OSHA, the E.P.A.
and the Justice Department saw a way to produce an indictment that would "tell the whole picture" of how a company could put profit ahead of all other considerations, said Mr. Uhlmann, the chief of the environmental crimes section.
In December 2003, several senior managers at the New Jersey foundry were indicted on charges of conspiring to violate safety and environmental laws and repeatedly obstructing government inquiries by lying and altering accident scenes.
The case is pending, but Justice Department officials called it a "pioneering indictment."

On Halloween 2001, the United States Treasury said it would no longer issue a 30-year bond.
"We do not need the 30-year bond to meet the government's current financing needs, nor those we expect to face in coming years," said the administration official who announced its demise.
Oh, for the good old days.
Since 2002, annual deficits have added nearly $1 trillion to the nation's debt, bringing it to $4.3 trillion last year, nearly double what budget experts were projecting back in 2001.
Yet the Treasury says that the nation's ballooning indebtedness is not a factor in its recent decision to consider reissuing the 30-year bond.
Not a factor?
In the real world, reviving the 30-year bond would mean acknowledging that the nation's growing debt burden will eventually cause long-term interest rates to rise.
Right now, however, those rates are abnormally low.
So reverting to the 30-year bond would lock in low rates on future government borrowing.
That would be a good thing for taxpayers, whose taxes go to pay the bonds' interest.
But coming out and saying so would expose one of the administration's biggest failings: it has created the conditions for higher interest rates by squandering the Clinton-era surpluses and piling on debt.
Locking in low rates with a 30-year bond is clever, but it is no substitute for cutting the deficit and reducing the national debt, something the powers-that-be have no credible plan for doing.
A move to bring back the bond also flags the danger of America's immense borrowing from abroad.
Without a 30-year bond, the average maturity of the debt held by foreigners has been falling -- to 54 months this year from 60 months in 2003.
Such short maturities -- together with a depreciating dollar -- make financial markets fearful that in the near term, foreign lenders may choose to invest in other currencies' assets when their dollar-based debt matures, forcing the United States to raise rates, perhaps sharply, to attract the loans it needs.
The 30-year bond would alleviate some of that anxiety.
But again, it's no substitute for curbing the borrowing itself.
There is nothing objectionable, per se, about the 30-year bond.
But if the nation were on a path to paying off its debt and accumulating assets for the future, as it was in the years before the Bush binge, there would be little need for it now.

ASSASSINATION VACATION By Sarah Vowell.
258 pp.
Simon & Schuster.
$21.
Terri Schiavo has just received a morphine suppository!
The Pope is being fed through his nose!
I don't mean to sound lofty or scornful; I was glued to the tube, too.
Then I read Sarah Vowell's "Assassination Vacation," a learned, engagingly discursive, funny, sometimes even jolly ramble -- literally -- through the landscape of American presidential assassinations.
To what evidentiary purpose Garfield's spine ended up in jurors' hands, Vowell does not say -- even in death, most politicians would be mortified to have their backbones examined -- but the incident does serve as proof that when it comes to ghoulishness, you'll rarely outdo the 19th century, and this despite its lack of 24-hour cable news networks and their attendant programming needs.
"Assassination Vacation" revels in such small epiphanies.
Having made the commercially courageous decision to avoid the catnip that is the Kennedy name, Vowell restricts her gaze to America's first three presidential murders: those of Abraham Lincoln, Garfield and William McKinley.
Mixing travelogue, history, personal essay and social criticism, she follows the loose formula perfected in two previous collections of magazine pieces and adapted versions of her appearances on public radio's "This American Life," where she is a regular.
(She has entertained an even larger audience as the voice of Violet, the sulky teenage daughter in "The Incredibles.")
Here, displaying heroic obsessiveness, she dedicates herself to visiting virtually every historical site associated with the three assassinations no matter how tangential, roaming as far afield as the Dry Tortugas, 70 miles off Key West, where four of the conspirators in Lincoln's shooting were locked up.
And then it's off to Mount Marcy in the Adirondacks, which is where, in 1901, Vice President Theodore Roosevelt had been enjoying a "bully good tramp" through the woods when he learned that McKinley, gut-shot by a gloomy anarchist, was near death and that he, Roosevelt, would soon be president.
Never at a loss for a bus ticket or a friend willing to drive her to a weed-choked cemetery, Vowell shows herself to be a connoisseur of half-hidden historical plaques, recreated sitting rooms and docents in hoop skirts.
She suffers for her quest.
"Going to Ford's Theater to watch the play," she notes, "is like going to Hooters for the food."

In a recent research report, Michael Hecht, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, noted that the management of E*Trade "believes that the discount brokerage industry is ripe for consolidation and hopes to participate."
Consolidation among the online brokerage firms, now seen by executives as a necessary step in a struggle for survival, is expected to reach down to investors and the prices they pay to trade stocks.

Online brokerage firms offer deals now for investors to pay as little as $8.95 a trade and some offer 20 or more commission-free trades as an incentive to sign up with the services.

Speculation of a deal between E*Trade and Ameritrade took hold Friday after E*Trade canceled meetings with investors in Europe and scaled back a stock buyback program, according to Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners who follows both companies.

Though he downplayed the possibility of a quick deal, Mr. Repetto said, "Consolidation makes a lot of sense."
Ameritrade's shares, which are down more than 20 percent so far this year, rose 57 cents Friday, to $11.31, while E*Trade, whose stock is also down more than 20 percent, rose 93 cents, to $11.93.

Of the two companies, E*Trade has been somewhat buffered from the slump in stock trading because it has a bank that sells mortgages among other products -- although that business, too, could suffer as interest rates rise.
A merger between E*Trade and Ameritrade would place more pressure on Charles Schwab.
The company, long an industry giant, has shaken up its management and cut commissions several times over the last few months in an effort to regain ground lost in recent years to smaller, more nimble competitors like E*Trade and Ameritrade.

The step is a normal part of the process of enriching uranium for use as fuel for nuclear power reactors, but since the West has seized on several pieces of evidence and concluded that Iran has ambitions to become a nuclear arms power, there is a consensus that it wants to proceed to the high level of enrichment necessary to produce weapons-grade material.

Iran confirmed earlier in the week that it had converted 37 tons of uranium ore concentrate into uranium tetrafluoride, and Western experts say it may take only a few weeks to convert that material into uranium hexafluoride, which can then be fed into centrifuges for enrichment.
European diplomats, asking not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of their negotiations with Iran, said the International Atomic Energy Agency might need to act quickly if Iran resumed the conversion, to cut off a process that could be carried out quickly.
A further fear, they said, would be that Iran might proceed with the conversion and then suspend its activities once again, before the international agency acted, effectively going one step further down the road before action could be taken against it.

Whether to call for an immediate session of the atomic energy agency "is for the Europeans, first and foremost, to determine," Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said Wednesday.

The tough decisions needed on both spending and revenues will probably require some process whereby the president and leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives and both parties assume joint responsibility for painful political choices.
Tax revenues are approximately 16.5 percent of gross domestic product, the lowest level since 1960, and spending is roughly 20 percent.
We must have serious spending discipline and entitlement reform -- though any entitlement reforms likely to be proposed would have little immediate effect.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But, as BusinessWeek, not an advocate of activist government, said in a recent editorial, "the deficit morass is due as much to a revenue shortfall as to excessive spending."
(The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, for example, are estimated to have a 75-year cost of $11 trillion, almost three times the entire Social Security deficit.)
And that shortfall is especially pressing given the rapid increases in entitlement costs and the need to finance national security, investments in education and infrastructure and other critical programs.
At the same time, revenue-increasing measures must reverse the recent trend of disproportionately favoring upper-income taxpayers.
The first priority should be to tackle the 10-year fiscal imbalances, which would also be the best way to promote economic growth and minimize the risks I have outlined.
Using structural measures to address the 10-year deficits would address our long-term imbalances as well.

For example, if the tax cuts for those earning above $200,000 were repealed and the inheritance tax as reformed were continued rather than eliminated, the 10-year projected deficit would be reduced by roughly $1.1 trillion, or almost 25 percent, and the 75-year fiscal reduction would be roughly $3.9 trillion, or approximately equal to the Social Security shortfall.
We should also begin a serious bipartisan process on Medicare to identify possible solutions and create public support for action, because doing so is absolutely key to our long-run fiscal health.
Despite the focus in Washington today on Social Security, it is a smaller and less pressing problem, and our political system can bear only so much traffic at one time.

If we were to address Social Security now, whatever we do must not increase federal deficits and borrowing but instead must improve fiscal conditions and increase national savings in both the short and long terms.
The proposal that the administration has embraced -- private accounts plus progressive price indexing of benefits -- would result in additional deficits and borrowing of more than $1 trillion in the first 10 years, more than $3 trillion in the second 10 years, and so on for roughly 50 years.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That's because this approach -- which would eliminate only about one-third of the projected 75-year Social Security deficit -- calls for private accounts that would involve immediate and large continuing costs while the savings begin only in the second decade and would grow slowly.
While some estimate that after 50-plus years those savings will exceed costs on a cumulative basis, projected savings 50 years out will do nothing to offset the impact of increased deficits on interest rates.
After all, if markets took into account 50-year projections of fiscal conditions, interest rates would already be through the roof.
Of course, we can continue to close our eyes and hope for the best.
There's no way to predict whether that will work for another few months or for many more years.
But the odds are extremely low that our fiscal imbalances will solve themselves, and we place ourselves at great peril by not facing these realities.
Conversely, if we do address these challenges, then with our flexible labor and capital markets, and our historic embrace of change and willingness to take risks, our prospects over time should be very favorable.

If nothing else, United has made itself an airline to be reckoned with -- not in the traditional way, through strong operations, but in a completely new way, by leveraging its weakness.
United's bankruptcy, which has lasted longer than any airline case since 1989, has given the company the opportunity to take steps that other carriers have found difficult, if not impossible.
Cutting wages and benefits, for one.
Renegotiating and rejecting aircraft leases, for another.
And the biggest step: terminating its four employee pension plans.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
His timing could not have been better: United has used Chapter 11 to shield itself from the most vicious competitive pressures in the industry's history.
In the process, it has accumulated more clout than it might have as just another struggling airline.

"They're seen as being strong because they're in bankruptcy," said Gary N. Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester,Mass.
"It's a remarkable use of bankruptcy as a strategy."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
On the surface, however, it seems like an accidental plan.
United's 30 months in bankruptcy have been akin to a corporate soap opera -- call it "As the Plane Diverts" for all its many twists and turns.
Early on, for example, United promised that it would shift 30 percent of its domestic flights to a new low-fare subsidiary, but the new unit, called Ted, handles only about half that many.
Along the way, Mr. Tilton and United's chief financial officer, Frederic F. Brace III, have made numerous forecasts about when their airline would emerge from bankruptcy.
Now the projection is this fall -- and many analysts say they believe the airline will miss this forecast, too.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Even then, it took the airline 11 months after the final rejection to get around to terminating its four pension plans, a step that it has always said would be crucial to landing the financing it needs to emerge from bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy experts say United's case is unusually slow.
"Over two years, you're into a long case," said Lynn M. LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Only one in seven bankruptcies lasts as long as United's, he said.
"It was clear we would have to avail ourselves of just about everything available to us in Chapter 11."
The denial of loan guarantees -- along with soaring fuel prices, which have forced the airline to rewrite its business plan several times -- have been the major reasons the case has dragged on so long, Mr. Tilton said.

Nonetheless, the length of the case has caused its competitors consternation.
The situation particularly riles Delta's chief executive, Mr. Grinstein, who has steadfastly prevented his airline from seeking bankruptcy protection even though, last fall, it was just hours from toppling.
Though not uttering the name "United," Mr. Grinstein said in a recent interview that bankruptcy should be a quicker process.
"It should be, you've got to go in, you've got to restructure and then come out and go on if you can make it in the marketplace," he said.
"And that's not what's happening."

But Mr. Grinstein has suffered by comparison.
While United has been able to renegotiate repeatedly the terms of its bankruptcy financing, Delta is now begging lenders for more lenient terms in order to avoid having to seek bankruptcy protection.

And while United's lawyers successfully argued to have a federal judge replace employee pension plans with less-expensive retirement programs, Delta is among the still-solvent airlines trying to persuade Congress to give them more time to pay overdue contributions to their traditional employee retirement plans.

In frustration, Mr. Grinstein said he recently appealed to White House officials for help in addressing the industry's problems.
Their answer: you can fix all those problems if you'll just file for Chapter 11, Mr. Grinstein said he was told.
In an earlier time, of course, Mr. Tilton, might have been criticized for lingering in bankruptcy so long.
And there is still plenty of room for debate and skepticism about whether he can successfully bring the company out of Chapter 11.

For one thing, United's losses continue to mount: its first quarter net loss, including bankruptcy-related charges, more than doubled to $1.1 billion from the same period a year earlier.
In total, it has lost almost $6 billion while in bankruptcy.
But others see deeper obstacles.
"It is not a sure thing that they will be able to restructure," said Philip A. Baggaley, an airline industry analyst with Standard & Poor's ratings services.

Colleen C. Barrett, the president of Southwest, said recently that United and US Airways -- which is also under bankruptcy protection as it reorganizes its finances for the second time in three years -- were out of step with reality in the domestic market.
"The elephant is dying," Ms. Barrett was quoted as saying in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Nonetheless, Mr. Tilton is speaking confidently about what lies ahead.
He paints a picture of a company heavily focused on its international operations, with more than half its revenue coming from flights to Asia and other destinations abroad.
United has clung to its international routes despite calls to sell some of them, as Pan Am, T.W.A.
Of course, Mr. Tilton has not done all this alone: lacking airline experience before joining United, he has relied on veteran executives led by Mr. Brace, the chief financial officer, and John P. Tague, United's chief marketing officer.

There is an expensive legal team at work as well, headed by James H.M. Sprayregen, a feisty partner at Kirkland & Ellis, the Chicago law firm.
Consultants from McKinsey & Company are on the scene, too.
All told, United has paid out more than $200 million in fees -- including at least $50 million in legal costs alone -- since its bankruptcy began.
Collectively, this team has managed to fend off people to whom United owes a lot of money.
For instance, despite strike recent threats by United's mechanics, ground workers and flight attendants, the airline's operations have not been interrupted.
Even after it has spent 30 months in bankruptcy, its creditors have not challenged its right to draft a restructuring plan.
And its banks have repeatedly rewritten the terms of its bankruptcy financing (though the interest rate on United's debt is about four percentage points higher than the rate for Southwest, which has the industry's best credit rating).

Frank Lorenzo, the former Texas Air chief executive who oversaw Continental's first bankruptcy filing, in 1983, and was the target of organized labor's wrath for terminating union contracts under the protection of the bankruptcy court, said he was not surprised that United is skating through.
"One of the things about bankruptcy is that 99 times out of 100, people look out for their own best interests," Mr. Lorenzo said in an interview last week.
United's creditors believe the airline "is still the best place" to put their confidence, he said.

A lawyer for the United creditors' committee, Fruman Jacobson, declined comment last week.
DOUGLAS M. STEENLAND, the chief executive at Northwest, says he thinks that there is nothing improper about United's strategy, although he says emphatically that he does not want to follow it himself.
"A lot of things are changing in the industry," he said.
"Everybody's entitled to avail themselves of what the law is."
"Employees, once treated as the heart and soul of the company, are now treated as a despicable expense," she said.

No matter that other airlines may ultimately be forced to copy United's methods -- even to the point of filing for bankruptcy and terminating their pension plans -- so that they can pull equal to it in costs.
"The competition between carriers is so direct and so pointed," Professor Warren said, " that as soon as one gains some kind of cost advantage, the other one feels compelled to match it."
Which, for Mr. Tilton, is the ultimate compliment.

Developers like the Related Group of Florida are taking steps to curb speculation by, for example, requiring a 20 percent deposit so that the investor will not be likely to walk away from his or her condo unit.

"You see a lot more converters stepping up to the plate, whether experienced or new, and they are getting more aggressive and pushing up the prices you need to pay," he said.
But, he said, as long as interest rates remain low, the conversion trend is likely to continue.

Fueling the spurt in condo conversions is the widespread availability of financing, not just from banks but also from other lenders willing to make up the difference between the bank loan and the actual cost of purchase and construction.
Competition among lenders is so feverish that some developers can get away with putting very little of their own money at risk, mortgage brokers say.
"There are promoters putting deals together who are taking out their own equity and replacing it with other people's equity so that they are getting a percentage of the transaction with no money in it," said Robert Kaplan, a senior managing director for South Florida for Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, who helps arrange financing for such deals.

Until now, Wall Street investment firms have issued their own condo conversion loans but have not sold them on the secondary market as mortgage-backed securities.
But in what real estate specialists said was another sign of the expanding availability of debt financing for this type of property, Credit Suisse First Boston has just finished marketing a bond to institutional investors that was backed by $1.5 billion worth of mortgages for apartment buildings and other properties being transformed into condominiums.
By taking many apartments off the market, condo conversions have actually helped raise apartment occupancy in some areas, said Lloyd Lynford, the president of Reis Inc., a New York research firm.
Apartment companies, whose performance is correlated to job growth as well as interest rates, are the weakest of the REIT sectors.
This has led Equity Residential Properties Trust, the nation's leading apartment landlord, and Post Properties, another apartment REIT, to enter the conversion business themselves.
The success of these efforts has prompted other apartment REIT's to consider following suit, said Craig Leupold, an analyst for Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif.

I know that just to climb the three inches I have, which I've not gone very far, took all of my effort.
I have worked hard since I was a kid and I've done nothing but work to try and pull myself out."

The class a person is born into, she said, is the starting point on the continuum.
"If your goal is to become, on a national scale, a very important person, you can't start way back on the continuum, because you have too much to make up in one lifetime.
You have to make up the distance you can in your lifetime so that your kids can then make up the distance in their lifetime."
Coming to Terms With Life
Ms. Justice is still not fully at ease in the other, well-to-do Pikeville, and in many ways she and her husband had to start from scratch in finding a niche there.
Church is where most people in town find friends and build their social life.
The pastor and his wife, transplants to Kentucky, have become their closest friends.

"Partly the problem is that we're young, for middle-class people, to have kids as old as Will and Anna," Ms. Justice said.
"And the fact that we're raising a niece and nephew, that's kind of a flag that we weren't always middle class, just like saying you went to Berea College tells everyone you were poor."
And though in terms of her work Ms. Justice is now one of Pikeville's leading citizens, she is still troubled by the old doubts and insecurities.
"My stomach's always in knots getting ready to go to a party, wondering if I'm wearing the right thing, if I'll know what to do," she said.
"I'm always thinking: How does everybody else know that?
How do they know how to act?
Why do they all seem so at ease?"
A lot of her energy now goes into Will and Anna.
She wants to bring them up to have the middle-class ease that still eludes her.
"Will and Anna know what it's like to be poor, and now we want them to be able to be just regular kids," she said.

Because Ms. Justice is self-conscious about her teeth -- "the East Kentucky overbite," she says ruefully -- she made sure early on that Anna got braces.
She worries about the children's clothes as much as her own.

As a child, Ms. Justice never had the resources for her homework projects.
"I know it's just a hogan, but making a project that looks like the other kids' projects is part of fitting in."
She nudges both children to talk about what happens in school, to recount the plots of the books they read and to discuss current events.
It is this kind of guidance that distinguishes middle-class children from children of working-class and poor families, according to sociologists who have studied how social class affects child-rearing.
While working-class parents usually teach their children, early on, to do what they are told without argument and to manage their own free time, middle-class parents tend to play an active role in shaping their children's activities, seeking out extracurricular activities to build their talents, and encouraging them to speak up and even to negotiate with authority figures.

Ms. Justice's efforts are making a difference.
Will found that he enjoyed Academic Team.
Anna now gets evening phone calls from several friends.
Both have begun to have occasional sleepovers.
And gradually, Ms. Justice is coming to terms with her own life.
On New Year's Eve, after years in a modest rented townhouse, she and her husband moved into a new house that reminds her of the Brady Bunch home.
It has four bedrooms and a swimming pool.
In a few years, when her older cousin retires, Ms. Justice will most likely take over the practice, a solid prospect, though far less lucrative, and less glamorous, than a partnership at her Lexington law firm.
"I've worked very hard all my life -- to have a life that's not so far from where I started out," she said.
"It is different, but it's not the magical life I thought I'd get."

But the Chinese government, unwilling to let that happen, has kept the yuan down by shipping the incoming funds right back out again, buying huge quantities of dollar assets -- about $200 billion worth in 2004, and possibly as much as $300 billion worth this year.
This is economically perverse: China, a poor country where capital is still scarce by Western standards, is lending vast sums at low interest rates to the United States.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Yet the U.S. has become dependent on this perverse behavior.
Dollar purchases by China and other foreign governments have temporarily insulated the U.S. economy from the effects of huge budget deficits.
This money flowing in from abroad has kept U.S. interest rates low despite the enormous government borrowing required to cover the budget deficit.
Low interest rates, in turn, have been crucial to America's housing boom.
And soaring house prices don't just create construction jobs; they also support consumer spending because many homeowners have converted rising house values into cash by refinancing their mortgages.
So why is the U.S. government complaining?
The Treasury report says nothing at all about how China's currency policy affects the United States -- all it offers on the domestic side is the usual sycophantic praise for administration policy.
Instead, it focuses on the disadvantages of Chinese policy for the Chinese themselves.
Since when is that a major U.S. concern?

In reality, of course, the administration doesn't care about the Chinese economy.
It's complaining about the yuan because of political pressure from U.S. manufacturers, which are angry about those Chinese trade surpluses.
So it's all politics.
And that's the problem: when policy decisions are made on purely political grounds, nobody thinks through their real-world consequences.

Here's what I think will happen if and when China changes its currency policy, and those cheap loans are no longer available.
U.S. interest rates will rise; the housing bubble will probably burst; construction employment and consumer spending will both fall; falling home prices may lead to a wave of bankruptcies.

In other words, we've developed an addiction to Chinese dollar purchases, and will suffer painful withdrawal symptoms when they come to an end.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
I'm not saying we should try to maintain the status quo.
Addictions must be broken, and the sooner the better.
After all, one of these days China will stop buying dollars of its own accord.
And the housing bubble will eventually burst whatever we do.
Besides, in the long run, ending our dependence on foreign dollar purchases will give us a healthier economy.
In particular, a rise in the yuan and other Asian currencies will eventually make U.S. manufacturing, which has lost three million jobs since 2000, more competitive.
But the negative effects of a change in Chinese currency policy will probably be immediate, while the positive effects may take years to materialize.
And as far as I can tell, nobody in a position of power is thinking about how we'll deal with the consequences if China actually gives in to U.S. demands, and lets the yuan rise.

Then on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed's regional manufacturing barometer for May came in way below market expectations, falling to 7.3, from 25.3 the month before, and well under the forecast of 17.3.
"Data like that would normally have the market going in a different direction," said Timothy J. Leach, chief investment officer at U.S. Trust.

Oil is now at its lowest price since February and if it can stabilize in the $40's, Mr. Leach said, "that could be the instigator of something positive in the market."

The oil decline, he said, provides relief for both those worried about slower economic growth and those concerned about inflationary pressures.
The Bush administration's new push for China to revalue its currency, the yuan, may have also helped sentiment last week, he said.
The stock rally comes at a time when investor sentiment is moving back toward the average for the last five and a half years, according to an index compiled by the American Association of Individual Investors.

But Mr. Leach said he still expected the price of oil to be volatile, rising into the $50's again, especially as summer approaches.
And he does not think the jawboning of China is something that can bolster sentiment for a long time.

So despite this week's rally, Mr. Leach said that the stock market is likely to be stuck in a trading range until new economic data shows that the soft patch has passed and that inflation is restrained.
Still, this week's rally had some good points, including its breadth.

The images of senators taking to the floor and comparing members of the opposing party to Hitler and "Star Wars" villains may only serve to heighten public discontent with the partisan warfare.
Even a survey done for Senate Republicans found that the party's efforts are hurting them with the public, according to findings distributed on Thursday.
"As a result of this debate, both Senate Republicans and Democrats have seen drops in brand images," said a memorandum from the Senate Republican Conference, "but Democrats are losing much more ground than we are."
Democrats and others dispute that notion, saying that Republicans -- as members of the party controlling the White House as well as the House and Senate -- are suffering the most and will pay the higher political price if the negative view persists into the next election cycle.
But some Democrats are taking no chances.
Many of those involved in negotiations to avert a floor fight represent states won by President Bush in 2004 -- states that might not be too sympathetic to the party's filibuster cause.

The heat lawmakers are taking is proving a source of irritation to some.

Other surveys have shown public regard for Congress dipping near the level of the mid-1990's.
"That is standard when people are fighting," said Nelson W. Polsby, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of "How Congress Evolves."
In a complicated fight like the filibuster showdown, he said, few Americans will digest the details, so they develop an overall negative impression.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Another factor in the public perception, according to some current and former lawmakers, is that Americans have little personal stake in a rules fight and can reach the conclusion that Congress is not looking out for them on pocketbook issues but is instead caught up in self-serving power struggles.

"I think the American people don't concern themselves much with Senate procedure, they are busy with their own lives," said former Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, an Illinois Republican who appeared at the Capitol Friday with other retired Republican senators to show support for ending the filibusters.
"They think more about gas prices."
Some Republicans say they are not surprised at the public dissatisfaction.
They believe they can reverse it once they are better able to make the case on other accomplishments.
"We are moving forward, but these other things tend to dominate the agenda."
Republicans say their polling indicates that since the filibuster debate is now centering on individual nominees, they are making inroads with the public.
And they predict that retaliation by Democrats in the form of stalling legislative activity will boomerang, particularly when much of the public did not understand the underpinnings of the filibuster fight in the first place.

Democrats, well aware of the backlash from the 1995 shutdown, plan to react carefully and will try to derail the Senate majority's agenda without opening themselves to charges of pure obstructionism.
They do not intend to block bills that would shutter national parks and close down social service offices, for instance, but will instead try to force Republicans into problematic votes on health care and jobs bills.
Party strategists in the House and Senate say the Republican effort to ban judicial filibusters plays nicely into their efforts to portray the Republican leadership as too conservative for much of America.
"Republicans are setting the agenda," said Phil Singer, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
"They are responsible."
Political operatives and outside analysts say the public view of Congress could quickly turn around, as it has in the past, and the sour taste from the filibuster fight could fade.
And incumbents have such advantages, they are difficult to dislodge.
The Labor Department's recent inflation report was good news if you don't eat, drive, or belong to the 80 percent of the work force whose pay has failed to keep up with price increases over the past year.
Since a low and stable core rate signals economic growth without overheating, April's number was widely taken to mean the Federal Reserve would continue to raise interest rates gradually.
Families, on the other hand, have little reason to cheer.
The core rate is meaningful for financial markets, but real people buy food and gas.
Moreover, the smaller a paycheck is, the bigger the percentage of pay that is consumed by essentials.
Poor families, for instance, spend at least four times as much of their pay on energy as rich families do.
To make matters worse, the paycheck itself is shrinking.
For non-managers in both white- and blue-collar jobs, hourly wage gains have failed to beat inflation in every month for the past year.
When that happens, the only way to get ahead is to work more.
Earlier this month the government reported that the average workweek lengthened in April, raising hopes that weekly earnings would at last begin to outpace price increases.
But inflation has eaten up all of the income from the additional work -- and more: over the past year, average weekly earnings have fallen by 0.3 percent after inflation.
So far, easy credit, like home equity loans and credit cards, has papered over the steady falloff in workers' purchasing power.
But debt levels can quickly turn onerous.
The latest inflation numbers are as much a cause for concern as for celebration.
But the balloting showed unmistakably that if Mr. Schröder is fed up with being on the losing side of state elections, Germany is fed up with him, and he knows it.

And Germany's being fed up with him is in its way a historic moment.
It is possible that his party's defeat in its traditional stronghold spells the end of traditional social democracy altogether in Germany, with its roots deep in the 19th century.
Mr. Schröder is at the head of a party burdened by a contradiction.
That is because, as most economists have been saying for years, Germany's biggest problem is its high cost of labor, and to make labor less expensive meant trimming what workers saw as some of its prerogatives -- almost unlimited unemployment compensation, for example.

Some of the particularities of the vote in North Rhine-Westphalia demonstrate just how dire Mr. Schröder's situation has become.
For months, members of his party were saying that if they lost there, it would be because their own working-class voters, suffering under the chancellor's reforms and seeing no improvement in the economy, would simply stay home on election day.

Some of that probably did happen Sunday, but that is not what took place primarily.
And there were more working class people and unemployed among them than ever before, according to Forschungsgruppe Wahlen in Mannheim, a research institute that studies election results.

Under the circumstances, Mr. Schröder acted the classic part of a man who knows he has two ways of losing, quickly or slowly -- and he decided that quickly would be better.
Though it was hard to find a commentator in Germany on Monday who gave him much of a chance of winning either way, quickly also gives him at least an outside chance.
By leaving early, for example, he heads off the possibility of a revolt on the left of his party and its slow fissuring, which was already happening, with him in power.
Second, he will not have to govern powerlessly for a long 16 months until September 2006, even as he gains whatever capital might accrue from having taken a bold stroke.
Perhaps most important, he forces his likely opponent, Angela Merkel, to specify a detailed alternative program of reform, so that from now on the election will be one for her to lose.
As previous opponents can testify, it has always been a mistake to underestimate Mr. Schröder's ability to start from behind -- 17 points behind Mrs. Merkel according to current polls -- and finish ahead.

And one advantage for Mr. Schröder is that he has changed the subject, from his failures as chancellor and the country's intractable unemployment, to whether his opponent will be any better, and a change of subject at this point can only help.
By adding his name and fame to this project, then, Mr. Debbouze hopes not only to educate the French about the forgotten role played by 110,000 Arab and 20,000 black African colonial soldiers in the liberation of France, but also to awaken the country's Arab and African populations to their French identity.

Mr. Debbouze, 29, who is also the film's co-producer, said that for those soldiers, "it was almost a rite of passage to sacrifice themselves."
He added, "But in our history books, their contribution isn't mentioned even once, and this isn't right."
"I'm fed up with having to defend my right to live in this country," he said.
"Me, I'm French, proud of it."
Born to Moroccan immigrants in France, Mr. Debbouze pokes fun at his family, the French ruling class and life in the rough, ethnically mixed Parisian suburbs, like Trappes, where he grew up.
Known throughout France simply as Jamel, he is a rapid-fire master of improvisation, ghetto slang and verbal garbles whose barbs about the vagaries of ethnic integration here have made him a one-man theatrical phenomenon.

In one popular act, "Ramadan Surprise," he recalls the times there was nothing at all in the family's refrigerator.
His mother explains that it is an off-season celebration of the Islamic fasting month.
In another, he impersonates an overly dramatic television journalist who ventures into the suburbs convinced that they are teeming with dangerous Muslim fundamentalist drug dealers and finds only a "pleasant suburb where nothing happens."
He confesses that he voted for the center-right president, Jacques Chirac, for re-election in 2002 under orders from his mother.

In "Astérix and Obélix: Mission Cleopatra" the next year, Mr. Debbouze played an incompetent Egyptian architect who never made his deadlines and put doors near ceilings, justifying them by saying, "In case you ever want to build a second floor."

He says he is irritated that most articles about him say he is one of France's highest-paid actors.
Yet in a country where Frenchmen with Arab-sounding last names have difficulty renting apartments, he said he chose to pay more than $3 million for one in the St.-Germain-des-Prés area with a view of the Panthéon.
"I am loaded with money," he said.
"I have a Ferrari, a 4x4 Cadillac, a 1966 Ford Mustang that belonged to Gene Kelly.

In "Indigènes" -- which is directed by Rachid Bouchareb, also a Frenchman of Arab origin -- Mr. Debbouze is working for the minimum union wage for actors, about $23,000 for the entire film.
The budget is $18 million, not high for a war movie by American standards.
Still, $1 million more needs to be raised.
"Indigènes" is being filmed at a time when France is coming to grips with its colonial past, including the contribution of the colonial soldiers who fought to free the country in World War II.
In a speech in Marseille last August marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Provence, Mr. Chirac extended the country's "infinite gratitude" to the World War II soldiers recruited by France from a score of North and West African colonies.
In anticipation of the anniversary last year, the French government increased the pensions by amounts ranging from 20 to 100 percent.

"I'm not an advocate of revenge," Mr. Debbouze said.

Running a hedge fund can be both lucrative and fun.
That power angered German politicians, though, and the fund mangers face investigations.
In the long run, it is unlikely that the returns of most hedge funds will justify the fees.
Hedge funds can do well because the managers are geniuses, but there may not be enough of those to go around.
Or they can do well by being average performers and using the magic of leverage to multiply the return on equity.
But the increase in short-term interest rates has made leverage more costly.

THERE is a problem with a fee schedule that gives the decision maker a big cut of the profits but requires others to bear the losses.
As in baseball, those swinging for the fences are more likely to strike out.
Around 10 percent of hedge funds go out of business each year, Tremont says.
Add in the sharp rise in recent years in highly risky loans to speculative borrowers, some of them packaged into odd securities bought by hedge funds, and the potential is there for significant market disruption if many hedge funds try to bail out of the same things at the same time.

Hedge funds will not be the only scapegoat candidates if there is a meltdown.
If it appears that some derivative security allowed hedge fund managers to gamble with little or no real equity invested, calls for regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market could multiply.
Whether or not this will matter to ordinary investors is another consideration.
Any new hedge fund problems could be similar.

But with minimal information available about what hedge funds are doing, it is inevitable that there is fear they are up to something bad.
Paganism is the umbrella term for nature-based belief systems; although the exact number of practitioners is unknown, experts say the movement is growing in the United States.
Rites of Spring is among a growing number of pagan festivals -- one popular Web site (www.witchvox.com) lists 50 in the United States this year.
Helen Berger, a professor of sociology at Westchester University, said paganism "includes a number of different religious expressions that fall under the category of earth-based spirituality."
Ms. Berger, the editor of "Witchcraft and Magic: Contemporary North America," which is to be published next month by the University of Pennsylvania Press, estimates there are at least 200,000 practicing pagans in this country.

Announcements ranged from an emotional plea to bless a child born with a serious heart condition to the celebratory sharing of having completed various academic degrees.
One man heralded his new job as a firefighter; a woman told of her new position organizing Earth Day celebrations for her municipality.
"These people don't even know they are pagans," she said, describing the kinds of events with ritual content she is planning for her city next year.
Besides large group rituals, like the maypole, the "weaving of the web," "fire circles" and a coming of age ritual in which three teenage boys were ceremonially welcomed into the adult world, the festival included dozens of workshops on topics like "Productive Interfacing with 'Mainstream Religions"'; "Which Witch is Which?"

Margot Adler, who was to present a festival workshop on the state of the movement this weekend and is also a National Public Radio correspondent and a recognized witch, has been tracking nature-based religions since 1979, when she first published "Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess Worshipers and Other Pagans in America Today" (Penguin).
The book is credited with both documenting new religious impulses and being a catalyst for the panoply of practices now in existence.

In an interview, Ms. Adler said, "This is a religion that says the world, the earth, is where holiness resides; it also says that there is no one path to the sacred."
"You don't have to get it whittled down to one answer, one god, one way of being, one form of society, one philosophy," she said.

Ms. Adler and others who study paganism credit its growth to several factors, including the rise of the women's movement, which was attracted to the notion that the divine includes feminine forms, and to environmentalism, which is prompting the search for religious expressions that see spirituality as being a part of nature rather than above it.

Over the last five years, President Bush has done an excellent job in managing relations with China -- it's one of his very few successes in foreign policy -- but lately he has engaged in protectionism.
Sure, China's cheap yuan has cost us manufacturing jobs -- but it has also led to a flood of Chinese capital to America, keeping interest rates low.
If we blame China for lost American jobs in making shirts, we should credit it for new American jobs in banking and construction.
Americans are also unfair in accusing China of not stopping North Korea's nuclear program.
The reality is that the North Koreans don't listen to the Chinese about anything, and many on each side look down on the other.
Privately, some Chinese dismiss the North Koreans as "Gaoli bangzi" or Korean hillbillies.
And fortified by a bit of liquor, North Koreans denounce Chinese as unscrupulous, money-grubbing traitors.
Whenever I meet North Koreans, I tell them that the Chinese government doesn't like me -- and my status soars.

China has been pushing hard in the last two years for a negotiated solution to the North Korean crisis, and it at least has a coherent policy on North Korea.
That's more than you can say for the Bush administration.

One of the biggest risks for U.S.-China relations is the -- very outside -- chance that President Bush will order a military strike on the North Korean nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
Most experts say that the resulting radiation leakage would probably not harm nearby countries, and in any case South Korea and Japan would be more at risk than China.
But any hint that radiation had reached the Chinese coast would provoke anti-American fury across China.

There's a third big danger for U.S.-China relations, and this one is Beijing's fault: China's schools teach hatred of Japan, resulting in last month's street demonstrations in which Chinese protesters screamed slogans such as "Japanese must die."

The next act in the drama will unfold at sea.
Japanese ships may start exploring disputed waters for oil and gas in the late summer or fall, perhaps with military escorts.
China's leaders will then be under tremendous popular pressure to send China's own military vessels to block what Chinese will see as an armed Japanese incursion.
And then Japan will ask the U.S. for help under the U.S.-Japan security treaty.
The new president, Hu Jintao, seems much less likely to go out on a limb to preserve good relations with the U.S.
So it's time for Americans to take a deep breath.
Poisonous trade disputes with China will only aggravate the risks ahead, strengthen the hard-liners in Beijing and leave ordinary Chinese feeling that Americans are turning into China-bashers.
Sadly, they'll have a point.

"This time around, the Fed's policies have played a part," said Nigel Gault, a senior economist at Global Insight, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.

Others worry that the Federal Reserve has tacitly encouraged risky speculation through its role as a chief regulator of the banking industry, which has steadily relaxed lending standards and allowed home buyers to borrow more money through higher-risk loans.
"Now he has failed to stop the alarming deterioration of mortgage lending standards to stop the housing bubble."
Even though mortgage rates remain at their lowest point in decades, more than half of all new mortgages are either interest-only loans or adjustable-rate loans that start out cheap but can become very costly if rates rise.

Rather, they contend, the central bank's job is to keep inflation low and to promote the maximum sustainable growth without fueling inflation.

But the Fed faces an unusual problem: it has raised the Federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks eight times since last June, but long-term interest rates and mortgage rates are actually lower than they were one year ago.
The unexpected persistence of low long-term interest rates -- which Mr. Greenspan called a "conundrum" in February -- has driven the sales and prices of housing to record levels.

In the wake of the stock market bubble, Mr. Greenspan and other top Fed officials argued that it was a mistake to try to head off potential bubbles, in part because they are difficult to identify in advance and in part because the effort might easily cause more damage than it prevents.

Benedict Nightingale, the chief theater critic of The Times of London, said Mr. Rylance had managed to challenge convention without rejecting tradition.
Audiences "stretch their inner muscles in a theater that, under Rylance, has become a gymnasium for the imagination," Mr. Nightingale noted recently.
Now, at the end of this year, after touring "Measure for Measure" in the United States, Mr. Rylance will hand over the job of artistic director to Dominic Dromgoole, a respected stage director who runs the Oxford Stage Company.
But he has no plans to walk away from what has become a labor of love.
"I'm absolutely serious when I say that I have no intention of playing Shakespeare in this country in any other theater," he said.
"I'm 45 and I'd like to be a supporter of the place until I die."

Since 1995, when he led workshops in the unfinished theater, Mr. Rylance has been interested not only in recreating a particular theater, but also in recreating a particular theatrical experience.
In Tim Carroll's new production of "The Tempest," just three actors -- Mr. Rylance, Edward Hogg and Alex Hassell -- play all the roles (albeit accompanied by three dancers and six singers).
The idea, Mr. Carroll said, is that the play's island represents Prospero's internal world, one in which he is torn between Ariel's spirit and mind and Caliban's earthiness and sensuality.
It is no coincidence that this play and this interpretation should coincide with Mr. Rylance's final season as artistic director.
"The Tempest" is probably the last play written entirely by Shakespeare, with Prospero's Epilogue often thought to represent the playwright's own farewell.
More to the point, in this case Prospero's inner conflict between spirit and earth mirrors Mr. Rylance's view of the battle between mind and body in Shakespearean theater today.

"But the Globe resonates with what's needed now, at least in our culture, which is something much more visceral," he said.
"Shakespeare needs to be dragged out of the classrooms so that kids can meet him on the stage, not the page."
Even at the Globe, though, this struggle is seemingly not over.

In contrast, he added, in conventional theaters, this is not possible.
"It's only since the electric light was invented that the audience has gone into complete darkness," he said.
"So it's only recently that we have been divided from the audience.
And I have to say that that is the responsibility of directors, who have become obsessed with controlling the whole thing.
That's why I'm fed up with it all.
Directors stand in the way between actors and audience."
Perhaps.
The Globe has left Mr. Rylance with little time for other work.
At the moment, Mr. Rylance is working on a new play in a collective approach reminiscent of that of Elizabethan times with Claire van Kampen, his wife; Mr. Oswald; and Mr. Carroll.
He is also preparing a television version of "The Golden Ass," Mr. Oswald's play based on a Latin novel, which was presented at the Globe in 2002.
But, he said, he has decidedly not gone looking for movie paydays.
If money were the main objective, "I would have become a lawyer or a doctor or something like that."
In limiting risk, people also limit the opportunity for gain.
It is common, today, for investors to own six or eight mutual funds, each of which is likely to be invested in hundreds of stocks.
This will, they hope, assure that no little bump, no little meltdown, overly upsets their portfolios.
But since when was investing about avoiding the bumps?
Anyone investing for the longer term can safely ignore them.

George Bernard Shaw observed that every profession is a conspiracy against the laity.
The financial profession duly warns us of meltdown risk, but it has adopted a pinched definition of risk that has led us into fruitless and sometimes harmful diversions.
The odds of a meltdown being necessarily uncertain, Wall Street fosters an overly precise, pseudoscientific approach.
Investors are told to "balance" portfolios (rather than to select stocks), to "allocate" (rather than to "invest") their assets and to reckon with quarterly earnings forecasts down to the penny per share -- an absurd irrelevancy for someone whose retirement is years away.
Wall Street properly worries about what might go wrong, but it has recast the issue in spurious terms, detaching us from the messy and often subjective considerations that might help us avoid truly perilous bubbles: those that (like the dot-coms) subject us to the risk of enduring loss.
If you tune in to enough financial shows, you are bound to stop asking considered questions like "Is the Web going to be full of other companies competing against this one?"
and to start toying with numerics like a stock's volatility or the percent of your holdings in a given "sector."
No wonder people are jittery: this stuff changes every second.
To listen to the anchors on cable TV, we should reshuffle our portfolios in response to each new, tangential threat -- oil prices, the dollar, real estate.
And, of course, we should diversify in the extreme.
Diversification is insurance against the possibility that we might do something stupid; it also heightens the chance that we will do something stupid.
People with flood insurance build their homes closer to the shore, and people in the 90's, having diversified, figured they could afford to take at least a small flier on dot-coms.
Risk prevention can lead to risk.

Lately, our search for calamity has focused on those obscure but swiftly multiplying Wall Street beasts, "hedge funds."
Why some private-investment partnerships (which is what hedge funds are) should be cause for general alarm has to do with their pervasive character.

But hedge funds are less an expression of risk-taking than of people's aversion to risk.
Most funds deliberately try to hedge their bets (thus the name) by going both long and short -- that is, betting that one asset will rise while a related one falls.
They are thus designed to be less volatile than ordinary stocks, which is why they are so fashionable.
The risk isn't meltdown but mediocrity, a glimpse of which may be seen in the industry's recently lackluster returns.
Real estate, the runner-up to hedge funds in the anxiety sweepstakes, could be another matter.
A recent Lehman Brothers report, "The Changing Landscape of the Mortgage Market," observed that U.S. homeowners have been "very willing to increase their leverage .
through products like IO loans and MTA ARMs."
This refers to interest-only mortgages, and to those in which the rate begins at an alluring, below-market level but after an interim floats according to the yield on Treasury bills.
Who in his right mind would take an "IO- MTA ARM"?
Although my bank did not describe it this way, an adjustable-rate mortgage is a bet between the bank and the homeowner.
If rates fall or remain stable, I win; if rates rise, I lose.
Of course, if I lose, the bank might also lose.
I might, heaven forbid, default.

Why would a bank finance a home that under a conventional mortgage the borrower could not afford?
What makes this bet rather interesting is that millions of other people have the same kind of loan that I do.
If rates should take a sudden upturn, it is conceivable that a good many will default, in which case an instrument (a floating-rate mortgage) conceived to help the bank manage interest-rate risk will have resulted in increasing the bank's losses.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The saving grace is that home loans generally are the last thing people default on.
But imagine how scary it would be if, say, businesses extended floating-rate contracts to one another -- if virtually every company were dependent on making the right calculation about how these risk-avoidance vehicles would function.
Well, actually, they do.
They are called derivatives.
Derivatives are contracts that call for one party to pay another according to the movement of an underlying yardstick, like a foreign currency, a bond, a stock or even the weather.
Since the 1980's, Wall Street has marketed derivatives as a tool for making risk more palatable, and Alan Greenspan has consistently praised them for enabling firms to spread, or "manage," their risk.
For instance, a bank can hedge against the risk that one of its loans will sour.
It simply -- well, not so simply -- purchases a "credit default swap," which entitles it to a payoff if a specified company, G.M.
for instance, goes into default or suffers a material downgrade in its credit rating.
The party on the other side might be a hedge fund that is more sanguine on G.M.
's bonds or has a way (it thinks) to hedge that risk.
Every financial firm uses some varieties of derivatives, which, again, are contracts that call for a payment (one way or other) depending on some underlying asset.
Their growth has been explosive.
Credit-default swaps, for instance, didn't exist a decade ago; today there are $8 trillion of them.
No one has any idea of the losses that could ensue from a panic; credit-default swaps "have never been stress-tested," notes the analyst James Bianco.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Neither the Fed nor the S.E.C.
has ever really clamped down on derivatives or insisted on a form of disclosure that would tell folks what is going on.
So forget hedge funds; if you're searching for the next financial storm, try derivatives.
(Nothing much you can do about them, either.)
Come to think of it, most of the sudden financial disasters of the previous decade -- Orange County, L.T.C.M., Enron -- involved derivatives, too.
There is a paradox here.
A vehicle developed to help reduce individual risk has heightened risk to the system.
There was a time, of course, when people could buy only the homes they could afford and invested in only a few, carefully chosen stocks -- when traders could not run certain risks because no derivatives existed to provide a hedge.
Today, whether you are a trader or homeowner, bank or corporate treasurer, our financial culture offers a prophylactic against every conceivable worry.
Maybe weaving a giant insurance net is really the way to manage anxiety, but maybe it has us worrying about what we will do if the insurance fails.
Perhaps, if there were fewer traders dulling their anxieties with financial Zoloft and fewer investment options available to the rest of us, we would make better decisions -- and sleep more soundly.
THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 6-5-05 Roger Lowenstein, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about reforming the quality of health care.
Dr. Benetti is working with the Snapper Farm off Puerto Rico, a recipient of a NOAA grant.
But critics are worried that NOAA, a branch of the Commerce Department, has not addressed the health and environmental problems of existing fish farms: pollution from wastes, chemicals and drugs; the impact of escapes on wild fish, including transference of disease and parasites; the dependence on wild fish, which are used as feed for the farmed fish; and the impact on traditional fishing.
"I believe aquaculture is incredibly important," said Dr. Jane Lubchenco, a professor of zoology at Oregon State University and member of the commission.
"Now is the time to make sure it grows in a way that is good for human health and the environment.
I would like to see the right kinds of checks and balances before we launch into this massive offshore experiment and it is too late."
Dr. William T. Hogarth, NOAA Fisheries Service director, agrees.
"I'll be the first to admit there is a lot of controversy," he said.
"We have to do aquaculture in an environmentally safe and compatible way."
It has the support of the Bush administration.

So far there are few answers to the critics' questions, in part because the draft proposal has no environmental rules.

Dr. Rebecca Goldburg, a senior scientist with Environmental Defense, an advocacy group often at odds with the food and agriculture industries, said: "If aquaculture is to be pursued in offshore waters, Americans want it to be with very stringent safeguards.
They have to think through the potential for fish escapes, where fish farms can be located to minimize impacts of water pollution and spread of disease."
For that reason, Dr. Hogarth says, pens should be stocked with only native species.

But Dr. Goldburg said even escapes of indigenous species could cause problems.
For example, the fertilized eggs of cod cannot be contained in ocean pens, and the fish that hatch from them could have an impact on the seriously depleted stocks of wild cod.
Proponents of offshore fish farming believe that if the farms are placed in the deep ocean, strong currents could dilute waste, uneaten food and medications from the pens.
Ocean pens would also put the farms out of the reach of state authorities.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Dr. Goldburg said scattering the farms might ease the pollution problem, but she added, "They do tend to cluster the farms because of proximity to feed and processing plants."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The environmentally acceptable size of fish farms is another unknown.
Dr. Benetti of the University of Miami said, "We are not economically sustainable, so we must scale up, and as you scale up you might see some impact."
Rather than increasing the overall food supply, most fish farms provide substitutes for expensive wild species.
"The perception of aquaculture is that it plays a key role in providing food for a burgeoning human population," Dr. Lubchenco said, "but most segments of aquaculture, like salmon and shrimp, are not providing food for the poor but for white-tablecloth restaurants."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The fish that should be farmed, because of their smaller environmental impact, said Dr. Lubchenco, are herbivores and omnivorous freshwater fish like tilapia, carp and catfish, and mollusks like oysters and mussels.
But the money is in carnivores.
And farming tuna, salmon and swordfish depletes populations of wild fish, which are needed to make fish meal.
It takes about three pounds of wild fish to produce one pound of farmed salmon.
One of the most environmentally sensitive methods of aquaculture is integrated fish farming, in which mussels, seaweeds and other species are grown in close proximity with fin fish to recycle waste.
In Canada, Dr. Thierry Chopin, professor of marine biology at the University of New Brunswick in St. John, has been growing seaweed, salmon and mussels in the Bay of Fundy since 2001.
The seaweed and mussels consume some of the waste from the salmon.
Studies have shown that the chemicals fed to the salmon are not passed on to the mussels or the seaweed, making them safe to eat.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Dr. Chopin's program has grown but is not yet commercial.
Few companies are interested because integrated farming, in which several species must be monitored, is much more complicated.
Some states are worried about the federal government's plans and have already taken action.
Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, has introduced a bill to prohibit the development of new offshore aquaculture operations until there is legislation to address all the potential problems.
California recently passed stringent regulations governing aquaculture off its coast.
"If we get anything close to the California bill, I think we will be doing well," Dr. Lubchenco said.
"But I'm skeptical."
WASHINGTON, June 6 - Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned Monday night that the baffling persistence of low long-term interest rates was driving investors to hunt for higher returns by plowing money into hedge funds that will not be able to deliver on their promises.
Speaking to a conference of central bankers in Beijing, Mr. Greenspan reiterated that he is perplexed that long-term Treasury bond rates are lower today than they were a year ago, when the Federal Reserve began systematically raising short-term rates.
The persistence of cheap money is "clearly without recent precedent" and defies simple explanation, Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan warned that low rates are driving investors to seek higher returns by taking on higher financial risks -- particularly in hedge funds and private equity funds that hold out the prospect of higher profits through sophisticated trading strategies.
He took particular aim at packages of debt known as collateralized debt obligations, which have been one of the fastest- growing businesses on Wall Street.

Mr. Greenspan raised worries about the proliferation of hedge funds based on arcane but not fully tested trading strategies.

"I have no doubt that many of the new hedge fund entrepreneurs are embracing a strategy of pinpointing temporary market inefficiencies, the exploitation of which is expected to yield above-average rates of return," Mr. Greenspan said.
But, he cautioned, "most of the low-hanging fruit of readily available profits" has already been picked.
Normally, long-term rates climb when the Fed raises short-term rates.
But rates on 10-year Treasury bonds, which directly affect rates for mortgages and corporate bonds, have declined nearly one percentage point, to less than 4 percent, since the Fed began raising rates in June 2004.

On one level, the euro has been a great success.
Travel among the 12 countries that use it is far easier, and companies in those countries can contract with others knowing there is no currency risk involved.
But economic integration of the euro zone has not come as rapidly as some had hoped and that has created stresses.
"You cannot succeed over any length of time with one monetary policy and 12 fiscal policies," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG Inc.
Europe tried to finesse that fact with an agreement that no government using the euro would allow its budget deficit to exceed more than 3 percent of gross domestic product, but in fact a number of countries have exceeded that limit.
Rather than levy fines, as was envisioned, the response thus far has been to weaken the rule while encouraging countries to do better.

To the extent that Europe does pursue excessively easy fiscal policies, the response would probably be a weakening of the currency, as has happened in recent weeks.
That has aroused concern in Europe even though some, including Mr. Berlusconi, have been loudly calling for a weaker euro for many months.

When the euro was being designed, some economists forecast that European countries would be forced to liberalize their economies because devaluation within the euro zone would be impossible.
In that context, liberalization refers to making an economy more flexible, with workers easier to hire and fire.
Most European governments have tried to follow that prescription in one way or another, but anger from voters and unions has forced retreats, and in some countries liberalization has become very unpopular.
Since the euro was introduced, those trends have continued, but devaluation is out of the question.
Italy is now in recession.

Blaming Europe for national problems has happened in countries besides Italy and pressure has been growing on the European Central Bank to lower its short-term interest rate, now at 2 percent.
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the central bank, has backed away from statements ruling out a rate cut, though he has not endorsed one.
Lower interest rates might help stimulate European economies, and a lower euro could help exporters, but neither would address issues of Italy's competitive position with other parts of Europe.
Its position has also been hurt because some of its traditional industries, like textiles, have been damaged by Chinese competition.
It is not clear how Italy, or any other country in the euro, could withdraw if it wished to do so.
The Maastricht Treaty that established the currency has no withdrawal provision.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
If a country were to insist on withdrawing, presumably it could.
But there would be the risk of higher interest rates and a greater reluctance of foreigners to invest.
There would also be issues of whether debts contracted in euros could be converted to national currencies that might then depreciate against the euro.
For now, it is unlikely that talk of countries getting out of the euro will advance very far.
But the talk highlights that the financial unification of Europe is a work in progress, one that has not advanced as rapidly as its advocates expected.

"We are proceeding too slowly," Mr. Trichet said this week in Beijing, where he was attending a conference of central bankers, "but we are proceeding with unifying the market."
In effect, the bond market -- where long-term interest rates, including those for mortgages, are set -- is stimulating the economy while the Fed is trying to stabilize it.

In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan warned that the economy faces significant imbalances and made it clear the Fed is not finished ratcheting up interest rates.

The list of reasons for the falling rates is both long and controversial, taking in everything from the aging of the population to the economic growth of China.
Economists generally argue that investor psychology also plays some hard-to-define role and that rates will soon rise.
But they have been making the same prediction for the last year.
"Since I've been in the business in the mid-1980's, this is the biggest disconnect between the bond market and the economy I've ever seen -- easily," said Ethan S. Harris, the chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers and a former Fed staff member.
"You've got almost the exact opposite response in the bond market from the normal response."

Although they have vexed policy makers and economists, falling long-term rates have benefited Americans across the economic spectrum.

Calvin S. Jackson, a 53-year-old college math teacher in Atlanta, decided he would start looking to buy his first house even though home prices have been rising.
"The current market makes it very, very encouraging to borrow money, to take a chance and buy a home," Mr. Jackson said.
"This is the time to move."
In the past, a two-point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate has typically led to a one-point rise in long-term bond rates.
Simple logic suggests that when the cost of borrowing money for a year goes up, as it has, so should the cost of a 30-year loan.

The Fed, after keeping its benchmark rate unusually low in the wake of the 2001 recession, began raising it almost a year ago as inflation picked up.
At about 3 percent, annual inflation remains lower than it has been for most of the last generation, but it has begun pinching incomes and Fed officials are concerned it might accelerate.

Low interest rates, which encourage people to borrow and spend money, spur demand for goods and tend to push up their prices.

Since last June, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate, which sets the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 3 percent, from 1 percent.
Other consumer interest rates, like those on credit cards and car loans, have increased during the last year, but only slightly.
"It's a conundrum," Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist of the National City Corporation, a major mortgage lender based in Cleveland, said borrowing a word from Mr. Greenspan to describe the growing gap between long-term and short-term rates.

"It's in defiance of economic fundamentals."
The most obvious explanation is that investors simply think the economy is weaker than Fed officials do.
That would cause people to bid up the prices of bonds, which are a conservative investment; bond prices and interest rates always move in opposite directions.
But if the decline in rates were all about the economy, pieces of good economic news would halt it, even temporarily.
That has not happened, Mr. Greenspan said.

He also questioned the widely held belief that foreign banks have kept rates low by buying United States Treasury bonds.
Those purchases help keep foreign currencies inexpensive relative to the dollar and allow other countries to continue exporting cellphones, cars and other goods to the United States.
Long-term rates in other countries, where foreign banks have not been such active buyers, have also dropped, he said.

Two other factors-- the fall in inflation caused by globalization and the buying of long-term bonds by pension funds trying to shore up their finances as baby boomers approach retirement -- are helping keep rates low.
But they do not explain the pattern of the last year, Mr. Greenspan said.

"World demographic trends are hardly news," he said.
The most similar period to the last year might be the late 1980's, when the Fed was raising its benchmark but mortgage rates stayed roughly flat, even dipping somewhat in late 1988.
Today, the Fed seems unlikely to lower its rate anytime soon.
That has caused some mortgage bankers to urge homeowners to grab a 5 percent or 6 percent mortgage while they still can.
"I think people have one more moment to lock in a low rate," said Ellen Bitton, chief executive of Park Avenue Mortgage, which has offices in New York and Palm Beach, Fla.
That might end up being great advice.
It is also very similar to what bankers were saying a year ago.

Mr. Greenspan may have managed, however, to convince some investors that the central bank will be raising interest rates longer than expected, dashing recent speculation that the Fed may stop its monetary tightening by this fall.

For weeks, there has been a tug of war over the economic outlook.
While investors have seemed reassured that inflation is contained, some have been arguing that growth is slowing while others have more confidence in the economy.
So far, it does not appear that Mr. Greenspan has settled the argument.

"I don't think it makes a lot of sense for individual investors to buy longer-term bonds under most scenarios, or even intermediate-term bonds, with rates being so low," said Scott D.

IF so, that means money market rates are almost certain to move higher.
"Even 2 1/2 percent yield still isn't really impressing investors," said Peter G. Crane, vice president and managing editor of iMoneyNet, a tabulator of money fund data in Westborough, Mass.
But he added that a 3 percent rate for money market funds, a psychologically important round number, is on the horizon with the Fed's next policy meeting at the end of the month.
"With that late June Fed hike, if it does come, the very largest retail money funds -- Fidelity Cash Reserves, Vanguard Prime -- that will push them to 3 percent," Mr. Crane predicted.
At that point, money funds would be competitive with ING Direct's Orange savings account, which he called the market bellwether, now at 3 percent, and with EmigrantDirect.com's AmericanDream savings account, now paying 3.25 percent.
Tax-free money funds are especially attractive now, Mr. Crane added, with the most generous of them returning more than 4 1/4 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis to a top-bracket taxpayer.
Yields have "remained just tantalizingly high," he said, even for middle-bracket taxpayers.
"I can't understand why they haven't been knocked down," he said.

Another vehicle for those who hunger for more yield on cash reserves is ultrashort bond funds -- and on June 1, Fidelity Investments made its version less costly.

"I think these are good, too," said Mr. Horsburgh of ultrashort funds, though he noted that the fees eat into returns and that investors can even lose money in them.
"The downside of the ultrashort bond funds is that there's no final maturity," he said.
"So if interest rates rise you could see a very low return" as shrinkage of principal offsets interest income.

A 20-page Fidelity white paper on bonds, available on its Web site, www.fidelity.com, holds that bonds have historically beaten cash -- at only modest risk for bonds of short maturities.
"Eighty percent of the time investors were rewarded for holding short-term bonds instead of cash over a one-year period," according to the paper's authors, George A. Fischer and Shawn M. Verbout.
This "indicates the relatively modest increase in risk of holding a fully diversified portfolio of short-term bonds as a substitute for cash."
At this stage, investors with liquid reserves are indeed fortunate, as rates continue to rebound.
When it appears that the Fed is finished with its credit tightening, he added, it would be time to nail down the prevailing levels for the longer term.

Marketers have long understood that groups of friends and relatives tend to buy the same products, but understanding the reasons has been tricky.
Is it because they are so similar in how much money they make and what television ads they watch that they independently arrive at the same decision?

Three economists recently found a novel way to answer the question across the Atlantic, in Finland.
Like the United States, it is a wealthy country with a largely open economy, where people can buy any of dozens of car models or shoe brands.
But Finland also keeps amazingly detailed records of everything from a household's vehicle purchases to the age, sex and income of people living in the house to the amount they spend each year on commuting.
To understand the researchers' method, imagine three households with nearly the same demographic profile, two that live on the same street and one that lives across town.
If the neighbors are more likely to own the same car than is the faraway family, there is strong evidence of neighborly influence.
In fact, the evidence was overwhelming.

All this seemed to suggest that people do not covet thy neighbor's car so much as they ask their neighbor about his car.
Since used cars are less reliable, an endorsement of one might carry more weight.
The same could be true of the inexpensive cars bought by poorer families.
Low-income and rural households also have less access to car magazines and the Internet, so they might ask friends for advice more often.

Still, analysts pointed to several lingering worries, any of which could cause the economy, and the direction of the markets, to reverse.
These include a bursting of the bubble in housing prices, a significant slowdown in the Chinese economy, and the rising price of oil, which closed at $58.47 a barrel this week.
Some large bond fund managers are still not confident that in the long term, yields will head much higher.
"Everyone has been calling for higher yields for months, and they have all been wrong," said James Keller, who oversees $100 billion worth of government bond investments for Pimco, the giant bond fund manager.
While yields could move higher in the short term, he says they will remain well below 5 percent.

A year after the Fed began raising short-term interest rates, Mr. Gundlach says the Fed is two-thirds through the process.
Sometime in the six months, he said, the Fed will stop raising rates, setting the stage for it to reverse course, and begin lowering rates, sometime next year.
A decline in short-term rates would probably lead to a drop in longer-term bond yields as well, he said.
Investors will also probably remain attracted to the Treasury market, despite the relatively low yields.
He also pointed to weak returns this year for hedge funds, which are investment partnerships for wealthy individuals and large institutions like pension funds.
Those funds on average are returning less than 1 percent so far this year.

But other investors continue to anticipate a prolonged reversal in Treasury yields.
Mr. Johnson said that, despite the uncertainties, he believes that yields will continue to rise.
"I believe we will muddle through," he said.
"But I have my fingers tightly crossed."
For example, a one-cent change in how many dollars it takes to buy a euro -- say, to $1.22 from $1.21 -- amounts to an actual price shift of less than 1 percent.
But in a spot forex trade, when 100-to-1 leverage is used, the same slim move is multiplied a hundredfold.
So there's a $1 increase for each $1 staked by traders on the euro's climb, and an equivalent drop for those expecting the dollar to go higher.

Of course, profits and losses are not realized until a position is closed out.
But investors who leverage themselves to the hilt in pursuit of quick outsize returns often find that they are rapidly burning up the capital in their accounts when a few trades go sour.

Technical traders, who ignore such fundamental issues, instead take positions by analyzing chart patterns with arcane mathematical tools like Fibonacci retracements and Ichimoku clouds.

In the United States, there is some regulation, but it is indirect.
The National Futures Association, a self-regulatory organization, and the federal government's watchdog, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, regulate retail forex firms but not the market itself.
The market has long been plagued by swindlers preying on the gullible, and corralling them has absorbed a big share of the enforcement resources of the N.F.A.
and C.F.T.C.
That places an extra due-diligence burden on would-be traders to investigate thoroughly the background, capitalization and enforcement record of a company before they hand over any money.
An essential starting point is the Web site of the National Futures Association, www.nfa.futures.org.
The association offers a concise brochure on what investors should know about off-exchange forex trading.
It is available at www.nfa.futures.org/investor/forex.asp.
"The best way to improve the industry is to ensure that the customers are educated about the risks and the marketplace," said Ms. Miller of MG Financial.

A federal judge refused a request yesterday from a group of banks to block the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, from seeking further data from the banks about mortgages to lower-income borrowers.
But the judge said he might reconsider if Mr. Spitzer sends subpoenas to the banks.
"I'm just telling you, if a subpoena's issued, then things change," said Judge Sidney Stein, of Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The Office of the Comptroller, which was also represented at the hearing, filed its own lawsuit last week seeking to bar Mr. Spitzer from further examining the banks' data.
Dietrich L. Snell, the deputy attorney general, said after the hearing that the attorney general's office would continue with its investigation.
Mr. Spitzer's office began an investigation in April into whether the banks have discriminated against minority and other vulnerable borrowers by charging high interest rates.
Office rents in Midtown Manhattan have recovered almost to the peak levels of early 2001, providing some rationale for the lofty sales prices.

In recent years, real estate executives have talked about the incongruity of the exceptionally high sales prices for office buildings and the soft rental rates for space within such buildings.
Leasing income would seem to be the fundamental economic underpinning for purchases.
Although the pace of office leasing has slowed in recent weeks, some brokers describe this as a period of adjustment after the hot market of last year and the first quarter of this one.
"The market is pausing to digest," said Mitchell S. Steir, the chief executive of Studley, a brokerage company that mostly represents tenants.
"It is the rational follow-up to a period of peak activity."

Real estate executives say low interest rates and an increased appetite for real estate among institutional investors like pension funds are driving the demand for commercial and residential properties in crucial markets like Manhattan and Washington.

"Ten years ago, real estate was a stepchild for institutional investors, who were mostly interested in stock and bonds," said Paul E. Pariser, a founder of Taconic Investment Partners, which owns, among other properties, 111 Eighth Avenue, which covers the block between 15th and 16th Streets.

"Now funds that allocated 3 percent to real estate have moved to 8 percent, and those that were at 5 percent have moved to 12 percent," Mr. Pariser said.
"Those are big dollars.
When you add three percentage points at a $100 billion institution, that's $3 billion."
Peter Hauspurg, the chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a sales brokerage firm, said: "There is a tremendous amount of capital chasing real estate assets.
History says that we are three years overdue for a correction in pricing, but there is no sign of it."
Indeed, in April, a group of pension funds and Tishman Speyer Properties agreed to pay $1.72 billion for the MetLife Building, the 2.8-million-square-foot tower that rises above Grand Central Terminal.

Part of the reason, he said, is that private investors are willing to take on more debt to make a purchase than are institutions, which tend to have stricter rules about financing acquisitions.
"A private investor can finance 80 percent of a deal, compared to 60 to 65 percent for institutions," Mr. Latham said.

Leasing brokers say that in Midtown, concessions packages -- periods of free rent and contributions toward interior construction -- shrank as the vacancy rate dropped to 10.3 percent in May from 12.3 percent a year earlier, increasing the effective rent.
The effective rent as calculated by Studley includes operating expenses, real estate taxes and the cost of electrical power, making it higher than the nominal base rent.

Barry M. Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, said, "The market is being pulled up from the top," with some prospective tenants willing to pay very high prices for space that meets their needs.
"Financial institutions like hedge funds have set the bar very high in prime buildings in the Plaza District," an area north of Grand Central.

But if the Midtown leasing market is finally recovering from the slump after the Sept. 11 attacks, the downtown market is not.
The vacancy rate there was 16.3 percent in May, compared with 15.2 percent a year earlier, according to CB Richard Ellis.
The rebuilding of 7 World Trade Center is expected to be completed early next year, but no tenants have yet signed up for its 1.7 million square feet.
"Downtown is basically stagnant, although the conversion of office buildings to residential use will eventually be good for the area," Mr. Gosin said.
He noted that the gap between the Midtown rental rates and those downtown has widened, as few office tenants have taken space downtown.
"Now, it is more like $30 a square foot."

Some real estate executives said the decision by the investment banking company Goldman Sachs, the only firm that had committed to building a new office tower near Ground Zero, to suspend its plans was discouraging other tenants from looking for space downtown.
"Unfortunately for the city, the impact of Goldman will be far-reaching," Mr. Steir of Studley said.

Many other social events for the obese are also growing in popularity.
Big Boogie Nights, a San Francisco group that produces nightclub-style dance parties, will begin giving them in New York City this fall.
And Big Moves, which has sponsored dance workshops and dance troupes in the San Francisco area since 2000, is now offering workshops in New York City and has started a troupe in Boston.
Advertisements typically describe events as being for BBW's (Big Beautiful Women) and BHM's (Big Handsome Men), but many of those involved simply call themselves fat.
This, they say, is a conscious attempt to encourage people to regard the word as a run-of-the-mill adjective, not an insult.
Like most event organizers, Ms. Bellemore aims to create an environment in which obese people feel at home.
Every year after the Vegas Bash she receives a flood of e-mail messages from participants who describe missed proms or insulting spouses and how the Vegas Bash helped them mend their wounds.

Liz Nickels, a psychologist in Oakland, Calif., who is 5-foot-7 and 275 pounds, founded Big Adventures to teach obese women to scuba dive.
Among her graduates is Deb Malkin, the vice president of ecommerce for alight.com, a plus-size online clothing company, who learned to dive on a Big Adventures trip in Maui in 2003.
"When it's around issues where we feel segregated, like clothing or fitness and, for some people, dating," Ms. Malkin said, "it's important to be with people who understand you, who don't judge you."
The Big Adventures diving trip inspired Ms. Malkin, who is 5-foot-3 and 245 pounds and lives in Brooklyn, to take up karate and swimming.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 65 percent of American adults 20 years of age and older are overweight, meaning their body mass index is 25 or more, or obese, meaning 30 or higher.
In April a highly publicized study in The Journal of the American Medical Association suggested that people who are somewhat overweight, but not obese, have a lower risk of dying in a given year than those of normal weight.
Nevertheless, as a person's body mass index climbs above 25 or, more dangerously, past 30, his or her risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and various kinds of cancer -- breast, colon and endometrial -- rises.

Ms. Salas, like many others involved in plus-size gatherings, contends that society emphasizes weight too much.
People should be encouraged not to diet but to build strength and stamina, she said.
"Society has been fed that skinny is way of life," Ms. Salas said, "and it should be that healthy is a way of life."
Groups for the obese provide guidance on meeting challenges that lighter people may never think about.
For example, Ms. Salas advises the carrying of airplane seat-belt extenders to avoid the embarrassment of having to request one from a flight attendant.

The exercise comes as a bonus.
Many people who sign up for the classes, vacations, dances and parties say they are mostly drawn by the possibility of companionship.
"I'm a big guy in addition to being what they call a fat admirer," said Darren Battle, the creator of Big Boogie Nights, who is 5-foot-9 and 285 pounds.

"The ground rules that the board agreed upon have not been altered," Mr. Knight said in a brief interview yesterday about Mr. Mack's status.
"The process is working quicker than most people expected."
In the last week, a number of directors have come to believe that Mr. Mack is the one executive able to unite Morgan Stanley.
Of all the 13 members of Morgan Stanley's board, Mr. Knight arguably has the most in common with Mr. Purcell.

Mr. Purcell, by comparison, was a consultant for McKinsey in Chicago, who in 1978 joined Sears, Roebuck at 35 after completing a project on how the retailing giant should diversify into financial services.
In 1986, he became chief executive of the brokerage firm Dean Witter, having advised Sears to buy it in 1980.

Mr. Knight is best known for having kept alive what would become 43 consecutive years of earnings increases at Emerson Electric, which manufactures products including power tools, air-conditioners and electric motors.
Robust and direct, with a back-slapping way about him, Mr. Knight is publicity-shy, but in the boardroom, people who know him say that his presence is a large one.
Like many Morgan Stanley directors, Mr. Knight is a product of the clubby, insular world of the corporate boardroom.
Retired from Emerson, he has seats on prestigious boards -- SBC Communications, I.B.M.

He has also been a director at BP and Caterpillar.

Jacob, a communications executive at Anheuser-Busch.
While these men are respected figures, none have any significant operational experience in the securities industry, a gap in their résumés that became a focus of criticism by the eight dissident executives who called for Mr. Purcell's ouster.

SOUTH PARK CONSERVATIVES The Revolt Against Liberal Media Bias.
By Brian C. Anderson.
191 pp.
Regnery Publishing.
$24.95.
IN a well-known spoof of a typical talk-radio exchange, two callers debate a fatuous point.
The first says: "Right-thinking people in this country are sick and tired of being told that ordinary, decent people are fed up with this country being sick and tired.
I'm certainly not and I'm sick and tired of being told that I am."
The second caller retorts, "Well, I meet a lot of people, and I'm convinced that the vast majority of wrong-thinking people are right."
A conservative housewife, listening to the blather, snaps, "Liberal rubbish!"
and turns the dial.
It's a shining example of what, in a country with a less sophisticated sense of humor, might be called Monty Python Toryism.
In "South Park Conservatives: The Revolt Against Liberal Media Bias," Brian C. Anderson, an editor of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, charts the rise in respectability -- or, at least, of visibility and audibility -- of "proudly anti-elitist" right-wing thought in America's public dialogue over the last two decades, a development that was spearheaded by Rush Limbaugh in the late 1980's on talk radio and has since spread to other media in a process Anderson calls "FOXification."
To him, the popularity of the stingingly anti-P.C.
cartoon series "South Park" signals the advent of a new generation of Americans who refuse to accept public censure for their scornful attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, Native Americans, environmentalism and abortion rights.
In an effort not to gloat, he cloaks his descriptions of this triumph in the humble fleece of the common man (Limbaugh is, for example "a college dropout" who "had put himself through a rigorous self-education, mastering an array of issues") and champions talk radio as "the first media forum in which ordinary Joes can actually get a hearing for their complaints about what liberals have wrought in America since the 1960's."
The purpose of Anderson's book is subtle and -- in spite of its just-folks pretenses -- intellectual: claiming cultural territory for conservatives not by seizing it outright but by crawling gingerly across it, inch by inch, with his arm over his head, as if a liberal weenie might jump out and clobber him at any moment.
By all appearances, he wants to seem reasonable, and his book tries to maintain a tone of genial detachment.
But it also puts forward a deeply partisan argument: the American right is more reasonable than the American left and, what's more, conservatives are still being suppressed by liberal bullies.

What are the concrete abuses Anderson believes the left has perpetrated on the country's dittoheads -- given that a Republican president in his second term, backed by a Republican Congress, continues to prosecute a war that few on the left support?
Also, he writes, liberals call the conservative majority names: " 'Racist,' 'homophobe,' 'sexist,' 'mean-spirited,' 'insensitive' -- it has become an ugly habit of left-liberal political argument to dismiss conservative ideas as if they don't deserve a hearing."
As if that weren't bad enough, network television portrays businessmen unflatteringly, doesn't show enough black criminals on prime time and is overly tolerant of extramarital sex and homosexuality.

Anderson quotes an interview that Howard Kurtz, the Washington Post's media critic, conducted with Lawrence O'Donnell, a political analyst and screenwriter for "The West Wing," in which O'Donnell said, "You'll never, ever get the Republican TV show."
Anderson and O'Donnell imply that this has something to do with politics, but isn't it more likely a question of ratings?
Would anybody, even a conservative fan of "South Park" -- especially a conservative fan of "South Park" -- want to watch a sitcom about churchgoing parents with two children who lead an uneventful life and make regular donations to the Fraternal Order of Police?
Obviously, Anderson knows his audience: this book isn't intended for readers of The Times and The Economist and watchers of CNN.
It's for the people who are sick and tired of mainstream media and are fans of the blogs and right-wing commentators he cites so abundantly.
Still, like Rodney King, he professes to want us all to "get along," reminding us that "democracy requires a willingness to engage the arguments of those you disagree with, recognizing their equality as citizens."
Is this a process that reasonable liberals and reasonable conservatives can acknowledge?
Perhaps the argument clinic of the Monty Python Tories can light the way.
First speaker: "Argument is an intellectual process.
Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says."
Second speaker: "No it isn't."
Exactly.

But Mr. Greenspan and other senior officials are now suggesting that the change is more enduring.
The debate is over why the change has occurred, and different theories lead to sharply disparate conclusions about the best way to respond.
"My sense is that people think this could be the new reality, that this could be fundamental, that it could be long-lasting," said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm.
Mr. Greenspan, testifying before Congress earlier this month, described the trend as profoundly important and "clearly international in origin."

The term premium -- the added payment that investors demand to cover the uncertainty of holding long-term bonds -- has shrunk to almost nothing.
Investors appear to assume that the overnight rate will be about 3.75 percent by the end of this year.
But the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds remains about 4 percent.

One school of thought holds that low bond yields are a harbinger of slowing economic growth, which would reduce demand for credit in the future.
Another school holds that global investors have lower inflation expectations than in the past, which reduces the risk of holding long-term bonds.
If either theory is correct, the Federal Reserve would have less need to fend off inflation and could stop raising short-term rates at a much lower level than in the past -- perhaps below 4 percent.

But yet another theory holds that long-term interest rates may have been depressed by other factors, including a "savings glut" around the world and efforts by Asian central banks to keep the value of their currencies down by buying United States Treasury securities.
If that is true, the flood of foreign money into the country could be diluting the Fed's effort to prevent inflation.
That would imply that the Fed needs to raise rates more than many investors are expecting.
Mr. Greenspan, testifying before Congress on June 20, was skeptical about theories based on low inflation expectations or on an impending slowdown.
"A narrow gap between short- and long-term rates is often misread as though we're about to tilt into a recession," he said.
"If that is the case, then the hypothesis that it is a weak economy which has been driving down interest rates is probably not correct."

He also expressed concern that low long-term rates had contributed to "froth" and might be feeding inflationary pressures.
"And that's something which, needless to say, we are focusing on very extensively."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Other officials have been more optimistic.
William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, has argued several times that long-term rates are mostly driven by investors' expectations of long-term inflation.
Even though the Fed has raised short-term rates, Mr. Poole said in a speech on June 14, investors have had no reason over the last year to expect higher long-term inflation.
"Economic surprises have been minimal over the past year, and there has been no reason for significant revision in expected future short-term interest rates," Mr. Poole said.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, suggested on June 20 that there may be less uncertainty about inflation than in the past.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"It's important to keep in mind that the term premium shouldn't be expected to behave in the way it's behaved in postwar cycles in which inflation was unsteady," Mr. Lacker said.
"The most likely explanation for the low rates," he said, is that "inflation is low and that inflation expectations are low."
Wall Street economists are as divided as Fed officials about the proper interpretation.
James Glassman, a senior economist at J.P. Morgan, contends that long-term interest rates reflect the deflationary effects of globalization.
"If you think of this in economic terms, East Asia and Nafta have been annexed to the United States.
It looks like an economy that has far more excess capacity.
Overnight, decisions by the Chinese government are releasing huge numbers of Chinese laborers.
That means more excess capacity and a longer time to get back to full employment."
By that interpretation, the Fed could stop raising short-term rates once they reach 3.75 percent.
But others predict that the Fed will continue to worry about inflationary pressures, the United States' soaring level of foreign indebtedness and the dangers of a housing bubble.

Mr. Greenspan, asked by lawmakers to specify a "neutral" Fed funds rate -- one that would try to neither speed nor slow the economy -- has periodically remarked that people would know it when they saw it.
But in his most recent testimony, he added a twist: people would know it because "we will observe a certain degree of balance which we have not seen before" in the economy.

The resulting bilateral corporate tango -- in contrast to the confrontations reminiscent of the 1980's and early 1990's when Japanese capital poured into the United States -- means that China has many American corporate comrades, who have a stake in helping generate its growth.
China, economists and Asia experts say, does not face some of the inherent limitations that ultimately stymied Japan and led to economic stagnation there over the last 14 years.
With its giant population, China is developing a large and diverse economy, creating an almost Darwinian competition for a domestic market that has extremely low-cost companies ready to export inexpensive goods around the globe.
"The economy is much more flexible, adaptable than Japan's," said Liang Hong, an economist in Hong Kong for Goldman Sachs.

The bid by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Unocal has raised worries among some politicians in Washington.

More disconcerting to others in Washington is China's growing ability to finance any political and military ambitions.
China has missiles with nuclear weapons that intelligence experts describe as already able to hit not just Hawaii but probably California.
Beijing also remains chilly toward American entreaties to put more pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
So far, China has put off Bush administration demands to let its yuan appreciate.
But China's economic rise also faces many obstacles.
Its banks have huge portfolios of nonperforming loans that have not yet become a crippling problem because of rapid growth, but that could, as in Japan, make a recession someday even harder to combat.

They are unlikely to go to the doctor very often and when they do, doctors here charge less than $5 for an office visit and administering a few stitches.

At a long hall in downtown Guangzhou, it quickly becomes apparent why the Honda workers are young and the pay is low.
Rows of young men and women sit in plastic chairs watching two huge television screens covered with Chinese characters and numbers.
While it resembles an off-track betting parlor in Hong Kong, 100 miles down the Pearl River, this is really the city's main government-run employment center.

Some of the employers are hiring dozens of workers at a time, but one of the columns on each screen shows a requirement that would be illegal to list in the United States: the age range for acceptable applicants, most often 20 to 35.
The official average unemployment rate in China's cities is 4.2 percent.
But that excludes China's vast army of rural adults with little or no work to do, an army estimated as high as 150 million people.
Millions move to the cities each year, an immense migration that slowed increases in Chinese industrial wages until the last year or two, when the Chinese economy has grown so rapidly that employers have begun bidding up workers' wages anyway.

The plight of these migrants seems to be improving, and as it improves they may become even more attractive job applicants for multinationals looking for workers.

One question is how China can retain the political stability it has shown for most of the last three decades while moving toward more democratic processes that the Communist Party has long claimed as its goal.

Gathered in a junior high school classroom were 45 representatives elected by 5,400 neighborhood residents.
Liu Yonghong, the director of the council and a Communist Party member, was re-elected, 44 to 1, defeating a nonparty member.

"If we have stability," said Li Weijie, the director general of the municipal bureau of civil affairs, "we can have successful development."
"I made the decision because a retired service member working as a salesman presented this, and he was using referrals from other service members."
The bill would also take aim at high-cost lenders who offer military personnel quick, short-term "payday" loans with annual interest rates that can approach 1,000 percent.
Specifically, a provision drafted by Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, would prevent payday lenders from threatening to contact a military borrower's commanding officer or using symbols or language that suggest the Department of Defense or any federal entity endorses the lender.

One company under examination, Madison National Life Insurance, based in Middleton, Wis., recently became the second military insurer to offer full cash refunds to service members.
A second company, American Amicable Life Insurance of Waco, Tex., has already offered refunds to about 900 military customers under an agreement reached with Mr. Oxendine's office last fall.
The Defense Department's own efforts to address life insurance sales on military bases are ready to move forward, officials there said.
That comment period ended last week, clearing the way for the rules to be officially adopted; however, earlier legislative restrictions prevent the rules from becoming effective until 90 days after the G.A.O.

"The one thing that made our partnership an easy choice is the convenience and reach of Bank of America," Bruce L. Hammonds, MBNA's chief executive, said in announcing the deal in New York yesterday.
"Being part of Bank of America gets us to where we need to be overnight."
Under the deal, Mr. Hammonds will become the head of Bank of America's credit card operations.
It will mean a very rich payday: he could receive some $154.5 million even before he starts, according to Brian Foley, an executive-compensation consultant in White Plains.
Mr. Hammonds can expect about $19.5 million in severance pay, assuming that the deal prompts a change-in-control agreement with MBNA, based in Wilmington, Del.

The merger will also free up about $110 million in stock options and restricted stock, Mr. Foley said.

An MBNA spokesman did not return calls seeking comment yesterday.
For its part, Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., is acquiring a portfolio made up of the lowest-risk borrowers in the industry.

"We think these strategies complement each other," Bank of America's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, said in New York.

Another worry for Bank of America involves an estimated $15 billion in credit card loans that MBNA carries for rival banks, including Wachovia.

But by eliminating 6,000 jobs and otherwise reducing costs, Bank of America estimates that the acquisition will begin adding to its bottom line in 2007.
The bank said it would take a $1.3 billion charge after taxes as a result of the acquisition.
The deal comes at a time of consolidation in the industry and may herald the end of the stand-alone credit card company.
In early June, Washington Mutual said it would pay $6.45 billion for the credit card company Providian Financial.
With yesterday's announcement, the 10 largest card issuers control about 87 percent of the market, according to The Nilson Report, a card industry newsletter.

Until the merger is completed late this year, cardholders will notice no changes to their accounts.
Even then, it is unclear just what Bank of America, a major issuer of Visa cards, will do with MBNA's MasterCard and American Express accounts.
"We do not know yet when the new cards will be issued," a Bank of America spokesman, Peter McKillop, said.
Some consumer advocates worry that having fewer issuers could eventually hurt customers.
"Competition has kept the industry in check and has really driven these zero percent and low interest rate offers," said Curtis Arnold, founder of CardRatings.com, an information Web site for consumers.
"Competition is really going to be stifled when you put two of the largest issuers together.
I can't see how it can be a positive for consumers."

The remaining big card companies, Capital One and Discover, which Morgan Stanley is evaluating for a possible spinoff, are likely targets for banks seeking to expand credit card businesses.
Some analysts now suggest that Capital One, and possibly American Express, could be next on the auction block.
"The boardrooms at Capital One and American Express have to be humming to figure out how they fit into the new landscape," said David Hendler, a senior analyst with CreditSights, a securities research firm in New York.
"If you are never going to make it to the size of the elite guys, then you are really a target."
The offer of $27.50 a share represented a fairly rich premium, about 30 percent, over MBNA's closing price on Wednesday.
MBNA stockholders will receive 0.5009 Bank of America share, valued around $23.375 each, as well as $4.125 a share in cash.

With the FleetBoston acquisition largely behind it, Bank of America has been looking for ways to grow.

That leaves Bank of America essentially three avenues for growth: It can acquire overseas financial institutions, it can buy an investment bank, or it can increase its credit card holdings.
Two weeks ago, it announced plans to extend its overseas reach by acquiring a 9 percent stake in China Construction Bank for $2.5 billion.
Yesterday's deal doubles the number of credit card accounts it holds and significantly increases its reliance on consumer lending.

And while the average price is affected by multimillion-dollar sales, another measure, the median price, also rose to record levels, showing the breadth of the increases.
Half of the apartments sold for less than the median price, and half sold for more.
There were many reports of sellers with multiple offers during the peak of the spring season, with sellers walking away with multiple backup offers and brokers talking about "frenzy", but that cooled somewhat in the last few weeks among more expensive apartments, as more apartments, including newly completed units, came on the market.

"This is a nonpartisan event about poverty and world debt, and we had no hesitation about that," Mr. Wilson said.
By any measure, the housing boom -- now almost four years old -- is one for the record books.
Together, those 55 markets now account for an unprecedented 40 percent of all housing value in the United States.
What makes this boom particularly unnerving is that it owes much of its longevity to the explosion in the number of risky mortgages.
Many borrowers are likely to be pinched, if not creamed, when interest rates rise or housing cools, leaving them unable to make payments, refinance on favorable terms or sell at a profit.
Lenders may be even more vulnerable than borrowers, which may mean an economywide disruption if -- or when -- housing prices stagnate or decline.
The traditional mortgage -- 20 percent down with a fixed interest rate -- is being eclipsed by loans with low down payments or none at all, many with adjustable interest rates.
These inherently risky mortgages are now routinely offered with features that allow a borrower to pay only the interest due for an extended period, or, even more dicey, with the "option" to pay less than the interest due each month while adding the unpaid portion to the loan balance.
One-fourth of all home buyers -- including 42 percent of first-time buyers -- made no down payment in 2004, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Nearly one-third of all new mortgages this year call for interest-only payments (in California, it's almost half), according to Loan Performance, a mortgage data firm.
Another risky aspect of these sorts of mortgages is that they attract relatively hard-pressed borrowers.
Egged on by lenders where mortgage-making has been the one consistent profit center, they tend to be people who can't afford a traditional fixed-rate loan -- even at the current low rates.

It's a safe bet that lenders wouldn't be so freewheeling if they had to worry about being paid back in full.
But it's unusual for lenders to bear the entire risk of the loans they make: they sell many mortgages to private investment banks, which slice and dice them into various securities -- an interest-only portion, say, and a principal-only portion.
Those securities are then sold to other investors, like mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, European insurance companies and the central bank of China, to name a few.
Investors now hold $4.6 trillion in mortgage-backed securities.
That's more than the outstanding value of United States Treasuries.

So far, the mortgage-backed market has generated cash and profits galore.
Someday, however, someone will lose money.
No one knows who, when or how much because housing has never been so frothy, risky mortgages so ubiquitous or the market in which they trade so vast.
Also unknowable is the quality of lenders' and investors' hedges, the complex investing strategies that are supposed to cover losses in the event of turmoil, like a default-inducing spike in interest rates.
Many of the players in this market are not subject to government regulation, and those that are haven't exactly been under the microscope.
The lack of transparency, meanwhile, is a growing risk in its own right.
Lenders and investors know they are interdependent, but they don't know which ones may be a weak link or which may be left holding the bag when economic conditions change.
Such uncertainty could make lenders skittish about giving mortgages to either good or bad borrowers.
"This is acting of the purest and most unostentatious kind, unadorned by self-pity or visible virtuosity," the critic John Peter wrote in The Sunday Times of London.

Sir Antony, 56, was speaking over lunch at a pub near the main theater of the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he has acted for more than two decades (his partner, Gregory Doran, is an associate director of the company).
Best known as a movie and stage actor, Sir Antony is also an artist and the author of four novels, a memoir and two theater journals.
He first read "If This Is a Man" in 1989, in preparation for a stage role, and began toying with the notion of bringing it to the stage.
"It's not a book you forget; reading it is not an experience you forget," Sir Antony said.
He used as a model the film "Shoah," with its technique of having present-day Holocaust survivors speak about long-ago experiences.

It took a lot of work, and a bit of luck, for Sir Antony to persuade the Levi estate to let him proceed with the project (Levi's heirs finally approved his script, but have stipulated that the play cannot be translated into other languages or performed by anyone other than Sir Antony).
The play is told almost entirely in Levi's own words, taken mostly from "If This Is a Man," with a small section from "The Truce," another Levi memoir.

The director, Richard Wilson, devised a set of grueling preparatory exercises, enlisting a group of actors to take part.
He continued: "It's important to say that again and again, because otherwise people get the impression of indulgent actors in a comfortable space claiming to touch the experience Primo Levi had.
But the important thing was the touching off of emotional recall, in myself, of times when I'd felt bullied, powerless, helpless, persecuted."
Sir Antony found performing "Primo," oddly, to be an antidote to stage fright.
"You couldn't bother with the usual actor's neuroses."

As it is, he said, he needs all his strength to revisit the same terrible story night after night.
"It's a question, inside oneself, of going to Auschwitz again and again and again," he said.
"Levi writes about it with such precision and detail.
It is as though he takes the reader by the hand and says, 'Come, I'm going to take you to hell now; I'm going to guide you to hell.'
And then he does."

Sir Antony's sense of Levi as a person is based in part on a television interview the author gave to the BBC in English in 1985, when he was promoting the English edition of his book "The Periodic Table."
"But he is surprisingly light-spirited and charming, and he has a twinkle -- and I just liked him."
But the ending was not the totality of the life, or of the man.
A clinical psychologist specializing in trauma, enlisted to discuss Levi with Sir Antony while he prepared for the play, pointed out that Levi carried on for 40 years -- working as a chemist, writing eloquently, starting a family -- after Auschwitz.
"Don't think of him as committing suicide," Sir Antony said the psychologist told him.
"Think of him as committing life."
From a small beginning a few years ago, the Western wedding "priest" has suddenly become an established part of modern Japan's cultural tableau.

"Now all the hotels have chapels with someone dressed up as a priest," said William J. Grimm, a Maryknoll priest who edits The Catholic Weekly of Japan.
In fact, the less overtly religious the pastor, the better.

"The companies like the nonreligious guy who just follows the script," said Mike Clark, a Japanese language student who performed weddings before moving home to Canada last fall.

"Of course, words are important, but in a ceremony it is more about the whole image," Masahiko Sakamoto, 25, said after watching Kenyon L. Nelson, a retired businessman from Missouri, perform a wedding at a hotel bridal fair.
"And a foreigner fits better into a Western wedding than a Japanese person would."
She added, "In soap operas you have more examples of white weddings than of Shinto ones."
Since 1996, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the number of Christian weddings has nearly doubled while the number of Shinto weddings has plunged by two-thirds.
Western weddings revolve around love and elevate the bride to a princess, Japanese say.
In a tradition-bound Shinto wedding, where the bride is encased in a wig and a kimono, the ceremony seems to be more about the merger of two families.

Only civil unions are legally valid here and with Japan's economy treading water, about 70 percent of all couples go on to have an optional religious ceremony.

Among foreigners, competition has depressed the pay for a wedding ceremony to $120, from $200 five years ago.
In a society that revolves around business cards, the card of one part-time "pastor" reads: "Max von Schuler Kobayashi: Performer, Actor, MC, Wedding Minister."

The Treasury Department began selling TIPS in 1997, designing them specifically to protect investors from inflation.
The Treasury adjusts the value of the bonds twice a year, based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.

So, over the life of the bonds, interest payments will rise and fall in line with the C.P.I.
At maturity, the Treasury pays bond holders either the inflation-adjusted principal or the original face value, whichever is greater.
But the prices fetched in trading on the open market are based more on investors' views on future inflation, rather than on historical data of the price index.
Bond prices move in the opposite direction of their interest rates, so if investors skittish about inflation were to bid up the cost of TIPS, the yields would fall.
That has been happening fairly steadily over the last three years.
That means investors expecting inflation to rise are willing to accept a lower interest rate now for higher rates later.

"We think the U.S. economy is going to weaken," said Mihir Worah, co-manager of the Pimco Real Return fund, which invests in TIPS.

"All of this outsourcing is going to put pressure on wages," he said, "and wages drive a lot of inflation."

TIPS are priced now as if inflation will average about 2.3 percent over the next 10 years.
That is the spread between the real yield on 10-year TIPS and the yield on equivalent Treasuries.
If annual inflation is lower than 2.4 percent, then Treasuries would be a better bet.

TIPS cannot be a perfect shield against all kinds of inflation, partly because their adjustments are based on the C.P.I., said Kenneth Volpert, co-manager of the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund.
Say an investor is buying TIPS in an account that is intended to pay for a college education, or to cover medical expenses during retirement.
The inflation on those big expenses may be very different than it is for a tube of toothpaste or a tank of gas.
"It seems like the cost of education is always growing faster than the C.P.I.," Mr. Volpert said.
The Pimco and Vanguard funds are two that Mr. Jacobson recommends.
He described the Vanguard TIPS fund as "more plain vanilla," and good for investors who prefer index funds.
The Pimco Real Return fund is anything but plain vanilla.
"Pimco is a master at uncovering relatively small inefficiencies in bond prices," Mr. Jacobson said.
"It may not seem like a lot when you're talking about 0.2 percent.
But if you find a few of those over a long period of time, it adds up."

THE total annual expenses of the Pimco fund are 0.9 percent, versus 0.17 percent for the Vanguard index fund.
"One way of looking at that is that Pimco has to make at least 0.73 percent each year just to get even with the other guy," Mr. Jacobson said.
"In the bond world, that's quite a battle."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Pimco fund had a total return of 2.9 percent in the second quarter, the same result as the Vanguard fund.
The Vanguard fund has no load, or sales charge.
The Pimco fund's Class A shares -- bought through an adviser -- have a 3 percent front-end load, while Class B and Class C shares come without a load but have higher expenses.
Mr. Jacobson said that do-it-yourself investors should buy the Pimco fund's Class D shares through their brokerage account.
These come without a load and have the same annual expenses as the Class A shares.
Whichever fund they choose, investors should make TIPS a small part of their portfolios, perhaps 5 percent, Mr. Jacobson advised.
"They're not a screaming buy today," he said.
At current prices, he said, investors who are considering TIPS for their portfolios may want to use dollar-cost averaging.

Above all, he warns against piling into TIPS just because of their strong recent performance.
"Many investors think TIPS are safer, but TIPS could fall sharply in the short term," he said.
"The professional investor is much more agnostic about which types of bonds he owns, based on price."
"We are confident that legal challenges to our plan will be dismissed."

While companies wait for that, they have been urging Congress to enact legislation to clarify the legal status of the many cash-balance pension plans now in existence.
Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, has introduced legislation addressing the legality of cash-balance pensions as part of a broader bill to revise the rules companies must follow in contributing to their pension plans.

Wearaway can occur when employees are switched from the old plan to the new one.
In a traditional, defined-benefit pension plan, the benefits are calculated according to a formula that typically multiplies each worker's pay and years of service by some factor.
The more years worked, and the greater the pay, the larger the pension the employee will receive.
In this system, workers build up their benefits fastest in their final years at a company.

In a cash-balance plan, a worker earns benefits expressed as a balance in a hypothetical individual account, which grows every year according to a predetermined interest rate.
Companies say many workers prefer this, because they can see at a glance how much of a benefit they have earned each year, rather than having to plug their salary and years of service into a formula and perform calculations.

Younger workers lose this high-earning phase as well, but for them it does not matter because they are likely to have more years in the new plan, and thus will have the chance to offset the loss of the late-career pension increases.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
This difference in the way older and younger workers fare in a conversion is the source of the age-discrimination claims.
The wearaway effect makes the discrepancy even greater.
Wearaway happens in cases where some employees -- usually people in their 40's and 50's -- have already earned bigger benefits under the old plan than they would have earned, in theory, if the new plan had been in place throughout their careers.
The employer stops their accruals for several years, until the theoretical amount they would have earned catches up with the amount they actually did earn.
This period of zero accruals is called wearaway.
Worker advocates -- including members of Congress -- say wearaway is discriminatory because it leaves the older group of workers earning no new pension benefits at all while the younger ones continue to build up their benefits at the rate determined by the pension plan.
Employees at other companies, including AT&T, Cigna and El Paso, have filed age-discrimination complaints about wearaway.
So far, no suit has resulted in a judicial ruling one way or the other.
In Congress, however, bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate that would make wearaway illegal.

At Southern California Gas, officials tried to soften the effect of the pension conversion on the oldest workers by delaying the wearaway period for five years.
Ms. Selesky said in the complaint that an online benefits calculator provided by Southern California Gas showed that her pension would remain frozen until at least 2009, even though her younger colleagues would continue to build up their benefits during that time.
The benefit calculator told him that he could not expect to resume benefit accruals until 2015.

Some sophisticated investors are sending strong signals that prices cannot rise much higher.
Among the big sellers that have been shedding billions of dollars worth of office and retail property in recent months have been Calpers, the nation's largest pension fund; Equity Office Properties, the giant real estate investment trust; and many private landlords like the Shorenstein family of San Francisco.

To Jim Titus, the managing director of Realpoint, the research arm of GMAC Institutional Advisors, today's prices are reminiscent of the late 1980's, when Japanese investors overpaid for trophy buildings and went on to suffer huge losses.
Commercial real estate is awash with capital, and many buyers are accepting initial returns of 5 percent or even less because they have few investment alternatives.
Once interest rates rise and investors can buy 10-year Treasury bills with a 5 percent yield, real estate will seem less attractive, Mr. Titus said.
"That can have a real impact on valuations in the marketplace."
Lloyd Lynford, the president of Reis Inc., a New York research firm, agreed that some buyers are overpaying on the assumption that empty space will fill up and rental income will improve.
But the leasing market has been highly volatile in recent years, reflecting the zigzag pattern of job growth, Mr. Lynford said.

Nationally, the average office vacancy rate dropped half a percentage point from the first quarter this year to the end of June, from 15.9 percent to 15.4 percent, but in many cases, Mr. Lynford said, "the cash flow has been deteriorating," because rents are not improving.

The volume of outstanding commercial mortgages has been growing and the total is now equivalent to 14.4 percent of gross domestic product, a level not seen since the days before the real estate crash of the early 1990's, according to Moody's Investors Service.
As with residential real estate, the proportion of interest-only loans has risen sharply.
But other real estate specialists say there is no cause for alarm, especially if interest rates rise only gradually.
Some say that the rich prices that office buildings are commanding still fall below the cost of replacing them.

Also cautioning against talk of a bubble is Green Street Advisors, a research company that specializes in REIT's.
Green Street calculates that the value of property owned by real estate investment trusts has risen 27 percent since 2000, while home prices have shot up 51 percent.
This suggests, the company said in a recent report, that "homes have a much worse case of bubblitis than commercial real estate."

Others draw a sharp distinction between the real estate market of 15 years ago and today's.
Dale Anne Reiss, who directs the real estate practice at Ernst & Young, points out that in the past, a landlord defaulting on a mortgage was often required to dispose of all other properties to pay off the lender, "creating a huge domino effect."
Such so-called recourse loans are rare today.
Another difference is that 15 years ago, most financing came from banks and savings and loans.
Today, by contrast, real estate financing has become highly complex, with many types of lenders assuming different levels of risk.

Calpers is not getting out of the real estate market either, but it is reducing its exposure to prime real estate and is buying more property abroad, said Michael B. McCook, the pension fund's senior investment officer in real estate.

"And if you're not a buyer, then you've got to be a seller."
Even those who are optimistic about the commercial real estate market in general are worried about the frantic pace of condo construction in places like South Florida and Las Vegas, where a high proportion of the buyers are investors.
Raymond G. Torto, the managing director of Torto Wheaton Research, a company owned by CB Richard Ellis, said that the commercial real estate market may have some rough spots but is in no danger of a collapse.

At the Federal Reserve, officials face issues similar to those posed by the stock market bubble of the late 1990's.
Today, Mr. Greenspan acknowledges that housing prices in some areas are "frothy," but he and other top regulators do not think it is their job to push them back down.
The main issue for regulators is whether banks and other lenders are properly managing their own risk, and the lenders are looking good.

They have hedged their risks by bundling mortgages into securities that are then sold to investors around the world.
And if interest rates go higher, they have shifted much of the risk onto consumers because a growing share of home buyers have taken on adjustable-rate mortgages.
At the same time, they have built sturdier financial institutions through mergers and the breakdown of barriers to interstate banking.

Bert Ely, an independent banking analyst who was among the first to recognize the crisis at savings and loan institutions in the 1980's, said the banks are far sounder today.

But consumers -- and perhaps the broader economy -- are taking on more risk.
If a mortgage rate jumps from 4 percent to 6 percent, just slightly above current levels, the monthly payment can jump by roughly 30 percent when the teaser rates come to an end.
The jolt can be higher for people with interest-only loans.
In addition to facing higher rates, borrowers also have to start paying down the amount they owe after about five years.
People who put no money down face a different risk: if housing prices decline, even slightly, owners who need to sell their homes may have to come up with thousands of dollars beyond the sale price to pay off their loans.
Indeed, because the main risks are to consumers rather than to financial institutions, some critics say regulators have been too timid.
"The prevailing attitude is that if you're taking on a risky mortgage, you're an adult and you're taking on the risk yourself," said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and a co-sponsor of a bill that would impose tougher rules against so-called predatory lending practices.

Unconventional mortgages have soared in popularity in recent years.
About a third of home buyers in the last 18 months did not put any money down, according to a recent survey of home purchasers by the National Association of Realtors.
Over 25 percent of all new mortgages in the last year have been interest-only loans, which allow buyers to postpone principal payments for three to five years but which become much more expensive afterward.

Perhaps the hottest new loan is the so-called option adjustable-rate mortgage, or option ARM, which gives borrowers the choice of paying interest and principal, interest only, or even less than the normal interest.
If the home buyer picks the lowest possible payment, the mortgage debt goes up rather than down.

Despite their hands-off approach, some regulators are worried that banks and other mortgage lenders may not have properly judged the risks to themselves.
They warn that speculative buying has increased, with many people hoping to quickly resell houses and condominiums before the construction is even finished.
"There is a lot of pressure on banks to build market share, and consumers are looking for a quick response," said Barbara J. Grunkemeyer, deputy comptroller for credit risk at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
"With respect to these new mortgage products, they are new and have taken off rapidly.
We are still in the process of understanding the risk-management systems that surround them."

Led by the comptroller's office, which oversees nationally chartered banks, federal banking regulators published guidance in May that gave lenders more detailed instructions on how to evaluate the risks in home-equity loans.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The move was a warning shot to lenders.
The value of home-equity loans shot up 40 percent in 2004, to $398 billion.
Regulators say they plan to raise many of the same concerns this fall that they have already raised about home-equity loans.
The areas they find worrisome include granting loans equal to 100 percent of the value of the homes; granting large loans without due attention to the likelihood of higher monthly payments in the future; and granting "no-doc" (no documentation) or "low-doc" loans that require little or no proof of income or assets.

Such "guidance" is part of a joint effort by the federal regulators involved with banks and savings and loans: the Office of the Comptroller, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration.

Ms. Grunkemeyer said she would push for better assessment of a potential buyer's capacity to repay a loan.
Even if the applicant qualifies for a loan based on a teaser rate of 4.25 percent, for example, banks will be asked to judge whether that borrower will be able to make payments if the rate jumped to 6 percent.
Regulators also want to take a tougher stance toward no-documentation loans.
"You have to ask yourself, why would he be willing to pay a quarter-percent more when he could have gotten a lower rate by giving a copy of his pay stub and a W-2 form," Ms. Grunkemeyer said.
"There's a reason they've been called 'liar's loans."'

The guidance is tougher than it sounds, because bank examiners use it when they scrutinize an institution's loan portfolio and underwriting practices.
But even advocates of stricter scrutiny, like Susan Bies, a governor of the Federal Reserve, say regulators are merely telling banks what most of them already know.
"We're not trying to set off alarms that we see broad issues," Ms. Bies said in a recent interview.
"We are seeing examples of practices that need to be tightened down a bit."

Most regulators, including Mr. Smith in North Carolina, are against issuing edicts against particular kinds of loans, even relatively risky ones, if both home buyers and lenders are eager to have them.

But many state regulators want to go further than the federal government.
State banking regulators are locked in a long-running power struggle with Washington over so-called predatory lending: deceptive mortgage loans that have extremely high fees and are usually offered to people with poor credit.
Complaints about predatory lending are heavily concentrated among subprime borrowers, or people with spotty credit records and erratic incomes who probably could not have obtained a mortgage 10 years ago.

The volume of subprime mortgages has soared from about $35 billion in 1994 to about $530 billion in 2004 -- more than 20 percent of all new mortgages last year.
The foreclosure rate on subprime mortgages remains modest, only 3.5 percent in the first quarter of 2005, but that is nine times the rate for prime borrowers.
The Bush administration and Republican lawmakers in Congress are seeking to pre-empt state laws on predatory lending, saying that consumers and lenders need a coherent set of national rules.
But many states, including New York and North Carolina, contend that the federal guidelines are weaker than their own and that federal agencies are not equipped to handle consumer complaints from 50 states.

"I think I'll eventually get there," he said, smiling -- perhaps in the knowledge that "Last Days" isn't exactly blockbuster material.
I suggest that even though he used the same script, staging and camera angles as the Alfred Hitchcock original, what was missing was the underlying directorial "gaze."
Mr. Van Sant, a gay man whose work seems most alive when he's devising shots on the fly and letting his actors improvise, has an entirely different psychology.
Mr. Van Sant couldn't have agreed more.
"You can't copy a film," he said.

Even if it's in the same place, it will magically take on his character.
Our 'Psycho' showed that you can't really appropriate.

"I have this new theory about films.
Not because of the planets.
It's that sometimes you start with the wrong balance and the whole thing gets messed up."

The surge in air travel to levels like those before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, is an obvious explanation for the overcrowding, with 200 million people expected to board planes this summer -- the most in five years.
But more is at work than that.
Randy Petersen, a travel loyalty program specialist, says the rise of airline alliances and marketing agreements like the Star Alliance, One World or Sky Team, which grant elite members of frequent-flier programs admission to the global networks of airport lounges operated by other airlines, has contributed to the overcrowding.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Petersen estimates that 600,000 American travelers are members of United States airlines' clubs or lounges, paying for membership in either dollars or miles.
But with so many people having access to lounges, overcrowding is likely, Mr. Petersen said.
Changes in travelers' habits since 9/11 add to the overcrowding.
"You've got luggage all over the place because people are carrying on their luggage," Mr. Petersen said.
And the lounges have become an office on the go.
Many offer free Wi-Fi, so traffic has increased."
Some frequent fliers say the service in the lounges has gotten worse.
"There's no food, or it's lousy if there's any at all," said Ed Rose, chief executive of Open Channel Solutions, a Norwood, Mass., software company and a member of United's Red Carpet Clubs.
"And they forbid you to bring it in."

Then there is Priority Pass, started 13 years ago by a British company that gives people willing to pay an annual fee of up to $399 entree to 470 airport lounges worldwide, including 100 in the United States.
The program has 1.5 million participants, including 12,000 in this country.
Six United States airlines -- Delta, Continental, Northwest, United, USAirways and America West -- offer Priority Pass members at least limited access to their lounges.
To generate revenue, many airlines sell one-day passes priced from $20 that allow admission to their lounges, too.

Some travelers are so fed up with the crowding and other inconveniences that they are heading for the exits.
Patrick Hurley, a director of technology for Thomson Global Services who lives in Zug, Switzerland, says he dropped his seven-year- membership in USAirways' clubs five months ago.
It's just as crowded and noisy as the rest of the airport, you don't have peace and you don't feel special."

Some travelers also praise the friendly service they receive in lounges.
Still, the future of frequent-flier lounges is dim, says Mr. Petersen, despite construction of elaborate lounges by American at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and elsewhere and by Continental at Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston.

Since 9/11, some carriers have closed lounges at domestic airports where they have had to cut back or eliminate service.
"There's probably no solution to the crowding," Mr. Petersen said.
"For the last four to five years, the airlines haven't put a lot of money into expanding the lounges."

When travelers discover overcrowded lounges, Mr. Petersen suggests checking out lounges or clubs operated by other carriers with reciprocal deals on use by club members, like the one involving United and USAirways.
"United's lounges are often crowded, but there is often hardly anyone in the USAirways club," he said.
For a long time, it ignored China's undervalued currency so China could sell us lots of cheap stuff and would continue holding our devaluing dollars and helping to keep U.S. interest rates low.
Their holding our depreciating dollars helped you buy a house with no money down.
We've been in symbiotic relationships like this before with Western Europe and Japan during the cold war, but they were allies and democracies, so we could adjust imbalances more easily.
Not so with China.

We are Siamese twins, but most unlikely ones -- joined at the hip, but not identical.
That's a problem.
Because we now need to adjust the Tiananmen-Texas bargain.
So many U.S. dollars and jobs are flowing to China, it is becoming politically and economically unsustainable for the Bush team.
Hedge funds have made huge speculative bets around the T-T bargain.
We need China to revalue its currency upward against the dollar, so China buys more stuff from us and we buy less stuff from China.

But China's foreign exchange reserves today are nearly $750 billion and heading for $1 trillion -- most in U.S. Treasury notes.
If China is compelled by the U.S. to revalue its currency, and effectively devalue the dollar further, Beijing will take a big hit on all of its dollar reserves -- especially since most experts say the dollar has to be devalued by 30 to 40 percent against the Chinese currency to have any impact on the trade balance.
That would also be likely to affect the dollar's value against other currencies and create pressure for inflation and higher interest rates in the U.S.
"If the dollar falls and U.S. interest rates rise, it could cause a recession or stagflation in America," Professor Weber said.
"But if the Chinese currency rises too far too fast and triggers unemployment, it could cause a revolution against the Communist Party.
We might see our dollar policy as a market adjustment, but they could see it as an attempt at regime change."
As I said, the issue is not Unocal.
The real issue is that we have slipped into a symbiotic relationship with another major power that is neither a free market nor a democracy.
We have both grown dependent on that relationship -- the U.S. for cheap goods and cheap mortgages, and China for high employment and regime stability.
We now have to adjust the bargain at the heart of that relationship.
Whether we can do that delicately, without destabilizing Beijing or the global economy, could be the big geopolitical story of 2005.

He expressed unease about rising labor costs and slowing growth in productivity, and his message seemed to be that the economy is strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs.
Fulfilling the benign forecast for "reasonably good" economic growth and low inflation, he said without qualifications, "will require the Federal Reserve to continue to remove monetary accommodation."
That, along with a repeat of the Fed's long-standing goal of raising rates at a "measured" pace, means that the central bank is likely to raise rates by quarter-point increments from 3.25 percent today to about 4 percent by the end of the year.

Even though inflation has been unexpectedly low over the last two months -- the consumer price index was flat in May and June -- the Fed chairman expressed unease about rising labor costs and slowing growth in productivity.
"Those costs have turned up of late, and whether the favorable trends of the past few years will be maintained is unclear," he told members of the House Financial Services Committee.

Fed officials view labor costs as the most important source of inflation, both because labor costs amount to more than two-thirds of total costs and because they can feed a self-perpetuating spiral of higher prices and higher wage demands.
"Strong gains in efficiency have buoyed real incomes and restrained inflation," he said.
"But experience suggests that such rapid advances are unlikely to be maintained in an economy that has reached the cutting edge of technology."
In many ways, the Fed's stance is the mirror image of its stance two years ago.

"But such was not the case, and we must face the reality that more rate hikes are coming."

The "central tendency" of forecasts by the Fed's 12 regional banks was for growth to average 3.5 percent this year and next, rather than the 3.75 percent predicted in February.
The prediction called for the rate of core inflation, excluding the price of food and energy, to be just under 2 percent.
That outlook for inflation is within the Fed's unofficial comfort zone, but it assumes that the central bank will continue to increase the cost of borrowing.

One reason that the Fed continues to push higher is that long-term interest rates and mortgage rates, which the central bank does not directly control, remain so low that housing prices continue to soar at double-digit rates.
But more so than in the past, Mr. Greenspan warned that bond investors as well as homebuyers may have been lulled into a false sense of complacency that interest rates and inflation will remain low for years to come.

"History cautions that long periods of relative stability often engender unrealistic expectations of its permanence," he said.
And these unrealistic expectations, "may lead to financial excess and economic stress."

Mr. Greenspan refrained from using words like "irrational exuberance" or "conundrum" to describe investor behavior, but he made a direct link between complacency about long-term interest rates and the boom in housing prices.
"The U.S. economy has weathered such episodes before without experiencing significant declines in the national average of housing prices," he said.
"Nevertheless, we certainly cannot rule out declines in home prices, especially in local markets."
A decline in housing prices "would be accompanied by some economic stress," he said, but "the macroeconomic implications need not be substantial."

Mr. Greenspan remained sanguine about the nearly negligible rate of household savings, predicting that the savings rate will rise as soon as homeowners slow the pace at which they take out home equity loans.
This uphill flow isn't the result of private-sector decisions; it's the result of official policy.
To keep China's currency from rising, the Chinese government has been buying up huge quantities of dollars and investing the proceeds in U.S. bonds.

One way to grasp how weird this policy is would be to think about what a comparable policy would look like in the United States, scaled up to match the size of our economy.
It's as if last year the U.S. government invested $1 trillion of taxpayers' money in low-interest Japanese bonds, and this year looks set to invest an additional $1.5 trillion the same way.
Some economists think there is a deep rationale for this seemingly perverse policy.
I think it's something the Chinese government stumbled into as it tried to protect itself from the 1997-1998 crisis, and it is reluctant to change because the Chinese economy has been doing well.
That is, China's leaders don't want to mess with success.
But pressures against China's dollar purchases are building.
By keeping the yuan down, China is feeding a trade surplus that is creating a growing political backlash in America and Europe.
And China, which is still a poor country, is devoting a lot of resources to the accumulation of a basically useless pile of dollars instead of to higher living standards.

The question is what happens to us if the Chinese finally decide to stop acting so strangely.
An end to China's dollar-buying spree would lead to a sharp rise in the value of the yuan.
It would probably also lead to a sharp fall in the value of the dollar relative to other major currencies, like the yen and the euro, which the Chinese haven't been buying on the same scale.
This would help U.S. manufacturers by raising their competitors' costs.

But if the Chinese stopped buying all those U.S. bonds, interest rates would rise.
This would be bad news for housing -- maybe very bad news, if the interest rate rise burst the bubble.

In the long run, the economic effects of an end to China's dollar buying would even out.
America would have more industrial workers and fewer real estate agents, more jobs in Michigan and fewer in Florida, leaving the overall level of employment pretty much unaffected.

In the short run, some people would win, but others would lose.
And I suspect that the losers would greatly outnumber the winners.

Right now America is a superpower living on credit -- something I don't think has happened since Philip II ruled Spain.
What will happen to our stature if and when China takes away our credit card?

It is not that people who live here have any quarrel with black-footed ferrets.
Few have even seen one.
It is the animal that the ferrets eat that is the problem, its formal name -- Cynomys ludovicianus -- surfacing in a recent flurry of back-and-forth lawsuits and government reports: the cute and chubby and insatiable prairie dog.

As the area has been struck by drought, prairie dogs have scampered over property lines and occupied neighboring ranches, devouring the vegetation on acres where cattle graze.
Last fall, after a ban on killing prairie dogs was lifted, the federal Department of Agriculture poisoned 5,000 acres of the public lands in the Canata Basin.
Ranchers applauded, saying prairie dogs threaten their livelihood.
Conservationists, though, warned against further poisoning, saying it could mean another threat of extinction for the black-footed ferret.
A long-term solution was promised this year, and now, landowners and conservationists alike are waiting for that management plan from the federal Forest Service, expected as soon as next week.
Here, prairie dogs are derided as darlings of the tourists and city dwellers, who have been known to photograph them or to keep them as pets.
Nonlethal means of relocating them come and go, like flushing soapy water into their holes -- sending the sudsy rodents scampering out -- and the so-called Dog-Gone vacuum, invented by a Colorado man who saw a big, yellow truck sucking prairie dogs out of holes in a dream.

Charles Kruse, 46, pointed out a photo taken on his property in the tiny nearby town of Interior last year, showing men on a grassless patch of gray prairie-dog mounds.

"It just makes you want to throw up," Mr. Kruse said.
"I care about endangered species, too, but we've got to have some common sense.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"I like ferrets, but I like people, too," he continued.
"It'd be like a bunch of cowboys coming to New York and saying, 'Let's save the rats."'
Mr. Kruse, a father of five, said he lost 70 percent of his combined cattle, wheat and hay business last year, and he and a few dozen other ranchers have sued and lobbied the state and federal governments to resume poisoning and recreational shooting of prairie dogs.
The Forest Service's plan is expected to spell out whether poisoning will be allowed, whether nonlethal plans will be ordered or some combination of the two.
Appeals are practically a certainty.
"If we don't maintain this critical habitat, the ferret will not survive," said Jonathan Proctor, 37, with the group Defenders of Wildlife.
"And if we can't do it here, we can't do it anywhere."

Every ferret in the country today can trace its lineage to one of seven original ferrets breeding in 1988.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The ferrets were reintroduced to the wild in the Canata Basin beginning in 1994.
They live in prairie dog towns, hiding in the maze of tunnels underground during the day and eating its sleeping inhabitants by night, living this way for about two years before they die, usually killed by a coyote.
The basin has the only self-sustaining ferret population today.
The ferret has become something of a mascot of the Endangered Species Act, a creature very nearly blinked out of existence.
"The bottom line, from a biological standpoint, is we have to have sufficient space or habitats for ferrets to occupy," said Mike Lockhart, 54, the black-footed ferret recovery coordinator with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service.
"Even though it's the best, it's still very small, and it's still very vulnerable."

Prairie dogs, meanwhile, have enjoyed a population explosion here, for reasons more complex than simply the benign hand of government programs.
In the 1990's, years of rainfall brought more grass, keeping the rodents fed without making them travel.
The years since 2000 have mostly been dry, and prairie dog towns have rapidly expanded over the landscape in search of food.
"Those prairie dogs start eating themselves out of house and home," Mr.

Suddenly, they seemed to be everywhere: Prairie dogs standing lookout over the mounds, at attention on hind legs, emitting a squeaky bark at the first sign of trouble.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In 2004, the government began poisoning the prairie dogs, with ranchers and workers first laying out oats near the mounds, then substituting them with oats laced with zinc phosphide, which reacts with stomach acid to produce toxic gases.
The mounds disappeared from Mr. Kruse's property, but he is not taking any chances on their returning, and has remained active with his neighbors under the umbrella name Nuisance Abatement Group.
He is in favor of a proposed one-mile-deep line of poison along where private property borders public lands, and for shooting prairie dogs, but he adds, "They're a lot harder to hit than you might think."
Mr. Proctor, with the conservation group, called recreational shooting "enraging" and believes the poisoning to be inhumane.
Besides, he said, neither are necessary: Prairie dogs cannot live in tall grass because their sentry-based alarm system will be useless.

To keep players out of trouble, Meyer relies on a layered system of discipline and academics inspired by John Wooden.
It is predicated on peer pressure, a strong investment of assistant coaches in players' lives and a reward system that allows Meyer to essentially spoil the players he likes.
"There's certain players that I love and there's other ones I can't stand," he said.
"If you're saying that's not true, you're not being honest.
I love the guys who go to class, I love the guys who live right and I love the guys who are great football players."

The Florida coaches even make academics competitive, breaking down the players into three categories: scarlet, red and gold.
The scarlet players are considered high risk and have all their classes checked.
The red players are watched closely.

But recently, more scientists have been asking whether something else may be involved.
They have discovered that there is a stem cell in bone marrow that can turn into fat or bone depending on what signals it receives.
In osteoporosis, bone cavities that everyone thought were just empty spaces are actually crammed with fat.
Patients with osteoporosis have more fat in their bones than people the same age who do not have the bone weakening disease.
And other factors that lead to bone loss -- steroids taken to suppress the immune system, bed rest, removal of a woman's ovaries -- also lead to an accumulation of fat in the bones, scientists have found.

"People started asking, Gee, is this really true?"
"Is there really a reciprocal relationship between bone and fat?"
In humans, studies using M.R.I.
scans are just beginning to examine how much fat people accumulate and whether it is related to the strength of their bones.
Instead of scattered autopsy results, the scanning studies can look at entire populations of different ages and can include people with osteoporosis and those free of it.
The results have been surprising, Dr. Rosen said.
That still leaves a question about the fat, Dr. Rosen says.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"What is it doing there?
We don't know," he said.
For now, cautions Dr. Gimble, while it is intriguing to think that the high levels of fat in bone may be as much a sign of bone weakness and deterioration as low bone density, that notion is still very much a hypothesis.
Other explanations include the possibility that the fat is needed to strengthen bone.

The marrow cells in question cling to narrow fibrous bands inside the bone.
The bone itself is a hard hollow shell.
So what goes inside the cavities formed by those interior fibers -- mostly empty space or some sort of filler to strengthen the bone?
"What makes a strong bone is not how much calcium it contains but what's in its center," Dr. Gimble said.
"If bone was hollow it would be more brittle.
You have to fill it with something."
Like fat.
Another possibility is that fat accumulates in bone for energy storage.
"There are reasons to say, yes, that's the case, and reasons to say it's not," Dr. Gimble added.

In the meantime, scientists are trying to find out what signals drive bone marrow cells along a pathway to become fat or bone.
They also are asking whether once cells turn into fat, it is possible to reverse the process and convert them to bone instead.

Laboratory studies took advantage of one basic fact about stem cells.
When they are growing in petri dishes they do not remain stem cells for long.
These immature cells quickly start to develop into whatever their genetic programs and the biochemical soup they are grown in directs them to become.

Another way to drive bone marrow stem cells to turn into fat in the laboratory is to activate a protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, or P.P.A.R.

The drugs are also known to make people gain weight, said Dr. Joan McGowan, director of the musculoskeletal diseases branch of the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.

It is not yet known whether the thiazolidinediones weaken the bones of diabetes patients, and researchers urge caution.

"These are very valuable drugs in treating diabetes," Dr. Gimble said.
"And what you see in an animal model is not necessarily what you see in patients.
You can't always make that kind of a jump."
As for whether fat can be converted to bone, the answer is that it can, but that may be just part of the story.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Dr. Gimble can do the conversion in the lab, taking fat from patients having liposuction.
When he adds a few chemicals, like vitamin D and dexamethasone, it turns into bone.
"We can see mineralization.
It looks like new bone formation," he said.

In other experiments, Dr. Gimble put human fat cells on a ceramic matrix that is used to promote bone repair in patients and then implanted the fat-coated ceramic under the skin of a mouse.
Dr. Frederick Kaplan of the University of Pennsylvania said that in humans there is also a rare genetic disorder that turns fat into bone.
The normal role for that gene, they learned, is to prevent fat from turning into bone.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Dr. Kaplan was astonished.
"The most amazing thing to me is that fat tissue has the capacity to form bone," he said.
And, in fact, that is what fat tissue wants to do, and will do unless it is stopped.
"It's not that you send a signal and say, 'I will tell you to form bone,"' Dr. Kaplan said.
"It's that you have to suppress a signal" to prevent fat from automatically turning to bone.
But, he said, it is not certain what this means for bone marrow fat.
He and Dr.
Shore are only beginning to look at the marrow of patients with the genetic disease.
And, he noted, not all fat is the same.
"Fat in marrow and fat in muscle may have completely different functions," he said.
"Fat under skin and in organs may be completely different."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Still, Dr. Gimble said he is intrigued by the idea that a genetic mutation, turning off a signal, turns fat to bone.
Maybe, he said, it will be possible to find drugs that act on bone marrow fat, turning it to bone.
The work with the patients with the genetic disease shows that "this sort of pathway is possible," he said.
"It might be something we can tap into and regulate."

There are 293 full-time umpires in professional baseball, a tiny fraternity (though it includes one woman, Ria Cortesio, who works in the Class AA Southern League).
They may be the only ones who appreciate the requirements of the job: not only an expertise in the arcana of the baseball rulebook, but the confidence and panache of a salesman, a Teflon ego and an almost religious respect for a level playing field.
It is natural to ask: Why do they do it?
Well, there is the magical pull of big-time baseball, for one thing.

"I want to get to the major leagues."

It is not a statistically likely outcome.
There are, after all, only 68 major league jobs, and they open up about as often as vacancies on the Supreme Court.
One major league umpire, Bruce Froemming, is in his 35th season.
All of which makes minor league umpires like Tiller, Macias and Larson competitors as well as allies.

But do not get personal.
"Anything preceded by the pronoun 'you' that doesn't have something positive attached to it is automatic," Macias said.

Some are better behind the plate; some on the bases, he said.
They all need to work on establishing control of a game.
"But that's why they're here," he said.
"They're trying to do what the players are trying to do, move up to the next level."
Class AA, in fact, is viewed as the make-it-or-break-it level of pro baseball, for umpires as well as for players.
It is the only level at which three-man umpiring crews are used.

Between Class A and Class AA, "the game becomes much, much faster," said Mike Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Professional Baseball Umpires Corporation, which is responsible for hiring, evaluating and promoting umpires in the minor leagues.

Tiller is a Texas farm boy, quick to smile and quick to acknowledge that his experience is largely that of a hick, which is why he dislikes the nickname that Kayser, the league president, has given him: Big Country.
Larson, from Idaho, has the kind of humility and formal politeness that comes across as almost military, but he has a disarming smile and a towel-snapping sense of humor.

To get to this point, the three had to attend one of two sanctioned umpire schools and then finish among the best students in an annual evaluation course run by the umpires corporation, which is known as P-BUC.
From then on, the future of an umpire depends on his ratings by P-BUC evaluators, who observe the umpires at work at various times during the season, usually arriving unannounced.
The umpires receive written evaluations twice a year, and they are excruciatingly explicit, which lets them know how closely they are being watched.
Tiller's read, in part: "You demonstrated good footwork on double plays by moving to an area where you can see the fielder's hands receiving the throw.
You are umpiring with a greater deal of confidence, compared to last year."

At the end of each season all the umpires at each of level of professional baseball are ranked, and the highest are moved up to the next level, depending on how many jobs are available.
This fall, he expects better results.
Macias and Larson are in their first Class AA season and expect to be back next year.

Given the size of the Knicks' Fantasy Island offer, reportedly between $50 million and $60 million, the entire episode, seen through the New York looking glass, had a reality-show quality to it, lacking only Donald Trump to inform Herb Williams, "You're, uh, not hired!"
Don't feel too sorry for Williams, whose fledgling coaching career might not have survived a first run with a team in the Knicks' transition state.
For years, young African-American coaches have been handed jobs in which the odds were stacked heavily against them.
At Brown's side, Williams will have the opportunity to learn from a man who makes teams better, with the possibility of succession, and without risking personal responsibility should, as Micheal Ray Richardson once said, "the ship be sinkin."'

"I would hope, in the near future, he'll be the head coach of the Knicks," Brown said of Williams.
Whether "near future" means two years or four, no one, maybe Brown least of all, is in position to say.
For now, Williams becomes part of the extended Brown coaching family.
And he joins the ongoing melodrama that Brown's long and fascinating career has been and will undoubtedly continue to be in his native city, in a building that has never had a basketball coach and soap opera star quite like Larry Brown.

His emotions will be worn on those well-starched sleeves because the best-dressed man in the house is far from being the prototypical corporate animal.
And that is why he has kept moving all these years, leaving behind organizational survivors, once he decided his coaching work was done.
He kept saying that he needed to rest, but there was Shelly Brown yesterday, saying: "You know what?
I don't know if he actually knows how to rest."
So Thomas called him to the microphone at half-past noon, and Larry Brown was officially the Knicks' 22nd coach, another former point guard and Hall of Famer given the chore of remaking Stephon Marbury and molding a basketball team out of the uneven and largely unaccomplished collection of talent assembled by Thomas.

"They have recently been burned."
Mr. Rhodes also said that despite the better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, "you are probably on the backside of the profits cycle," which means earnings growth will be slowing.
While the current 11.1 percent growth rate for the second quarter is better than expected, it would be well below the 21.8 percent average for the previous seven quarters.
And the projected growth rates for the third and fourth quarters, while higher than 11.1 percent, are also below the seven-quarter average.

That some economists are projecting stronger growth in the months ahead means that there is less of a chance for a pause by Fed policy makers.
This fear was reflected in the trading of federal funds futures yesterday, with the yield on the December contract jumping to 4.035 percent.
The jump, from 3.975 percent a week ago, means that a rising number of investors are betting there will be four more quarter-point rate increases this year.

Four pay phones sit on the corner of West 34th Street and 10th Avenue, two on the southeast corner and two on the northwest, and on a sultry afternoon last week a steady stream of callers fed them a steady stream of quarters.
By the looks of it, most of the callers were not aware of two other phones nearby, on the northeast corner, that do not strictly qualify as pay phones.
The phones are free for calls shorter than four minutes, part of a campaign by a small communications company called Popa Media Big Apple, which has installed 47 payless phones around the city.
The company makes money by selling snappy advertisements placed next to the phones that it hopes callers cannot help but notice.
The free phones have been on West 34th Street for about two months, next to a trash container at a BP gas station, but they have not rendered their change-accepting neighbors obsolete just yet.
"If they have a free phone, they shouldn't stick it over in the corner."
Indeed, traffic at the free phone and the pay phones was roughly equal, and Popa Media has a unique problem: New Yorkers' innate wariness of things that seem too good to be true.

The proposals are expected to include economic incentives intended to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear activities.

Some experts said the Iranian threat was largely symbolic because it related to producing uranium gas rather than taking the next step of enriching the gas to turn it into fuel for reactors or weapons.
Under international pressure, Iran suspended its nuclear programs in November 2004 but has frequently threatened to restart them, insisting that it has a sovereign right to do so.
The United States believes Iran wants to build nuclear weapons but Iran says its programs are for civilian purposes.
Since last November, Iran and the European Union -- represented by Britain, France and Germany -- have been negotiating over Iran's demands for an independent nuclear program.
The British statement said that if Iran resumed nuclear activities, it would be taking an "unnecessary and damaging" step that would make negotiations "very difficult to continue."
In that case, the statement said, the European Union would take the issue to the International Atomic Energy in Vienna.

The Uranium Conversion Facility turns uranium ore, known as yellowcake, into gas.
The gas can later be fed into centrifuges and enriched to be used as fuel in nuclear plants or, if highly enriched, in nuclear weapons.
Iran said operations at its nuclear site in Natanz, where the centrifuges are kept, would remain suspended.

The head of Iran's negotiating team, Hassan Rowhani, in a progress report on Sunday to President Mohammad Khatami, said he believed the Europeans were planning to delay offering their final proposal in order to see what the policies of the incoming president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, would be.
Mr. Ahmadinejad is scheduled to take office on Aug. 6.
"We do not want to do any work without the supervision of agency," Mr. Assefi said.
The agency's seals would be removed in the presence of the agency's inspectors, who are currently in Iran, he added.
Once the cameras are functioning, which will take about a week, Iran could resume activities and legally still be in compliance with its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, two senior I.A.E.A.

But if it did so, Iran would be breaking its voluntary agreement with the Europeans to indefinitely suspend such activities as long as negotiations continued.
In Iran on Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, rejected the Europeans' warning, vowing that his country would never abandon its "legitimate rights" to peaceful nuclear technology under international law.

The verbal battle is the latest -- and potentially most serious -- contest between Iran and the three European countries acting under the umbrella of the European Union.
If Iran carries out its threat to resume nuclear work, the Europeans, with the prodding of the Bush administration, will have no choice but to seek to have Iran punished in some way by the United Nations Security Council, even if only with a resolution of concern or disapproval.

"in the next few days" to decide what to do next about Iran's nuclear activities.
The Iranian threat may be part of a larger strategy to keep its options open as its new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, takes over on Wednesday, officials involved in the negotiations said.
Iran may be trying to wrest more concessions from the Europeans in exchange for continuing the suspension of uranium conversion and enrichment activities, as laid out in an agreement with the Europeans last November.
Or Iran may be gambling that it can restart its activities under 24-hour international inspection in order to split the international community and avoid any punishment.

But officials say that the proposal does not allow Iran to resume the uranium-related activities that it believes it is entitled to under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The treaty allows signers to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.
At the conversion plant in Isfahan, uranium ore known as yellowcake is turned into UF6, or uranium hexafluoride gas, which can later be fed into centrifuges to be enriched.
Enriched uranium can be used for peaceful energy purposes or in a bomb-making program.
Iran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes, a position that Mr. Asefi, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, reiterated.
He also told the IRNA news agency that the work "will be under the supervision of the U.N. nuclear agency."

On Washington Avenue in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, where chop shops and abandoned lots of rubble and weeds once stood alone, a concrete mixer rumbles daily in front of a new eight-story building, complete with a limestone facade.
"Development is a beautiful thing," said Gertrude Sowell, who mulled the housing rising around her from her stoop in the South Bronx, where she has lived for 45 years.
This new generation of homeowners has had a tremendous impact on the city's economy.
In the fiscal year ended July 1, New York City took in $2.2 billion in real estate transfer taxes, generated in large part from the sale of existing real estate but also from new homes.
Those taxes, as well as other revenue that comes with new construction, have been a key element of the city's recovery from a fiscal crisis.
While Manhattan's new buildings may get the ink, the real action is in the city's four other boroughs.

"Housing is being built where 20 years ago people would not live," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a telephone interview.
"Other cities in other states have just not enjoyed this kind of boom.
Each block is much more diverse than people realize.
There is a cooperation and a spirit that we are here together and we're going to live together."

In many cases, complaints about a lack of housing have been replaced with fears of overdevelopment.
Neighbors from Bay Ridge to Throgs Neck have flooded the Bloomberg administration with requests to limit the number of apartment buildings being built in their midst, saying that they intrude on the indigenous look of blocks, create overcrowded schools and subway stations and even lower water pressure.
And the Bloomberg administration has undertaken the largest rezoning program since 1961, prohibiting new apartment buildings on blocks where they look out of character and rezoning former manufacturing areas to allow for residential development.
"At the same time," she said, "we have to preserve our neighborhoods, because they are the city's crown jewels."
So far, 30 neighborhoods have been rezoned -- some "up," to accommodate new housing, and others "down" and many more areas will be similarly rezoned soon.

At the same time, people charge that developers are cutting corners on safety to get buildings up fast.

The index measures the ability of a family earning the median income to buy a home at the median price, using conservative financing and a 20 percent down payment.
In the same period, existing home sales hit a record.
What gives?
For starters, even with purchasing power on the wane, the typical family can still afford the typical home, though not as comfortably as before.
The Realtors' index put the median family income in the second quarter of 2005 at $56,917 nationally, which is considered adequate to cover a house costing $251,900, according to the group's calculations.
The median price for an existing home was $208,500.
That doesn't mean much in a hot market like California's, where the median price is $530,430.
And first-time home buyers around the country are being priced out, with renters failing by a widening margin to reach the income level at which they would qualify for a mortgage on a typically priced home.
The fact that the home-buying spree continues is due mainly to incredibly easy mortgage money.
More than 4 out of 10 first-time home buyers are putting no money down, and hot markets are rife with mortgages that allow buyers to make interest-only payments early on.
It's precisely that sort of what-me-worry activity that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is seeking to quell with his steady interest rate increases.
So far, prices have continued to rise along with rising rates, leading to that affordability crunch.
But sooner or later, the rate increases will kick in, and the market will cool.
The adjustment could be orderly or disorderly, with collapses in some areas.
Even a soft landing, however, would probably have a big impact on employment and consumer spending.
For policy makers and consumers, the better part of prudence would be to assume that rising unaffordability was an early warning sign that the market was nearing a top.
A group of eight national banks and the comptroller have filed separate lawsuits contending that federally regulated banks cannot be compelled to honor a state attorney general's request because it does not have primary oversight.

Koranic law forbids paying or receiving interest, or riba.
Over the last few years, several Islamic-friendly lending programs have popped up across the region to help solve the problem.
They offer creative loans that skirt the laws against riba by creating joint-owner partnerships or charging lease fees in place of interest.
The difference may seem largely semantic, but the loans are deemed halal, or clean, by Islamic scholars.
And they are becoming a popular route for Muslims who want to buy homes, bankers said.

The Fed now seems to be in a race against the economy's gathering strength, with policy makers hoping that they did not keep interest rates low for a long enough time to ignite inflation.
Many Wall Street economists are growing worried about that possibility, while others -- especially on the left -- say that job and wage growth remain too weak for serious inflation fears.
The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Ben Bernanke, speaking with reporters, said: "Inflation is well contained, under control.
The core inflation rate over the last year is about 2 percent, and I see inflation remaining well contained going forward."

Investors expect the benchmark rate, the federal funds rate, to reach 4.25 percent by the end of the year, based on the price of a futures contract that tracks Fed actions.
That would require the Fed to lift the rate at each of its three remaining meetings in 2005.

"A policy mistake may have been made," said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm.
"They may have lingered too long" at interest rates that will eventually cause a surge in inflation.
The housing boom, a recovery in business investment and strong consumer spending have kept the economy growing at a steady pace despite oil prices that have reached the highest levels since the early 1980's, adjusted for inflation.
"Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained," it said, "but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated."

The fact that long-term interest rates, including those on mortgages, remain lower than they were a year ago, when the Fed started raising rates, has perplexed many analysts, and the causes are not clear.
This has made the Fed's job more difficult, preventing the rate increases from slowing the economy as they typically do.

In recent weeks, long-term rates -- which are set by day-to-day trading in the bond market -- have risen somewhat, which probably took some pressure off Fed officials to issue a stronger statement about inflation risks.
The benchmark interest rate now exceeds inflation, which has been running about 2.5 percent a year, by a small amount.
In the language of the Fed, that means the rate is still below the "neutral" level and is still pushing the economy ahead instead of holding it back.

The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has declined to say publicly just what the neutral level is.
"We don't know what neutrality is until we get there," he told Congress last year.
Many forecasters say it is in the neighborhood of 4 percent, which is why they expect the Fed to continue raising its benchmark for the rest of the year.
In previous cycles, though, the Fed struggled to avoid overreaching, and raising or cutting rates more than looked necessary in hindsight.

"The spooky part is that Greenspan and others have said they don't know what neutral is," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG, "but they'll know it when they see it.
A fairer thing to say is probably that they don't know what neutral is, but they'll know it when they've passed it."

The labor market is also complicating the Fed's attempt to understand the economy's direction.
Wages for most workers have recently been rising no faster than inflation, often a sign that the economic growth is not healthy enough to set off inflation.
New technologies and the movement of some jobs to low-wage nations seem to be holding back wage and price increases.
But another possibility is that pay increases will come with time.
Raises often lag behind job growth by months or even years, and some economists say that the Fed should continue increasing interest rates to prevent wages, and inflation, from spiraling over the next year.

"In the short term, this is probably not that significant," said Jim McCormick, the global head of currency research at Lehman Brothers, said referring to this week's announcement.
"But it does indicate that they are putting all the pieces in place to have a more flexible exchange rate."
China also could exert a lot of influence because it has amassed huge foreign reserves, purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of United States Treasury bills, which could affect interest rates in the United States and the rest of the world.

In moving toward currency changes, however, China has chosen to disclose little about the timing of its decision or how its new system will operate, partly out of fear of the effects on the global financial markets.
Analysts expect China to continue to revalue its currency, allowing the yuan to appreciate further against the dollar in a controlled manner.
The Chinese government said recently that it would move slowly in revaluing, fearing that too sharp a move could disrupt its economy.
China has even suggested that it might not allow any further appreciation of the yuan this year.
Chinese officials are giving few other clues about when or whether Beijing will act again to strengthen the currency.
But economists and experts are all searching for clues to how its value is determined.
"If China has a currency that is going to appreciate," said Chua Hak Bin, an economist at DBS Bank in Singapore, "then your currency becomes more competitive relative to China and your exports should do better."

So Taiwan and Thailand, whose electronics exports compete with those from China, would seem poised to benefit from a higher yuan.
The same goes for South Korea.
But there is another rationale.
The higher yuan means that Asia's other currencies will rise, so foreign investors who buy stocks denominated in those currencies stand to see a return even if stock prices go nowhere.
Rising currencies would tend to cancel out any additional export competitiveness gained as a result of the yuan's rise, however.
Indeed, most Asian currencies have appreciated since China's move, including the ringgit, which Malaysia allowed to float freely after having pegged its value to the dollar since 1998.

And higher currencies are only part of the reason for some to invest in Asian markets.
So long as Asian currencies do not appreciate to correct the region's yawning trade surplus with the United States, its central banks will recycle dollar earnings by buying American debt, keeping interest rates in the United States artificially low and financing continued American purchases of Asian goods, perpetuating the region's export engine.

Many economists said that China's decision to move the yuan 2 percent higher against the dollar and to begin using a basket of currencies to determine its target value, in place of the dollar peg, would do little to reverse this cycle.
And the inflows of foreign funds into Asia's stock markets are only part of a buying binge that has put more than $20 billion into the region's markets so far this year, the biggest influx since at least 2000.

As Mr. Duncan said, despite this huge influx of investment, many Asian stocks still look cheap relative to corporate earnings, because of growing exports and low interest rates.
So in many markets, speculation about the effect of a higher yuan is by no means the only thing driving prices higher.
And in some, analysts say, the higher yuan may have little impact, or even a negative one.

India, for example, does not compete with China for manufactured exports and so is unlikely to see much change to its competitiveness, yet it has seen a rise in foreign buying since China's revaluation.
Indonesia competes with China in textiles and it exports raw materials to China, so a more expensive yuan could help Indonesia sell more clothes and enable China to buy even more wood, palm oil and natural gas.
But most of those benefits are likely to be a long way down the road.
In the meantime, Indonesia's economy is under pressure as high oil prices force the government to lower subsidies on fuel, causing prices to rise, increasing unemployment and reducing consumer spending.

Economists say that prices have been driven up by oldest equation of all -- global demand outpacing the supply, compounded by unease in the Middle East and a lack of new refineries for processing oil into gasoline.

Economists also say the context of the energy surge is crucial to how people are responding.
In the 70's, they say, higher gasoline prices were seen by many people as part of a fabric of woes like inflation, high interest rates and cold war tensions with the Soviet Union.
Today, with low interest rates and easy credit card access, many people can absorb, or at least postpone, the pain without changing their behavior all that much.

But at least one economist -- though there may be others out there hiding under their desks -- said he thought that gasoline prices were still not high enough and that Americans in a time of war should be making greater sacrifices for their country through higher gasoline taxes.

Professor Loewenstein said a gradual increase in the gasoline tax, as opposed to market-driven price increases that he said benefited mainly oil producers, would help the federal budget deficit and decrease dependence on foreign oil by encouraging conservation.

Since February, his station, WSEE -- Channel 35 in Erie, the 143rd-biggest television market in the United States -- has taped four Caribbean weather reports daily.
It has fed them to the Primetime24 satellite, which WSEE provides with CBS network programs.
"I probably have more viewers all through the Caribbean than I do in Erie," said Mr. Stevens, who is WSEE's chief meteorologist.
"I tell my buddies I could probably walk into any bar in the Caribbean and get a free drink."
(The station's viewers in Pennsylvania do not see the Caribbean forecasts; a seven-day outlook, is available at www.35wsee.com/caribbean.cfm.)
Most evenings, Mr. Stevens, a meteorologist in the Erie area for 28 years, shows pictures of sunsets and beach scenes submitted by his Caribbean fans and does goofy dances to leaven forecasts that often consist of monotonous strings of sunny, hot days.
When a country buys more from foreigners than it sells to them -- as the United States does -- the result is a trade gap that must be plugged by selling off American assets, mostly corporate and government bonds.
We've seen that system, for lack of a better word, function swimmingly in the past few days.
That would be fine, and the markets -- and the American people -- could continue to breathe easy, if the foreign capital flowing into the United States were purely a sign of American economic vitality.
Unfortunately, that's not the case.
A big reason that foreign money is coming here is that interest rates in the United States are higher than elsewhere.
That may -- or may not -- continue for some time, but attracting capital because one's rates are better is generally considered only a temporary advantage.
When conditions change, the focus of investors and traders shifts to fundamental strengths and weaknesses -- the underpinnings that determine the long-term health of an economy.

Looked at that way, attracting the money the United States needs could well require even higher interest rates than those currently on offer.
That's because the United States' budget and trade deficits and its heavy foreign indebtedness are significant fundamental weaknesses.

More disturbing still, the trade gap itself is likely to grow substantially and require ever greater foreign financing.
Factoring in higher energy costs, future deficits are likely to be higher than June's by tens of billions of dollars every month for the near future, if not for a long time to come.
Even before the recent spikes in oil prices, the United States was on track for a trade deficit this year of more than $700 billion, easily twice the size that most economists consider sustainable.
The United States will always manage to finance its deficits.
The question is how high the interest rates will have to go.
The answer depends in large part on getting the fundamental weaknesses under control.

Dr. Artandi chose to study the effects of telomerase on mouse fur not to develop a Rogaine for rodents, but because mice have an easily accessible stem cell system built into their skin.
Each hair follicle has attached to it a small bulb full of stem cells.
When the stem cells are activated, the follicle grows a new hair shaft.
Dr. Artandi's team genetically engineered a strain of mice in which the telomerase gene could be turned on with a drug.
The usual role of telomerase is to maintain the telomeres, special lengths of DNA that cap each end of the chromosomes.
But it performs this service only for egg and sperm cells and to some extent for stem cells.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The telomerase gene is switched off almost entirely in normal cells.
So each time a normal cell divides, its telomeres become shorter, and after they dwindle to a certain length, the cell is forced into senescence and cannot divide again.

For several years, there have been hints that the telomerase protein performs some role other than just maintaining telomeres.
Dr. Artandi said he had decided to look for that role in stem cells, because the gene that makes the enzyme is active in these cells.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
To avoid confusion with the telomere-lengthening role of telomerase, he engineered the mice to lack the additional biochemical machinery needed to maintain telomeres.
But when this new pathway is understood, it may suggest ways of tackling diseases in which the right cells fail to proliferate like pancreatic islet cells in diabetes.
Normal male mice do not go bald as they age, but the research could still be significant for human beings.
The finding about telomerase in mice "doesn't prove that this is the master regulator of all hair follicle cycling," Dr. Oro said, but it helped define the players.
Telomerase experts not involved in this study are enthusiastic about the finding, which opens out an unexpected line of inquiry about their favorite gene.
"I think it is an extremely important observation," said Ron DePinho of the Harvard Medical School.

Elizabeth Blackburn of the University of California, San Francisco, said that "biologically it's intriguing" that telomerase should have two such different roles.

Many successful specialty REIT's have what are known as triple-net leases, in which the tenants agree to pay all the ongoing operating expenses, including the property taxes and insurance premiums.
Most net leases are long term (10 to 25 years) with cost-of-living increases in the rent.
Of course, they are only as good as the creditworthiness of the tenants.
THERE are other risks with specialty REIT's: not only are they subject to the market conditions that affect commercial real estate in general, like interest rates, but their performance may also be tied to a mix of industry-specific variables.
Because of those uncertainties, "they tend to trade at higher dividend yields than traditional properties," Mr. Block said.

So if there are high vacancy rates, he added, "they may not be able to restructure to a different use."

Capital Automotive is another standout.
While domestic automakers grapple with poor earnings, downgraded debt and soaring employee health care costs, Capital Automotive prospers.
"It's a very good company; the dealers are in good shape," said Mr. Martin of Stifel Nicolaus.
David S. Kay, chief financial officer at Capital Automotive, says his company focuses on high-traffic locations within the biggest markets.
"We're continuously mixing the brands" depending on regional tastes, he said.
Tenants are generally unaffected by Detroit's problems, he added.
"People still need service and repair -- that's the main thrust of their profits," he said.
But the company doesn't seem to be taking any chances.
In the last quarter, Capital Automotive began providing mortgages, a strategy that it says could provide new sources for capital and help build better relationships with dealers.
This one word -- itkhanana -- has the town talking.
While the word comes from the root to strangle, it is used in everyday conversation as an expression of exasperation, and its use as a political slogan has resonated here because it has captured the public mood -- tired, angry and fed up, linguistic experts and political commentators have been saying.

"In Egypt it is revolutionary," said Nabil Shawkat, a linguist based in Cairo.
"You are using a word that is a borderline insult as a slogan of a campaign."
The race for the presidency officially began last week, and candidates are stumping around the nation.
Mr. Mubarak has also taken to the campaign trail, giving speeches, laying out an agenda and sprinkling in actual plans for what would be his fifth six-year term as president, should he win.

But so far, nothing has quite captured the public's attention -- or defined the opportunities, as well as the limits of this new campaign season -- as the Wafd political advertisements.
Wafd is one of modern Egypt's oldest parties, with a grand liberal tradition, and a reputation for being somewhat staid and out of touch.
The party is running its chairman, Noaman Gomaa, against Mr. Mubarak.
"This is exactly the way the Egyptians feel," said Muhammad Sherdy, a spokesman for the party.
"This is exactly our feeling.
We are suffocating.
We have reached our limits, in everything."

The Egyptian authorities were at first neither nostalgic nor amused by the Wafd slogan.
The newspapers relented, though the word remains banned from the television advertisements.
"We are trying, we are trying inch by inch, to get democracy, for God sake, in a country that is so scared," Mr. Sherdy said.
"If they tell you this shows there is democracy, they are doing this and allowing this just to get the chance to say 'See, there is democracy."'

Using the word itkhanana is an escalation of a kind of political speech that began to emerge here a year ago, with the start of a movement called Kifaya, which means "enough."
But now, Wafd has gone a step further, saying in effect, Mr. Shawkat said, "We are fed up with you."

That is the second problem with "Kicked Out": it's unconvincing.

Rising prices for iron ore, copper and other commodities contributed $5.7 billion to the company's pretax earnings.

Economists generally seem convinced that the higher energy prices will not derail the economy.
But they may cause it to wobble a bit: Americans will spend $600 billion this year on oil purchases -- everything from gasoline and diesel to jet fuel and heating oil.
In two years, the national oil bill has jumped by $210 billion, or 54 percent, according to Larry Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
In addition, the nation spent $120 billion on natural gas in 2004, according to the American Gas Association.
That is expected to increase to about $167 billion this year.
"High energy prices act like a consumption tax and consumption taxes eventually hurt the economy," Mr. Goldstein said.
That extra burden has already shaved three-quarters of a percentage point off American growth, he estimated, but has not put much of a dent in the expanding economy.

Last year, it was up to 4.2 percent.

"We've insulated ourselves from higher oil prices, but we're not immune to them," Mr. Goldstein said.
Americans are not completely helpless, Mr. Bookhart said.
"Most homes are very energy-inefficient.
There are many small things that can be done that will lead to pretty significant cost savings."
Sheryl Andersen, who lives in Crete, Ill., has followed that advice.
She has been weatherproofing her new house in expectation of paying higher heating bills: fixing leaks, putting weather stripping around doors, tuck-pointing the chimney and fixing cracks in the fireplace.
This year, she expects to spend twice that.

This may be little comfort for people like Stan Sawyer, a school district superintendent in Westbrook, Me.

In addition to trying to curb gasoline consumption, Mr. Sawyer faces another problem: His district budgeted heating oil purchases at only $1.60 a gallon -- well below even the current commodity market price for delivery next month, which is above $1.80 and climbing.

Natural gas, used by more than half of all households for heating, is expected to rise 16.5 percent, to $12.97 for each thousand cubic feet, while the price of propane, a liquid gas, is forecast to jump by 16 percent, according to Dave Costello, an analyst at the energy administration.
And these estimates may prove low.
Last year, heating oil and natural gas prices increased by about a third over the winter.

But this year is going to be very hard on our budget.
We might have to postpone renovations, or buying new equipment.

Many analysts predict more increases in prices through the end of the year, as well as into 2006.
"Heating is a visceral necessity; you've got to heat your home," said John Felmy, senior economist at the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group.
"This is when we might expect more of a sticker-shock reaction than with gasoline prices.

So far, American consumers have proved surprisingly resilient to the higher energy prices.
Despite the rise in gasoline costs, in recent weeks they have still been buying Detroit's gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, in large part because of deep discounts offered by American automakers.
Consumers have not visibly reduced spending, the housing boom has slowed only somewhat and interest rates, while rising, are still relatively low.

According to Goldman Sachs commodity analysts, there is little chance that crude oil prices will drop quickly.

There is also little relief to expect on natural gas markets.
While the use of fuel oil is mostly concentrated in the Northeast, natural gas is the heating source of choice for some 61 million households across the country.
While much of the attention has been focused on crude oil and gasoline, natural gas markets have boomed as well in recent years.
Through the 1990's, prices remained fairly stable, averaging about $2 a thousand cubic feet for the benchmark spot price in the United States.

But in early 2000, prices began to rise, averaging $5 a thousand cubic feet from 2000 to 2005.
"A lot will depend on consumer behavior and whether they will be overwhelmed by the higher prices and cut on their consumption," said David N. Parker, president of the American Gas Association.
"We don't see any reduction in the heating costs in the next two to three years.
Beyond that, there will be a flow of additional supplies.
But we will never go back to $2 gas.

TALE OF TWO COUNTRIES -- While the Bush administration was unveiling a modest overhaul of fuel economy regulations for light-duty trucks, China drafted plans to impose steep taxes on cars and gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles.
Already this summer, China has adopted tougher fuel economy standards than those in the United States.
Washington this week proposed increasing the average mileage of light trucks, including S.U.V.
's, pickup trucks and minivans sold nationwide, to 24 miles a gallon for 2011 models, up from 21.2 miles a gallon in today's models.
The rules would cost automakers an estimated $6 billion, officials said, but would save consumers $7 billion to $7.5 billion, based on prices of $1.51 to $1.58 a gallon.

The administration will submit a final rule by April.
The three-month comment period is certain to include discussion about the government's assumptions about gasoline mileage.
In China, where the government-regulated retail price for gasoline averaged $1.73 a gallon this month, the planned taxes are expected to be adopted in the next couple of months.

Hendrix frequently lashed out at people, but Cross, in prose that is often credulous and workmanlike, fails to see the significance of his aggression.
Could it be that his not-so-infrequent drunken outbursts were, along with the violence in his guitar, his only means of expressing frustration?

He added, "This type of action can only be taken on specific complaints."
But the ingrained habits of bribery persist in part because the poor, powerless in so many aspects of their lives, are afraid to object.
They worry that their newborns will get bad medical care from angry health workers.
They dread retribution when they return for subsequent births.

But the process of remaking Citigroup has been bloody.
Prince's plans.
After being told by the board he would have to give up some retirement perks, Mr. Weill chose to stay.
Already unhappy with Citigroup's weak earnings and its flagging stock price, investors now wonder whether the management shake-up is nearly over.
If Mr.
Prince now has his team in place, as some Citigroup executives say they believe, that might alleviate at least some investor concerns.
Still, as top executives like Mr. Willumstad and Ms. Magner depart, they take with them years of operating and deal-making experience.

Many of the new rising stars inside Citigroup who now make up Mr.
Prince's inner circle are relatively young, mostly in their 40's.
They, along with Mr.
Prince, now have to prove to Wall Street that the new generation has the ability to kick-start earnings growth.

There are some who welcome the shake-up.
"People got all upset because they don't like to see people they know getting pushed out, and they don't know the new people coming in," said Richard X. Bove, an analyst with Punk, Ziegel & Company.
"But this company has been underperforming for some time.
Significant change is needed."

Mr. Banga and Mr. Freiberg will play important roles in Mr.
Prince's new direction.
In a departure from his predecessor's emphasis on investment banking and the corporate customer, Mr.
Prince is focusing the bank to a much greater degree on the consumer, both in the United States and abroad.
"We have the opportunity to grow the consumer business dramatically," Mr.
Currently, global retail banking makes up 61 percent of Citigroup's profits.
One of the biggest pushes inside Citigroup will be to expand its presence rapidly in fast-growing international markets.
"Our market share is quite small in a number of the attractive markets," said Mr. Banga, who will oversee the international push from New York.
"We will be looking for ways to grow organically and inorganically."

Mr. Banga is no stranger to retail banking overseas.
An outgoing and charismatic man who is known inside Citigroup for reaching outside the bank's fiefs to contact colleagues about new ideas, Mr. Banga was born and reared in India, where his father was a member of the Indian army.
He started his career at Nestlé, where one of his first jobs entailed getting up at 4 a.m. to collect milk from nearby farms.

In 2002, Mr. Banga was named president of North American retail banking, reporting to Ms. Magner.
The more difficult task, though, in driving earnings may fall to Mr. Freiberg, who will be looking for ways to strengthen Citigroup's retail presence in the United States.

Unlike Mr. Banga, Mr. Freiberg has spent his entire 25-year career inside Citigroup, starting with the credit card group, then a fledgling unit, in the early 1980's.
More introverted than Mr. Banga, Mr. Freiberg has a reputation for fixing problems and running extremely efficient operations.
Over the years, he has worked in a variety of strategic, finance and operational roles, including taking over a money-losing Citigroup retail branch network in Miami in the mid-1990's and making it profitable within two years.

But in 1997, with the credit card division bleeding money, Mr. Reed asked Mr. Freiberg to return to his roots.

Citigroup's former chief operating officer, Michael T. Masin, said, "You could see his remarkable knowledge of the credit card industry, his ability to focus on what the customer wants and to deliver that in a very cost-efficient way."
Under Mr. Freiberg's watch, Citigroup's credit card division has grown to more than 125 million card accounts and has about $140 billion in loans outstanding.

Still, Mr. Freiberg faces mounting challenges in the United States banking market.
Credit card growth is slowing as consumers use home equity loans to pay off higher-interest credit card debt.
The red-hot mortgage and refinance market is expected to cool somewhat this year.
And Citigroup's earnings, like those of other banks, are under attack as short-term interest rates rise while long-term rates hold steady.
Banks make money by pocketing the difference between what they pay on interest on deposits and what they charge on long-term loans.
"There is a high degree of maturity in the markets here," Mr. Freiberg said.
"We want to become more intense on broadening out our relationship with our large embedded base of customers."

Toward the end of an interview, the two executives struck a pose for the photographer, with Mr. Banga seated in a chair and Mr. Freiberg standing behind him.

European officials hold out hope for a revival of talks between Iran and Europe, though they, too, are frustrated.

"Two and a half years have passed, and patience is wearing thin," said an official close to the agency, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the report was not being made public.
The report also confirmed that Iran has begun processing nuclear fuel, ending a voluntary suspension of such activity during talks about its program with Britain, France and Germany.
Diplomats have been eagerly awaiting the report, by the agency's director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, because some hoped it would give them fresh ammunition to take tougher steps against Iran.

Much of the information, however, was in the agency's last major report on Iran, in November 2004.
And the agency's conclusion -- that it is not in a position to say whether the government is pursuing a clandestine nuclear program -- remains unchanged.

What the document does disclose is mounting frustration within the agency about its inability to get answers to questions, despite repeated requests and visits to Iran by its inspectors.
Departing from its carefully neutral tone, it concludes, "In view of the fact that the agency is not in a position to clarify some important outstanding issues after two and a half years of intensive inspection and investigation, Iran's full transparency is indispensable and overdue."
Among the mysteries is how Iran first obtained centrifuges used to enrich uranium.
The agency would like to interview scientists who worked there.

The government continues to resist the agency's efforts to conduct a full inspection of a site in Parchin, where Iran is suspected of nuclear activities.
Inspectors on limited visits have not found nuclear material.

Plutonium, like highly enriched uranium, can be used to make nuclear explosives.
Iran, which contends its nuclear program is peaceful, said the report had both "positive and negative points."
Pledging to cooperate with the agency, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Ali A. Larijani, said Friday on state television, "Many of the questions have been answered from a legal and technical point of view."
One that is likely to benefit Iran is the report's investigation of sites that were contaminated by highly enriched uranium and low-enriched uranium.

The Iranian government contends the equipment was contaminated in Pakistan before it was exported to Iran.
"We are not yet sure everything is O.K., " said the agency official.
"But in a big picture, yes, it tends to support their statement."

Some of the disclosures in the report could provide ammunition to both critics and defenders of Iran.

For example, it notes discrepancies in Iran's account of its plutonium research activities, which critics have recently cited as evidence that Iran is trying to conceal a weapons program.

Iranian officials have since explained that they were "purifying" this plutonium for other research purposes.
"We want to see these talks resumed because we not only believe this is in the interests of the international community, but also in the interests of Iran," Mr.

To her amazement, her landlady and the co-op agreed.
Ms. Zeller, who now works in marketing for a magazine, borrowed $20,000 from her 401(k), which went toward her fees of nearly $15,000.
She had planned on borrowing against it, or using what she has in her fund as leverage for a separate loan that has interest but is not taxed as income.
Come tax time, she estimated, because of this maneuver she will owe about $7,000 in income tax and have to pay an early withdrawal penalty of $2,000.
"I will get killed in taxes next year," Ms. Zeller said.

Ms. Zeller immediately got on her phone and tracked down the officer, who said she would have to decide between paying $1,200 to extend her rate or take the new rate at 5.625 percent, which would have meant paying $30 more a month or $360 more a year.

Even when a buyer is not looking at new construction, the timing of the shelf life of a rate is vital.
Beth Divney, a loan officer with Manhattan Mortgage, said the most important thing when working with first-time buyers is that they realize that a mortgage rate quotation is just a quotation until it is locked in, in writing.
Also, it eventually expires.
"If a rate is not locked in for a long enough time to close, it is nothing," she said.

Like Mr. Scott, Keri Resnick and David Kasdan, both 26, are part a new breed of first-time buyers: investors.

When Ms. Resnick, who works for the real estate sales firm Shvo Marketing, began handling Bryant Park Tower at West 39th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, she thought the condos were a wise investment.

She called up the son of a colleague of her mother, Mr. Kasdan, who does small-scale real estate development in New Jersey, with a 50-50 proposition.

They hope to sell it for a profit in a few years, before the details of who owes whom money becomes too complicated or acrimonious.

"Most renters are saying, 'I should have bought something five years ago,"' Ms. Resnick said.
"They shouldn't worry about the money, too much.
There are many banks that will do 100 percent financing or 95 percent financing."
The Compromisers
"We've recently refocused our search to Brooklyn," James Bachman said haltingly from the middle of an apartment search with his fiancée, Tiffany Handshoe.
"It is very painful."
"My preference is not to go into a co-op," Mr. Bachman, an administrative director for the radiation oncology department at New York University cancer center, explained.
"My preference is to go condo in Manhattan.

"We spent a few days sulking."
The Gifted
Everyone wants to know how much they need.
"When people come to me with no money available to put down, I have to say, 'Call me in a year,"' said Amy Schulman, an agent at Corcoran.
"Or maybe they've been saving for two years and they've gotten somewhere and you have to tell them it is still not enough."

Ms. Schulman, whose buyers are mostly looking at Manhattan co-ops, said that building requirements can be daunting.
In general, the co-ops require a 20 percent down payment and co-op boards want to see that a buyer has two years' worth of monthly payments in liquid assets after closing.
For most co-op buildings, a buyer needs to have a 25 percent debt-to-income ratio.

What this means is that a person earning $10,000 a month (or a pretty significant $120,000 a year) can take on carrying costs, including mortgage and maintenance payments as well as any ongoing fees like school loans or car payments, of only $2,500 a month.
What is more, after the 20 percent down payment and closing costs, this person needs to have two years' worth of $2,500 payments (or $60,000) available.

A search for apartments in Manhattan last week with combined carrying charges of less than $2,500 a month, given a $50,000 down payment, gleaned four one-bedrooms between $250,000 and $350,000 in Washington Heights and Inwood, a 425-square-foot studio on the Upper East Side and a 220-square-foot studio in Tudor City.
"As you can see," Ms. Schulman said, "even people who make $100,000 a year can't get the apartment they want."

That's why so many people need a company bonus or a family gift to get to the next level of purchasing power.
"With any first-time buyer, I start with, 'We need to prepare your parents that they might need to help out,"' said Judy Maysles, an agent with Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy.
Now they are really wiping out their life savings to pay the 20 or 25 percent down.

A long list of fund companies have agreed to ban the practice, and to pay about $3 billion worth of fines, restitution and fee reductions to investors harmed by the trading.
In recent months, however, some parties have begun to challenge Mr. Spitzer in the mutual fund investigation and beyond.
In June, a jury found against the attorney general on most charges in a criminal case against a former broker at Bank of America, Theodore C. Sihpol III.
Mr. Spitzer had accused Mr. Sihpol of helping Canary Capital Partners, a hedge fund, in market timing.
The same month, certain banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase, sought to prevent Mr. Spitzer from investigating whether the banks were charging excessive interest rates on mortgages to minorities.
A court hearing is scheduled for today in Federal District Court in Manhattan on the matter.
It also said it would reduce fees on one of those funds by 0.05 percent for two years beginning in June 2004.

Seligman said monitoring its fees "is the regulatory province of the S.E.C., and only the S.E.C.," the lawsuit said.
Requiring a third party to review how fees are set has been a condition of all of Mr. Spitzer's settlements with fund companies to date, said David D. Brown IV, director of the attorney general's Investment Protection Bureau and the person overseeing the day-to-day operations of the mutual fund investigation.

The fee reductions, however, have been criticized by officials at the S.E.C., who have said it is not the role of the government to set prices.

Even with the fee reductions, expenses at many Seligman funds are above average, Mr. Brown said, citing data from Morningstar, a research firm that tracks mutual funds.
"Why don't they want to join other mutual fund companies in reducing inordinately high fees?"
Expenses at Seligman funds, on average, are 1.93 percent of assets, according to Morningstar, compared with an average of 1.47 percent at large fund companies.
Performance at many Seligman funds has also been weak.
Last year, Seligman named a new chief investment officer, John B. Cunningham, who is making positive changes at the firm, said Todd Trubey, a Morningstar analyst.

"He came in to clean things up and we have found him to be a pretty straight shooter," Mr. Trubey said.

That group, which also includes the commercial real estate trading unit, is now part of the new venture, called Dillon Read Capital Management.
UBS invested an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion in the venture, according to two people inside the company, making the initial work for Mr. Costas significantly easier.
"We have the chance to be the No.1 alternative asset management company in the world," he said.
The move is not without risks.
Interest rates are rising, making it harder for banks to borrow at low rates and lend or invest at higher ones, meaning hedge funds may not find it so easy to make money with fixed-income strategies.

The new venture includes a number of businesses that face tremendous volatility and uncertainty.
Fears of a real estate bubble are widespread and the bursting of such a bubble would have a major impact on the commercial real estate market.

None of that appears to faze Mr. Costas, who, like every good salesman, sees the hedge fund and fixed-income markets as pure opportunity.
So why abandon the suite of power for the sweat of the trading floor?
"Most C.E.O.
's do not leave peacefully," said Roy Smith, a professor of finance at New York University and a former partner at Goldman Sachs.
"But there's a motivation to leave, a function of the monetary inducement of running a hedge fund and a $3 billion infusion without having to run around raising the money," he said.
The economics of the hedge fund business -- fees of 1 to 2 percent and 20 percent of the profits -- mean that Mr. Costas could make more money as a trader than as a Wall Street chief executive.

But Mr. Costas, who grew up in a middle-class family in Philadelphia -- and remains a devoted Philadelphia Eagles fan -- insists his career shift was not about money.

"At the end of the day, it came down to what I do from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.," he said.
"You live once so it was for the challenge of building a world-class business, not just the money associated with it."
What makes his decision seemingly odd -- or perhaps just very wise -- is his success at UBS.
After epic failures at trying to break into the cutthroat investment banking business, UBS may be the only foreign bank to have entered Wall Street's "bulge bracket," or Top 5 ranking.

The stellar results of UBS are a combination of luck, branding and opportune business decisions.
In 1999, UBS was an also-ran on Wall Street despite being one of the largest private banks in the world.
The bank had taken many stabs at building or buying a presence in the United States, only to reverse strategy, pull back or shop the bank at different times.

Indeed, things were so grim at UBS that an e-mail message circulated on Wall Street in 1999 with a replica of the poster from "Saving Private Ryan" featuring UBS's chairman, Marcel Ospel, instead of Tom Hanks, with the phrase, "Saving Private Banking."

Having the machine of UBS behind him helped.
As business has become more global -- the investment bank was able to leverage its traditional strengths in Europe and Asia to its growing client base in the United States.
Its top-tier credit rating meant that it could borrow money at historically low rates.
That's never happened.
Mr. Costas is cut from a different cloth than many other chief executives.
He shuns public functions ("I don't look good in a tux," he said), and does not seem to care about the fact that UBS is still treated like a second-class citizen by others on Wall Street.
He seems to relish his roots -- he is married to his date from his high school junior prom -- from his loyalty to the Eagles to being adamant about attending the sports functions of his children.

Which may be the real story behind Mr. Costas's move.
With all the power and glory of being a chief executive -- and to be fair, he was the chief of one unit of a sprawling Swiss bank -- it may just be more fun being a trader.
Out of the executive suite and back to the trading floor, Mr. Costas has leapt from the behind the scenes into the fray and back to his roots.
Careful though.
"It's not cut and dry that everyone is better off" filing now, said Henry Sommer, president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys.
"It's going to be more complicated and more expensive after Oct. 17, but that might be outweighed by other benefits."

One complication is that debtors will lose the ability to decide whether filing under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 is best for them, said Stephen Ware, a law professor at the University of Kansas who specializes in consumer bankruptcy.
Right now, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy can eliminate unsecured debts like medical bills and credit cards.
It will not wipe out student loans, car loans, mortgages or back taxes.
And if you own any property or assets, those will be sold to pay your creditors.
Thus if you have property you want to protect, you might choose to file under Chapter 13, which is more of a repayment plan.
NOW that choice will be made by the courts, based on your means test.
"If a debtor's income is equal to or above the state median income, then the debtor may be excluded from Chapter 7," Mr. Ware said.

So if you have a higher income, a lot of unsecured debt and don't have a lot of property to protect, now could be the time to file.
Another factor, said Brian Methner, a bankruptcy lawyer in Denver, is if you're depleting assets that you could protect by filing for bankruptcy now.

"The minute, and I mean the literal minute, you file bankruptcy," Mr. Methner said, "you will be inundated with credit card applications, mortgage applications, car loan applications."
The interest rates may be high and the terms may not be ideal, but borrow you can.
The bigger question is whether you should.
If you're worried about rebuilding your credit rating, a secured card and prompt payments are the best way to go -- particularly if the reason for bankruptcy isn't a layoff, illness or divorce, but living above and beyond your means.
For those whose InStyle lifestyle was their undoing, experts caution that bankruptcy may ease your debts, but it won't solve your problems.
Mr. Sommer's advice: "Be more careful about budgeting and not falling prey to predatory lenders.
Be more wary of credit in general."

For one thing, the previous owner wasn't quite up front about the difficulties she would face with some of the tenants -- drug sales in the hallways, nonpaying tenants, code violations caused by tenants, the woman with 10 grandchildren, three other adults and a dog in one apartment.

To those who have dealt over the years with small landlords, the major pitfall is obvious.
"If you get a tenant from hell and it takes eight months to evict this person," said Mr. Castellano, owner of Picture Properties, a real estate brokerage firm in the Rockaways, "how are you going to carry the mortgage on your own?"
In today's bullish real estate market, with its low interest rates and aggressive mortgage marketing, it is also true that home seekers are often pushed to buy "as much house" as they can afford, under the assumption that their incomes will increase.
"That's why they're vulnerable, because the first couple of years they're counting nickels to pay their bills," Mr. Castellano said.
And for first-time landlords -- so often double-income couples buying a two- or three-family home -- that recalcitrant renter is just one land mine.
"What if one of them gets laid off or injured or pregnant, and their income goes down?"
"Sometimes the cushion is wide enough to manage one negative impact.
But two negative impacts and you're in foreclosure."

It hasn't quite come to that for Lloyd Noel and his mother, who took possession of a four-story, eight-unit building on New York Avenue in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, after her divorce in 2000.
Unlike the one nonpaying tenant out of 200 in a large apartment complex, the lone contentious tenant in an eight-unit building can cause considerable strain on a small landlord's income.
And that is true even if, as in Helen Noel's case, the elderly woman in Apartment 2L who still pays $95 a month for a rent-controlled apartment had some justification for all those Housing Court claims.
The family did not live on the premises, but Mr. Noel now rents an apartment for $800 a month.
The other rents are $1,200, $1,100, $953, $930, $853, $763 and $95 -- bringing the total rental income to $6,694 a month.
But with mortgage payments of $3,300 and other monthly expenses, including $900 for gas and $500 for insurance, the Noels tiptoe along a slim profit margin, especially with that low of $95 from the woman in 2L.

"My father and her used to battle it out in court," Mr. Noel said.
"Her apartment was in the worst condition in the building: holes in the floor, windows broken, doors missing.
She'd show pictures that it was never repaired and she would get a decrease."
"Knowing we had a ton of violations on that apartment, we haven't raised her rent," Mr. Noel said.
Now they are waiting for the city to verify that the violations have been cleared, "and after that we can raise her rent to $750," he said.

Advocating the safety of a "belt-and-suspenders budgeting approach," Sarah Gerecke, chief executive of Neighborhood Housing Services, said that small landlords should underestimate their monthly rental income by about 10 percent, in case an apartment is unexpectedly vacated, while creating a contingency fund equal to three months of operating expenses.

"It can be a successful marriage or a dysfunctional divorce," she said, pointing out that in two- and three-family home situations, where a tenant is often a relative, things can get particularly sticky.
"You may need to learn to resolve conflicts in a different way," she said.
"Yes, we're relatives, but this is business."
Relative or not, new tenant or old, the relationship must be based on "communication of clear expectations," Ms. Gerecke said.
Among the matters that should be discussed in advance, she said, are pets, smoking, parking, garbage removal, even who changes the light bulbs and, of course, noise.
"Maybe headphones should come with the lease," she said.
"Is the upstairs apartment carpeted?"

Sherwin Belkin, a real estate lawyer, leads new landlords through the intricacies of the process in Manhattan.
"Too often, I find that first-time landlords look only at the building's location, value, structural soundness and the ability to obtain clean title," he said.
"They should also thoroughly investigate who their current tenants are," particularly whether they are rent-regulated.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"The new landlord steps into the shoes of the prior owners," Mr. Belkin said, and needs to determine whether tenants are habitually delinquent in paying rent, or are litigious.
If a new landlord plans to take over all or several apartments for personal use, it is necessary to determine whether any rent-stabilized tenants are 62 or older or are disabled, "because he will be obligated to provide those people with a comparable relocation apartment," Mr. Belkin added.

And the new owner needs to know if any tenants have lived in rent-controlled apartments for more than 20 years, because they are immune from owner-occupancy proceedings.
Still, there are plenty of benefits to becoming a landlord, and many people enjoy it.
In February, Nelly Anderson bought a house on Maple Parkway in the Mariners Harbor section of northern Staten Island "and is glad to be a landlord," according to her son Elvis Byrd, 42, who lives in the house.
Mrs. Anderson, a home attendant who is 64 and nearing retirement, is enjoying both the comfort of living with kin and the benefits of rental income.

Mrs. Anderson bought the 1907 three-family house with cedar shingles and aluminum siding for $350,000, made a down payment of $35,000 and pays $2,040 a month on the mortgage -- more than covered by the rental income.
"You couldn't go wrong with buying a three-family home because you have someone helping pay the mortgage," Mr. Byrd said.
Dina Calhoun is also a novice landlord and describes her experiences as "so far, so good."
The couple and their 9-year-old son moved in in May, and are paying less than the $1,500 to $1,600 a month that most three-bedrooms in the neighborhood currently rent for.

New Landlords Can Get Help
TO guide neophyte landlords through the minefields of ownership, Neighborhood Housing Services, a nonprofit organization, offers classes for small landlords in all five boroughs.
About 2,200 people have taken the landlord classes since 1995.
(The organization also offers seminars for first-time home buyers.)
The landlord course covers the full array of issues facing a new building owner: mortgage, insurance, tax responsibilities, housing discrimination, building-code requirements, the intricacies of rent regulation, and writing the lease.
"Even if it's just a two-family, it's important to have a lease," said Sarah Gerecke, chief executive of Neighborhood Housing Services.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Landlords taking the course, which costs $100 and includes five two-hour sessions, are familiarized with the 26 governmental agencies that regulate one or another phase of rental housing in the city -- including the Buildings Department, the Fire Department, the Rent Guidelines Board, the Bureau of Electrical Control and the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
The course offers guidelines for writing a business plan.
"You start with knowing your operating expenses, so you can figure the minimum rents you must charge," Ms. Gerecke said.
The major expenses are the mortgage, taxes, utilities and insurance.
But what many people don't take into account, Ms. Gerecke said, are annual expenses, like servicing the boiler or cleaning the gutters, and major repairs in the future.
"Ten years down the road, the roof will need to be fixed," she said.

On Monday night Mr. Stoltenberg and his partners on the left seemed set to control some 88 seats in the 169-seat Parliament when it reopens in mid-October.
That would be enough to let him expand the state's role in social matters while enhancing environmental protections and reinstating some of the taxes that Mr. Bondevik has cut.
Under Mr. Bondevik's fragile coalition of Christian Democrats, Conservatives and Liberals, Norway experienced a surge in prosperity, with the stock market tripling since early 2003 on the strength of oil exports.

But letting the good times roll is not really the Scandinavian way.
Even at the cost of moderately higher taxes, most Norwegians on Monday seemed intent on protecting or expanding generous sick-leave, pregnancy-leave and job-security policies along with subsidized day care and free college tuition.
Like Mr. Stoltenberg, Mr. Bondevik campaigned as a champion of social spending, but his commitment to keeping interest rates low and cutting future taxes made him seem the guardian of a business-friendly status quo.
Since World War II, Labor has been dominant enough to rule by itself most of the time.
"It is the only Social Democratic party in western Europe that has never been in a coalition government," Professor Narud said.
Now Stoltenberg has rebuilt the image of the party and radicalized the profile."

The trick is finding a way to sell it to America's food elite.
A group of Icelandic agricultural and tourism officials think they've found the angle in a clunky but straightforward slogan: "Sustainable Iceland since 874."

The date marks the year a Norwegian Viking first set up housekeeping in Iceland.
The sustainable part is pure marketing, designed to appeal to American cooks who want to move beyond mere organics.
"People are really screaming for more knowledge of where the food comes from," said Baldvin Jonsson, the pleasantly emphatic Iceland-born consultant who is leading the country's food invasion.
"You tell them fish comes from the ocean, and they ask, 'What kind of ocean?
Is it a very polluted ocean or is it from a third-world country where people aren't getting paid enough to live for fishing?"'
Four years ago, Icelandic tourism officials began a food festival, flying in chefs from around the world to cook for a week filled with wine and lamb.

Starting with 28 stores in the mid-Atlantic states and rolling into the New York area by the end of the year, Whole Foods will be selling a variety of food under the "Sustainable Iceland" logo.
To make any money in the United States market, Iceland officials figured they would have to capture a slice of the natural products category, the fastest growing segment of the food business.
And that meant courting the biggest player, Whole Foods.
The company, which grew by 23 percent in 2004, sells about $4 billion worth of groceries a year.
The meat was available in only a handful of stores at first, but this month will arrive in more than 140.

And for the first time, the product line will expand to include cheese, beer, butter and possibly chocolate.
The Icelanders eventually plan to add trackable cod to the list.
Each fillet will be numbered, so shoppers can track the fish back to the boat that caught it.

"The culture of Iceland has something to do with why we considered these products in the first place," said Neal Weinberg, who coordinates specialty food for Whole Foods in the mid-Atlantic states.
"The quality of the products is what sold us."

Ms. Hanson was particularly impressed with the lamb, which comes from animals smaller than the ones most Americans are used to eating.
They are born in the spring, feed on grass, and then graze in the Icelandic highlands until September, when they are rounded up by farm families on horseback.
The animals spend another few weeks back in their home pastures to relax until they're slaughtered.
Mr. Jonsson is banking that American consumers will respond to the term "sustainable," which, unlike organic, isn't regulated by governments in Iceland or the United States but generally describes food that is grown in a way that preserves the land for future use and incorporates aspects of social responsibility.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Jonsson argues that Iceland was the first sustainable country in the world, and it remains one of the purest places from which to eat.
Certainly, the sheep stock hasn't been cross-bred or fed much differently from when Viking settlers first brought the animals to the island 1,100 years ago.
The North Atlantic waters that feed the cod industry is free of industrial pollution, at least of any that has originated from Iceland's shores.
Vegetables are grown in greenhouses warmed by volcanic vents and the country's biggest city is heated by geothermal energy.

But is it a marketing tool?
"We all agree the term sustainable is kind of wonkish," said Michael Straus, who does public relations work for progressive agricultural companies and whose family owns one of California's premier organic dairies.

There are a few holes in the plan.
For example, part of a sustainable ethos involves burning as little fuel as possible in delivering food from the farm to the table.
It's a concept called food miles.
The fewer miles food travels, the more sustainable it is.
Iceland is about a five-hour flight from New York.
There are other marketing hurdles.

Then there is the Ikea problem.
Americans may have figured out how to navigate a world of Swedish-language shopping in which a gosa skaplig is a pillow, but can a country that has barely learned to say Reykjavik (that's RAY-kya-veek) be able to figure out that "smjor" is butter?
Other products will include skyr (pronounced skeer), which is a tangy fresh low-fat cheese similar to yogurt that can serve as a base for a berry parfait.
Cheese will be sold under Icelandic names, too, including a brielike Hofdingi and the soft-rind blue cheese called Stori Dimon.

It remains possible that the Federal Reserve will refrain from raising short-term interest rates next Tuesday, which would be the first time in 11 meetings that it held rates steady.
The best reason to do that would be to wait for more evidence of the impact from the hurricane and the spike in gasoline prices in the last two weeks.
But that would be little more than a pause.
Fed officials are likely to repeat past declarations that their policy is "accommodative," meaning that interest rates are still below normal and need to go higher, and they are likely to repeat their desire to raise rates at a "measured" pace.
"The main point is that when they sit down, they will conclude that what we want to do is to continue to remove the accommodative policy," said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America.

Fed officials tend to view jumps in energy prices as one-time events rather than a source of permanent inflation, and a low rate of core inflation is normally a cause for relief.
Fed officials were already worried about other sources of inflation, like rising wages and slowing productivity growth, and several policy makers have expressed concern that high energy prices could lead to expectations of higher long-term inflation.

"Rising oil prices, like other unfavorable price shocks, can also feed through and raise underlying core inflation," Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, warned on Sept. 7.
"So there is also a risk on the inflation front, and the risk is higher now than it was a year ago."
Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and a former Fed governor, predicted on Thursday that Hurricane Katrina would lead to only a temporary slowdown in economic growth and employment.

"Katrina's effects may reduce growth in the short run, but the longer-term growth trajectory remains in place," Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the National Press Club.
The problem for Fed officials is that the data so far provide no conclusive evidence about the full economic impact of Katrina and the energy price shock.
If the impact on growth is small, a decision to keep interest rates low could aggravate inflation.
If high energy prices pinch spending and shatter confidence, higher interest rates could add to the problem.

The torrid run-up has helped push stocks in industries related to housing, like construction, to even greater advances.
Dow Jones's index of home construction stocks has risen 54 percent in the last 12 months, and its broader index of real estate securities is up 26 percent.
To avoid, or at least forestall, a reversal, housing demand must remain high and mortgage rates low, especially compared with the rate of economic growth (which also would have to stay healthy).
That is a tall order, and construction industry executives apparently are not willing to bet on it.

Simons is a fashion mystery, and maybe the most mysterious thing about him is that he just shows up.
But after searching the crowded club for an hour, she left.
Then last March, Gilhart was in Paris, waiting to take her seat at the Alexander McQueen show.
"I felt this tap on my arm, and my first thought was, Oh, please don't let it be a designer with a collection he wants to show me.
And he said, 'I'm Raf."'
Although a Simons show can look intimidatingly cool, he himself is warm, gentle, forthright.
With people he likes, he can quickly establish an intimacy that confuses both sexes.
I don't know.
A guy who will go to the beach with only a bag of Doritos and a bottle of Coke can't be that complicated.
Simons has been collecting contemporary art for years and has works by, among others, Katy Grannan and Evan Holloway.
But I also recall that he had a half-dozen boxes of Marlboro Lights stuffed in the door pockets of his car, all of them empty.

Simons is extremely sensitive -- you can make him cry -- and extremely masculine.
When I saw him a month later, in Vienna, where he was finishing a five-year stint as visiting fashion professor at the University of Applied Arts, he said that, with people with whom he is close: "I really like that it becomes very romantic.
Not only in a relationship but also in the friendships."

He went on: "People who don't know me look at my world as something very hard-core, and I don't feel it that way.
It's not what attracts me.
We go to the sea, five or six of us, and we're all in pajamas with candles around and watching movies.
O.K., maybe we're watching a good movie, but we also watch trash movies.
We've never really been that kind of group that goes to the scenes where all the cool people hang out."

The Belgian designer Veronique Branquinho, who was Simons's girlfriend between 1995 and 2000, agreed: "In a way, he's very much a family man.
He likes to be at home.
He's very cozy about his family."
Simons, who comes from a rural town near the Dutch and German borders and is the only child of a career soldier and a housecleaner, had studied industrial design at a university in Genk.
"Priests, priests, priests.
If one or two of your friends dressed differently, which of course in the 80's was black, you couldn't stand together on the playing field."
(Significantly, a number of Simons's collections have alluded to school uniforms and priests, and the casting of many of the same models reflects an early obsession with repetition.)

Today, Simons says that Snelders is one of the most important people in his company.
"He knows how important it is to have a couple of people around me -- 'family' is not the right word -- who are very intimate," Simons said.
"At a certain point he said to me, 'I know you don't ask me, but as long as you want to work with me, I will be with you."'

Simons can be very persistent, even "possessive," according to Linda Loppa, the head of the fashion department at the academy, who was a mentor to Simons.
"He wants to know everything from the people around him."
Branquinho said: "He's very demanding.
It's all about love as everything or nothing."
Yet the flip side to this devouring nature, Rizzo suggests, is a responsiveness to things that creates intense loyalties.
He was crying.
I was kind of comforting him.
Raf is a very emotional person.
He gets touched really deeply by things.
So fantastic, and I want to be part of this world.'
And I said, 'You will be part of this world."'
He has a general interest in people.
In that sense he was very into knowing everything."

Simons doesn't present his first collections for Jil Sander until early next year.
But while the chance to do both men's and women's clothes is exciting and will bring him some long-overdue recognition as well as financial security after years of running his own company rather close to the bone (often with as few as three people), it will not change his basic values and ideas.
So what is recognition?
For me, recognition is about people you have a relation with.
Somewhere, in some city in America, someone is wearing my clothes, and I'm happy with that."
Simons, who has a three-year contract with Sander, is also approaching the job -- and his relationship with Prada's chief executive, Patrizio Bertelli -- with the attitude of someone who has nothing to lose; unlike Sander and Helmut Lang, he has not sold his name.
"People are not going to judge my work and my label and me as a person if it's not going to work out," he said.
"And that makes it more convincing for me to go for it."
But it's pointless to speculate about whether he'll get along with Bertelli, who manages, it seems, to tick off everybody, including his wife, the designer Miuccia Prada; once, in a product meeting with her, he reportedly said that he would urinate on her handbags.
Simons says that his own dealings with Bertelli have been cordial, but he observed: "I think if he would listen
a little bit more, or a little longer, it would be a good difference for him and the people who work with him.
But I feel it more with the other people in the room.
Those people are all there to help him."

Snelders, though, worries for Simons.
He worries that the things that have so far been unimportant to Simons will find a way of entering his small, protective world -- maybe change it altogether.
"It sounds scary, but he needs to be left alone," Snelders told me.
"He spends way too much time on the phone doing interviews, daft stuff.
The phone is constantly ringing, like, for nothing.
He needs a new mobile phone."
The central question about Simons, and the one that has gone unanswered, is: How did he do it?
Surrounding himself with people like Snelders certainly helped.
(In that sense, Simons, for all his calculated distancing from the fashion world, is a seductive personality -- and he knows it.)
But this doesn't explain everything.
Although a number of writers have ascribed Simons's powers to intellect, he actually embodies a different quality.
He looks at everything very simply and directly.
"We admire geniuses, we love them, but they discourage us," he wrote.
"They are great concentrations of intellect and emotion, we feel that they have soaked up all the available power, monopolizing it and leaving none for us.
We feel that if we cannot be as they, we can be nothing."
In fashion, Karl Lagerfeld and John Galliano are geniuses, but they don't communicate the sense, as Simons does, that we can understand our world just by looking at it.
We feel we have to be as smart and cool as they are.
Simons, the coolest of designers, tells us differently.
Though a romantic is surely what he is.
They look at the surface, but I hunger for an ideal world always.
My mom and my dad, what they have together is amazing.
Then there's my village, with the grass fields and the woods and the animals."
This has been the perspective all along, from the eight-millimeter movie through to the recent collections -- of someone looking at contemporary life from the vantage of his own humble background and wanting to make it not merely right but better.
Not many designers would have the instinct to call a collection History of the World, as Simons did in July 2004, and have the models descend on a pair of huge escalators or print on their invitation the names of people and things that had changed the modern world, as if to suggest that fashion -- or any one of us -- could do the same.
How many people would make such a moral claim in a cynical age?
"We were all sitting there, waiting and wondering, Where are the models going to come from?"
"I'm looking through the haze of this warm summer evening, and then, in the distance, about three overpasses away, I see this line of boys in black suits walking along, like union workers, one after the other.
So eerie and so beautiful."

"I don't know," he said.
President Bush didn't say the other night how he would pay for his promise to rebuild the Gulf Coast states.
Allow us to explain: Every penny of aid approved by Congress so far and all subsequent aid -- perhaps as much as $200 billion -- will be borrowed, with most of it likely to come from Asian central banks and other foreign investors.
That means additional interest of about $10 billion a year indefinitely.
The bill will hit current and future taxpayers in the form of higher taxes or cuts in government programs, or both.
Don't get us wrong.
In the main, it makes sense to borrow for huge, vital and unexpected projects (World War II comes to mind).
Such borrowing spreads the immense costs over generations, all of which presumably benefit from the extraordinary spending.
The problem is that the United States was deep in hock before Katrina -- and for many of the wrong reasons.
Unless Congress changes the pre-Katrina priorities laid down by Mr. Bush, necessary borrowing for Katrina will occur on top of unjustified borrowing.
The resulting deficits could create deep economic distress, including higher interest rates, slower economic growth, future tax increases and constraints on the government's ability to be responsive, both to crises and to everyday needs, like health care.
Growing deficits also pose a security threat because increasing foreign indebtedness risks eroding the nation's position in the world.
Cutting taxes for the rich is the most glaring of the wrongheaded reasons to pile debt upon debt.
Since 2001, Congress has passed tax and spending legislation totaling $1.7 trillion.
Of that total, tax cuts for people who make more than $200,000 a year, the top 3 percent of the income ladder, have accounted for nearly 20 percent -- or about $330 billion.
"The widespread devastation in the gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production and employment will be set back in the near term," the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.

But it continued: "While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about the near-term economic performance, it is the committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat."
In an important hint about its desire to keep raising rates for a while longer, the central bank repeated its long-held expectation that "policy accommodation" -- meaning low interest rates -- could be reversed at a "measured" pace.

In a rare departure from the Fed's normal unity, one member of the policy committee, Mark W. Olson, voted against the rate increase.

But it did not necessarily portend a serious rift within the Fed.
Mr. Olson, a commercial banker by profession, has focused primarily on bank regulation and has rarely taken strong stands on macroeconomic policy.
"If under these circumstances the F.O.M.C.
is prepared to keep going, then this means that the committee is more worried about the longer-term risk of higher inflation than the shorter-term risk of a collapse in growth."

In the first two weeks after Hurricane Katrina, many Wall Street analysts speculated that the Fed would either pause in raising rates or signal that the process would end fairly soon.

Historically, the central bank has taken a dim view of changing policy in response to a natural disaster, even a big one.
Fed officials, and many economists, contend that the economic impact of such calamities is usually local and usually temporary.

The normal pattern is for the economy to slow and for unemployment to rise in the immediate aftermath.
But any slowdown is usually followed by an even bigger jump in economic activity as rebuilding begins.
The big uncertainty this month is whether Hurricane Katrina, which disabled major oil refineries and offshore drilling platforms, will cause a more enduring downturn.

But the Fed, which has been raising the cost of borrowing since June 2004, showed little appetite for a "wait and see" approach.
It also noted that "higher energy prices and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures."

Most important, it repeated phrases suggesting that money remains too cheap for comfort.
It said the prospects for inflation and growth are "roughly equal."
It implied that monetary policy is still "accommodative," meaning that interest rates are not yet back to a "neutral" level that allows growth without inflation.
And it repeated its expectation about raising rates at a "pace that is likely to be measured."

Both the hurricane damage and higher energy prices amount to a "supply shock" that leads to higher costs.
By keeping interest rates low, the Fed would be stoking consumer demand and possibly driving prices up even higher.

"There's not really anything you can do about a supply shock, other than repair the damage," Mr. Harris said.
"As a policy maker you have to be very careful about putting a lot of stimulus into the economy at a time when capacity has been impaired."
Analysts continue to debate among themselves about how much more the Fed will raise rates.
Most now predict that it will raise them a quarter-point at each of its two remaining meetings this year, in October and December, which would take the federal funds rate to 4.25 percent.
In its statement, the Fed conceded that inflation remains mild and that higher energy prices have yet to drive other prices higher.

But Fed officials are increasingly concerned that low interest rates have fueled too much speculation in housing and too much complacency among investors toward risk.
"Europe's citizens do not seem convinced that the bitter medicine of continued structural reforms will cure the stasis that afflicts much of the Continent," said Raghuram Rajan, the fund's director of research.
"It is a failure of politics that people have not come to see that the more they want to retain the attractive European way of life, the more the way they work will have to change."

Over all, the report predicted that American economic growth would slow to 3.3 percent in 2006 from about 3.5 percent this year.
The economies of the 12 nations that use the euro as a common currency will expand only 1.8 percent next year, the report predicted, up from 1.2 percent in 2005.
With signs that Japan's long battle with deflation is nearly over, and consumption rising, the fund said that Japan's economy is likely to expand by 2 percent next year.
Six months ago, it predicted that Japan would have no growth.

President Bush and Republicans in Congress have begun to propose spending cuts to offset part of the hurricane and flood costs.
But administration officials continued Wednesday to call for making Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent, which would cost at least $1.4 trillion over 10 years, and they oppose proposals to delay the start of the Medicare drug program, which is expected to cost about $45 billion a year.

Though such loans have appropriate uses, he continued, they could also provide a way for marginally qualified buyers to borrow heavily and buy homes at inflated prices.
"In the event of widespread cooling in house prices, these borrowers, and the institutions that service them, could be exposed to significant losses," he continued.

Mr. Greenspan's message on Monday was twofold: first, that the use of exotic new mortgages could be aggravating the run-up in prices and inducing some families to take on too much risk; second, that the finances of most households are still on solid ground.
With only a few months left before he is scheduled to retire in January, Mr. Greenspan seemed intent on defending his legacy against critics who contend that the Fed's policy of keeping interest rates low contributed to a speculative fever in the housing market.

Citing new data collected by the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan noted that there was little correlation between states with the biggest increases in prices and states with the highest concentrations of multiple loans, called "piggy back" loans, that allow people to borrow almost the entire purchase price of a home.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
According to the Fed data, the five states where piggy-back loans were particularly common this year were Texas, California, Utah, Oregon and Colorado.
While prices in California have climbed faster than in almost any other state, those in the other four states did not climb faster than average.
Indeed, the size of the mortgage as a share of the total purchase price tends to be lower in states with the most rapid price appreciation.
The reason, Mr. Greenspan hypothesized, is that people in torrid markets like Southern California are selling houses as well as buying them.

By any measure, American homeowners have taken on far more debt in the last few years.
The total amount of outstanding household debt climbed at an annual rate of more than 17 percent in the first half of this year and an average annual rate of 16.4 percent over the previous four years, according to an analysis of Fed data by the Federal Markets Center, a nonprofit research organization in Virginia.
The amount of cash that people pulled out of their homes by refinancing their mortgages was equal to about 5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product last year, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.
Mr. Greenspan predicted on Monday that savings would climb again when interest rates rise and the housing market cools.
Many analysts agree, but caution that spending could slow at the same time.
Many in this region say they resent the American assumption that, given the chance, everyone would live like Americans.

Correction Appended
"Property Taxes Are Outrageous" is a 30-second commercial for Douglas R. Forrester, the Republican nominee for New Jersey governor, that began running this week on network television stations in Philadelphia and New York City.
PRODUCERS -- Stevens, Reed, Curcio & Potholm.
ON THE SCREEN -- The ad alternates between shots of beleaguered New Jersey residents pleading for property tax relief and a buoyant Mr. Forrester, consoling clean-cut families outside their modest (and, no doubt, highly taxed) suburban homes.
Some of those who appear in the ad were also featured in a previous commercial about Democratic voters crossing party lines to support Mr. Forrester -- although one Democratic defector depicted in the earlier ad, who was later revealed to be a former Essex County employee fired for taking money -- does not make a return appearance.
At one point, the narrator discusses Mr. Forrester's Democratic opponent, Senator Jon S. Corzine, and the bright colors are suddenly replaced by a jarring black and white photo of Mr. Corzine with his hand extended and a graphic that reads "Corzine raised taxes 133 times."
THE SCRIPT -- Several people are shown, each delivering a brief message: Property taxes are outrageous.
I'm fed up with the high property taxes.
Only Doug Forrester has a plan to cut property taxes 30 percent in three years.
More relief for more people, that's the Forrester plan.
Jon Corzine?
He's voted 133 times for higher taxes.
Corzine won't change New Jersey.
Doug Forrester will.
I'm a Democrat who's voting for Doug Forrester.
We need Doug Forrester.
ACCURACY -- Few homeowners would dispute that New Jersey's property taxes, the highest in the nation, are outrageous.
Since then, Democrats have seized on the same criticisms of Mr. Forrester's proposal: that it is based on dubious economic assumptions, would only provide a temporary drop in property taxes and would require big and as-yet-unspecified cuts in spending to avoid a multibillion-dollar deficit.
Mr. Forrester's contention that Mr. Corzine cast 133 votes to raise taxes is misleading.
The ad also neglects to mention that as mayor of West Windsor 20 years ago, Mr. Forrester doubled property taxes.
SCORECARD -- Republicans are so badly outnumbered and outgunned in New Jersey that it is shrewd of Mr. Forrester's campaign to use testimonials from Democrats to appeal for crossover voters and pre-empt criticism that the Republican candidate's attack on Mr. Corzine is partisan.
Despite its factual problems, this ad taps into frustration over property taxes to neatly encapsulate Mr. Forrester's essential pitch to weary and independent-minded voters: that he is the candidate most likely to bring change.
(The error also appeared in two articles on Sept. 29 analyzing specific ads.)
"Relying on policy makers to perceive when speculative asset bubbles have developed and then to implement timely policies to address successfully these misalignments in asset prices is simply not realistic," he said, adding that "we at the Fed were uncomfortable with a stock market that appeared as early as 1996 to disconnect from its moorings."

Transcripts of Fed meetings do show that, but they also show that by the time the bubble really started to expand, the talk of stocks in Fed meetings dealt mostly with how much impact the rising stock market was having on consumption.
Perhaps thinking of the Dow Jones industrial average, he pointed to "the fact the stock market is unchanged over the past six months" as evidence that the Fed's rate increases were starting to have some impact on the economy.

All told, you can secure your records in a weekend afternoon.
Even better, doing all this has a wonderful side effect: it can put you in better financial shape to survive a disaster because you will end up a lot smarter about how you spend and save money.
For instance, one of the first things to do is compile a list of where everything is -- account numbers and the locations of important documents.
The list will help you or anyone in your family locate things you need for the insurance adjuster or relief worker.
(The New York Times Web site, www.nytimes.com/yourmoney, has a template for this information that you can place right on your computer.)

This is really the "if hit by a bus" list that financial planners have been recommending you compile for your heirs.
If you think of the list that way, you will be reminded of your mortality and you will not want to write it.
But think of the families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita or by California wildfires, and the psychological barrier collapses.
The list becomes a much easier sell now, said Brent Neiser, a director for the National Endowment for Financial Education.
"It forces you to think," he said.
Here is what else you have to do to protect your records and yourself:
RECORD: Once you have made your basic list, save it on a U.S.B.
flash drive.
A 256-megabyte drive, which you can buy for $20 or even less if you catch a store promotion, gives you enough space for that file and all the other suggestions mentioned below.
Several of the big flash drive makers, like SanDisk and Lexar Media, are now selling more advanced drives that allow you to encrypt the data so others cannot read it without knowing the alphanumeric key that unlocks the code.
Some are even shock proofed with heavier rubber and plastic coatings.
Those will cost about $10 to $20 more, but are certainly worth it when you consider the sensitivity of the data on them.

It is also a good idea to copy the contents onto additional drives for backup and for other members of the family.

BONUS: When you are listing the credit cards, also note the credit limits so you will know how much you could spend in an emergency.
If your credit cards are at their limits now, you are not going to have any cushion to fall back on.
So start paying off balances, beginning with the card carrying the highest interest rate.

If you do not have a scanner or a printer with a flat scanner, take the pile of documents down to a copy center like Kinko's to scan.
Record the image files on the U.S.B.
drive.

With homes appreciating in value, you may also find you need to increase coverage.

You will never do it.
But creating a detailed inventory of everything you own need not be a major chore when technology comes to the rescue.
Many households now have a camcorder or digital camera.
Walk around each room and take a picture of each item.
Then, either store all the photos on a memory card (unless you live in the Biltmore mansion, you can load all the photos on a 256- or 512-megabyte card).
Or you can transfer them to the same U.S.B.
drive with your other documents.
Describe each object on the camcorder soundtrack or in the file name of the digital photo.
Make an extra copy on another card or drive.

PERSONAL BUSINESS: YOUR MONEY E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com
The networks, sensing a new revenue stream as traditional advertising spending flattens out, are actively pursuing these steroid-enhanced product placement deals.
Advertising companies -- from Omnicom to MediaVest to Carat Americas -- have started their own branded entertainment divisions to solidify their relationships with their corporate clients, as well as the cash that comes with them.
Newcomers like Madison Road Entertainment have popped up to match the desires of Hollywood and marketers and perhaps create their own shows in the process.
And producers see in these more sophisticated plugs a way to offset rising production costs.

Not everyone is thrilled with the trend.
Some creators of television shows worry that the mercantile impulse could turn storytellers into shills and keep more provocative fare off the big networks.
Last Tuesday in New York during what is known as Advertising Week, television writers protested outside a panel about branded entertainment, demanding more say in any such deals as well as a cut in the profits from them.
And the Federal Communications Commission has turned a wary eye on a practice it sees as little more than stealth advertising.
But many producers, network executives and advertisers dismiss such criticisms as overblown.
"The fact is brands are part of our lives and brands exist in these television environments, so why not showcase them?"
said Ben Silverman, chief executive of Reveille, whose shows include "The Office" as well as reality shows like "Biggest Loser" on NBC and "Nashville Star" on USA.
"Otherwise, brands will go spend their dollars on Google, and the F.C.C.
ain't going to be able to do anything."
IN some ways, this newfangled form of branded entertainment harks back to the beginnings of television.
Half a century ago, ad agencies often produced shows like "The Colgate Comedy Hour" and "Texaco Star Theater," in which a chorus line of dapper gas-station attendants opened each show by singing the Texaco jingle ("Oh, we're the men of Texaco, we work from Maine to Mexico") before introducing the host, Milton Berle.

A combination of rising production costs and quiz-show scandals pushed the sponsors out of the show-making business by the late 1950's, and the era of the 30-second ad began.
Corporations would barter their wares to television as well as feature films, hoping that the glamour of Hollywood would rub off on their quotidian products.

Sometimes, serendipity would strike, and a brand like Junior Mints would end up lodged in the nation's collective consciousness.
No advertiser approached the creators of "Seinfeld" to suggest a 1993 episode in which Kramer and Jerry watch helplessly as a Junior Mint falls into the body cavity of Elaine's former boyfriend during an operation.
By selling sponsorships to advertisers, Mr. Burnett was able to finance much if not all of his show, easing the way for a network -- in this case, CBS -- to put it on the air without much financial risk.
And because success in television is always accompanied by swarms of imitators, the networks latched on to this low-cost programming model.
Despite the fervent wishes of many television critics, reality shows -- about everything from C-list celebrities ("The Surreal Life") to ballroom dancers ("Dancing With the Stars") to backbiting businesspeople ("The Apprentice") -- still clog the broadcast and cable networks.
And they are shamelessly stuffed to bursting with brand tie-ins; indeed, whole episodes can revolve around a product.

During the 2004-2005 television season, more than 100,000 product placements appeared on the six broadcast networks, an increase of nearly 28 percent from the previous season, according to Nielsen Media Research.
And in 2004, the value of overall TV product placements rose 46.4 percent, to $1.88 billion, according to the research firm PQ Media.

More are on the way, particularly in scripted shows.
Leslie Moonves, co-president and co-chief operating officer of Viacom and chairman of CBS, has predicted in recent months that there will be a "quantum leap" in the number of product placements and that within one or two years, nearly every show on network television will have them.
Last month, CBS digitally embedded the logo of the Chevrolet Impala in the scenery of five of its shows, including "CSI."
This headlong embrace, paradoxically, comes at a time when the average household watches more television than ever, according to a report released on Thursday by Nielsen.
Yet the financial moorings of the television industry have never been subject to such pressure.

With so many entertainment choices, audience fragmentation continues apace, and advertisers are none too pleased to be paying the same or higher ad rates for shows that are losing viewers.
At the same time, technology has given viewers a degree of control over their television -- and commercial -- watching.
Digital video recorders may be in fewer than 10 million households now, but marketers are already preparing for the day when many more viewers are likely to skip right past their 30-second ads.
Major marketers like Procter & Gamble and Unilever have cut their television ad budgets and put more into product placement.
For the networks and the studios and producers who create the shows, that is ominous.
"The advertising model of 10 years ago is not applicable today," said Bruce Rosenblum, president of Warner Brothers Television Group, which oversees both the WB and the television studio.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"At the end of the day," he added, "if we are unable to satisfy advertisers' appetites to deliver messages in new ways to the viewer, then we're destined to have a broken model."
No template exists for these more elaborate product placement deals, according to interviews with more than two dozen advertisers, network executives, branded-entertainment principals and producers.
But in most cases, the advertisers gain a say and, occasionally, veto power over how the product is portrayed.

In return, an advertiser will end up buying more ordinary 30-second ads than it did previously, as well as paying a separate integration fee to the network, which splits the money with the studio.
That bounty can rise into the millions of dollars, said Mr. Silverman of Reveille.
Or it can help a network keep ad dollars that might have gone to other shows or media.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Sometimes, instead of an integration fee, advertisers will include the show in their marketing efforts, such as mall promotions, magazine ads and newspaper stuffers -- much to the networks' delight.
"Network dollars are tight.
If I get a promotion, that's a big thing for me," said Joe Davola, president of Tollin/Robbins Television, which produces such shows as "Inconceivable" on NBC as well as the WB's "What I Like About You," "Smallville" and "One Tree Hill."
The challenges and contests in reality shows readily lend themselves to brand integration, executives said.
Starving, thirsty islanders will gobble and guzzle Doritos and Mountain Dew after vanquishing their opponents in a "Survivor" episode, and the viewer will usually accept the products' presence.

But scripted shows are a trickier endeavor.
"When a marketer uses branded entertainment to actually sell a product, the entire exercise will fail," said Jak Severson, chief executive of Madison Road Entertainment.
"Audiences are so sophisticated today the last thing they will do is sit and be sold to during an entertainment show."

Jonathan Prince, creator of the recently canceled "American Dreams," is now working with Madison Road; he is one of the most aggressive in weaving brands into his story lines.
"I had seen too much bad product placement, with someone driving a car, holding a soda," he said.
"It felt like a commercial -- and advertisers already do that well."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr.
Prince added, "The ones that work are the ones that grow out of character."
Prince already had an idea to portray the deviousness of a character, Patty, who is a junior high school student.
Colleen Milway, global media director for the Campbell Soup Company, said the story line fit the squeaky-clean image the company wants for the brand.
And by eschewing the obvious approach -- characters chirping "Mmm, Mmm, Mmm Good," for example -- the integration appeared to work.

"The needle we have to thread is to have a brand integration that is effective enough to have resonance, but -- and it's a big but -- subtle enough so that it doesn't offend," said Mr.
Prince.
Arbitrariness does not help.
Measuring a product placement's effectiveness -- the domain of companies like iTVX and IAG Research -- is still an inexact science.
But as with all new fads in the media business, bad money is likely to tumble alongside the good.

"I'm sure there will be integration that will make people cringe," said Robert Riesenberg, president and chief executive of Full Circle Entertainment, a television production company owned by Omnicom.
"But over all," he added, "content is going to be governed by taste, by people's desire to engage with television."

The industry is ultimately self-regulating; turn off the viewers, and there won't be a show left to cram with dissonant brand integrations.
Producers and network executives also caution that they need to police themselves, to refrain from grabbing dollars willy-nilly.
While ABC has not instituted a quota -- and the Sears connection with "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" has been well received -- executives there said they would have a difficult time doing more than one or two a week.
"As soon you as you start ramping up the volume, quality starts to suffer," said Dan Longest, senior vice president of integrated marketing at ABC.

For Chrysler, that tacit approval by a character in a scripted show validated its attempts to portray the Chrysler 300 as a hot car.
"That's very valuable to us," said Jeff Bell, vice president of Chrysler and Jeep.
But, Mr. Bell said, "It's better than a salesman's solicitation."
Producers like Mr. Wells have the clout to pick and choose, and Dick Wolf can keep his three "Law & Order" series free of product placement if he wants.
But some in the television industry fret that those with less successful track records or at smaller networks will not be able to fend off aggressive marketers.

Also worrisome is the tendency of advertisers who are creating brand integrations to gravitate toward heartwarming shows like NBC's "Three Wishes," in which the singer Amy Grant ladles out assistance to those in need.
"It's got to be noncontroversial," said Mr. Riesenberg of Full Circle, whose productions include "Bound for Glory" on ESPN (with Mr. Silverman's Reveille); the show follows the former football star Dick Butkus as he tries to turn around a high school football team.

"People who pay the bills get to write notes," he said, but that does not mean a producer has to consent to every brand integration idea.
To him, the advertisers are the saviors of scripted television.
"'Desperate Housewives' doesn't need a savior.
'Lost' doesn't need a savior," he said.
"It's the middling-rated, expensive, quality shows that network people want to keep on the air, but to them the model doesn't make sense."
Branded integration schemes also face some other foes, like Jonathan S. Adelstein, a commissioner at the F.C.C.
"Whether it's classic payola, where a radio station gets a large plasma television to play a certain song, or a corporation pays $100,000 to get its product mentioned on the air, both the station and the network are required by law to disclose that," Mr. Adelstein said.
The networks do disclose promotional considerations.
But Mr. Adelstein says the credits whip by so fast that the human eye cannot read them, even with a DVR.
"Is that full and fair disclosure?
I don't think so," he said.
"We need to make sure people are sure they're being sold to."

For Mr. Davola of Tollin/Robbins, the benefits of branded integration outweigh any hypothetical downside.
"If people get insulted, they can go watch PBS or go rent an independent movie," he said.
"Seriously.
This is the real world.
I'm not ruining television."

The cooling off has forced both sellers and real estate agents to begin changing their attitudes about residential property, many said.

Houses that are priced too high are sometimes on the market for weeks or months now, rather than fetching even more money than their owners had imagined they could get.

Still, the average sales price was 10 percent higher this summer than it was a year earlier, according to the study.
But the changes that real estate agents have seen in recent weeks -- increased inventories and longer sales times -- have often preceded market slowdowns in the past.

Time is short: the Senate will be busy with the confirmation hearings of Harriet E. Miers for associate justice of the Supreme Court, and is expected to adjourn for the year in early December.
Mr. Greenspan's term expires on Jan. 31, and he has signaled that he wants to step down on schedule.
Although the Senate banking committee could begin hearings in January, Congress usually does not reconvene until the end of that month.
Mr. Bush has made it clear he wants to pick a candidate with whom he has some personal rapport, as he did in nominating Ms. Miers, a White House counsel and a long-time associate, for the Supreme Court.
But he also wants to choose someone who provides reassurance to the nation's financial markets, and Wall Street power brokers want someone who understands capital markets as well as monetary policy.
But while President Bush expressed admiration in 2001 for Mr. Rubin, who is now chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup, Mr. Rubin's strong support for John Kerry in the last election and his criticism of Mr. Bush's budget deficits have made him unthinkable to Republican leaders.

Fed officials have become increasingly uneasy about rising budget deficits, particularly when federal spending tied to Hurricane Katrina shot past $60 billion last month and now appears set to rise well past $100 billion.
If the central bank fears that federal borrowing is provoking higher inflation, the next Fed chairman will face pressure to slow the economy by raising interest rates.

Mr. Bernanke is a highly respected monetary economist and a former governor at the Federal Reserve.
Many Wall Street analysts say he would be well received by investors.
But Mr. Bernanke is still something of an unknown quantity to Mr. Bush.
Mr. Bush's nominee for the next Fed chairman is in many ways as important as his nominations for justices to the Supreme Court.
With its sway over the nation's money supply and its ability to set short-term interest rates, the Federal Reserve directly affects the nation's rate of economic growth, its pace of job creation and its rate of inflation.

If Mr. Bush wants the Senate to confirm a new chairman before Congress adjourns this year, he would almost certainly have to nominate that person by early November.

But Mr. Lindsey has little support among current or former Fed officials, or from many people on Wall Street.

People close to the administration said the move was intended to give Mr. Bush a chance to become more familiar with Mr. Bernanke, who is a Republican but who had been a professor at Princeton University with almost no experience in party politics before moving to the White House.
Unlike nominations to the Supreme Court, the impending nomination of a new Fed chairman has stirred almost no ideological battle.
The Fed's policy making committee has always included both Democrats and Republicans, and the disagreements almost never coincide with party affiliations.
Under Mr. Greenspan, Fed policy makers are sharply divided about whether the Fed should set a public target for inflation.
Mr. Greenspan, a Republican, has been firmly opposed.
Governor Donald Kohn, a Democrat and a career Fed official, is also opposed.

At issue is the collaboration of the two biggest credit card companies, Visa USA and MasterCard International, in setting the so-called interchange fee charged to merchants by the banks processing a transaction.
The plaintiffs contend that setting the interchange fees violates federal antitrust law, while the defendants -- the credit card companies as well as several large banks in some of the cases -- disagree.
Not only are the fees legal, the credit card companies maintain, they make up only a portion of the total cost that merchants pay for processing credit cards.
Additionally, said Eileen Simon, MasterCard's associate general counsel, the credit card companies lack monopoly power in the market "because other types of payment -- such as cash, checks and other types of payment cards -- are available."
These complaints are shaping up as the most significant challenge to the credit card industry since Visa and MasterCard agreed in 2003 to a $3 billion settlement of a class-action lawsuit spearheaded by Wal-Mart and Sears that accused them of forcing merchants to accept debit cards.

It therefore owns no big integrated energy companies, preferring companies that provide services for the big companies.
"There's a dire need for exploration and production," he said, "so the service companies should do well over the next couple of years no matter what happens to oil prices."

One example is Weatherford International, based in Houston.
Weatherford provides equipment and services to energy drillers and producers.
"It's one of the best companies in the industry and it's got the wind at its back," he said.
"Before Hurricane Katrina, given a normal winter, there would be a national gas shortage," Mr. D'Alonzo said.
"But the hurricanes did significant damage to gas drillers in the gulf and will continue to push prices up."
Another winner was Coventry Health Care, a managed-care company in Bethesda, Md.. Coventry acquires other health maintenance organizations and managed health care plans around the country, and then brings in its own management to revamp operations and increase profits, Mr. D'Alonzo said.

Lincoln, which is based in Philadelphia, reported earnings of $707 million on revenue of $5.4 billion last year.

Last fall, Mr. Boscia signaled his intention to use acquisitions to move Lincoln up from the unheralded range of midsize companies.
After the merger, Lincoln, which is already a leader in the sale of variable annuities (a combination of mutual funds and insurance), would rise in a merger from 16th to 12th in the rankings of American insurance companies, with $121 billion in assets, according to the A.M. Best Company, a rating agency.
A merger would also put Lincoln in fifth place after Prudential Financial in the sale of life insurance, and raise it to fifth place after MetLife in the rankings for sales of fixed annuities, which provide a modest but steady return without taxation until the savings are withdrawn.

Industry specialists said a deal with Jefferson could add stability to Lincoln's earnings, which are volatile because of its emphasis on variable annuities and their fluctuations in the stock market.
But the specialists said that Jefferson's heavy lineup of sluggish and, at the moment, underperforming fixed annuities and traditional life insurance could also slow the pace of Lincoln's growth.
Even after a merger with Jefferson, Lincoln would lag far behind the giants of life insurance in size.
Analysts estimate the assets of MetLife, the largest of the companies focusing on life insurance, at more than $400 billion.
And Lincoln and Jefferson would have a combined market value of $15.5 billion, compared with $36.6 billion for MetLife.

Both Lincoln and Jefferson, the industry specialists said, have posted shrinking earnings on fixed annuities and traditional life insurance as interest rates have fallen.
The insurers aimed to earn much more by investing the premiums they received for the annuities and life insurance.
But lower market interest rates have made that impossible.

Industry specialists said Jefferson Pilot had been looking for a merger partner for more than three years because its earnings have been stagnant and its ability to compete has been limited by its smaller size.

Mr. Bennett was freed on a bond of $50 million, including $5 million in cash.
At the bail hearing, a federal prosecutor, David Esseks, called Mr. Bennett, who is a British citizen, a flight risk, saying that Mr. Bennett was heard on tape on Monday telling a colleague that "he was going to Europe in 48 hours, and that's what prompted us to act as quickly as we did," according to Bloomberg News.
Riding a global boom in futures and derivatives trading, Refco has become one of the largest global clearing firms for derivatives.
The firm, based in New York, acts as a broker, buying and selling futures, commodities, government securities and other option products.

Refco currently has $642 million outstanding on a $800 million loan originally underwritten by Bank of America and Deutsche Bank.
That loan has been syndicated.
The banks are expected to meet later this week with the company, an executive briefed on the discussions said.
Banks lend money to corporations based on the soundness of their financial statements.
Since Refco has confirmed that its statements as far back as 2002 cannot be relied upon, banks can call their loans or credit facilities.
It does not appear at this time that they will do so.

In one example of how the arrangement worked, Refco Capital Markets, a subsidiary of Refco, lent a Refco customer $335 million on Feb. 23, 2005, authorities say.

According to the complaint, Refco engaged in similar transactions over the quarters that ended in March 2005, November 2004 and August 2004.
Refco lent as much as $545 million to the customer to offset the debt by Mr. Bennett's company.

"Those loans allowed RGHI to temporarily eliminate its debt to Refco as of the end of these quarterly reporting periods, replacing those debts with debts from the customer and allowing Mr. Bennett to hide the related-party nature of the continuing indebtedness by RGHI to Refco," the complaint says.
William Terrence Pigott, manager of Liberty Corner Capital Strategies, the entity believed to be involved in Mr. Bennett's transactions, runs a series of investment funds.
Mr. Pigott set the funds up in 1999 after leaving Daiwa America, where he managed a portfolio of bond investments, according to a person with access to marketing documents for various Liberty Corner entities.

Mr. Bennett's personal ties to the hedge fund remain unclear.
Shares of Refco have now fallen 62 percent since the company's first disclosure on Monday.
In hindsight, investors might have been wary after an unusual disclosure in Refco's regulatory filings for its public offering.
The firm lacked an adequate finance staff to manage the documentation associated with being a public company and the firm lacked procedures for "closing its books" or preparing for the I.P.O.
Refco had to use an outside firm to help it, which is rare.
The complaint's contention that Mr. Bennett hid the $545 million loan provides some cover to the banks, which include Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs, and Banc of America Securities.
"And reasonable due diligence entails, among other things, investigating Refco's current and past relationships with banks, creditors and competitors, communicating with key company officials, examining the company's regulatory problems and how they solved them, and examining any material litigation involving the company, its contracts and minutes of board meetings."
For example, the difference in the yields of Treasury securities maturing in two years and those coming due in 10 years -- known as the spread -- stood at 13 basis points last Thursday.

Some traders said that the mild response to the Refco mess may have been partly a result of reduced transactions yesterday because of the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
Trading activity was reduced, for example, at interdealer brokerage firms that match buyers and sellers of fixed-income securities and that clear their trades through Refco.
According to a list compiled by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, a provider of settlement and clearance services for stocks, bonds and derivatives, some of the interdealer firms that Refco Securities clears for are Chapdelaine Corporate Securities & Company, Seaboard Securities and Rafferty Capital Markets.

A number of companies like Toll's have, over the past few years, transformed the American home into a corporate product -- probably the last item in our $11 trillion economy that has yet to be marketed and branded on a national scale to consumers.
At the moment, one in four new homes in the United States is built by a large publicly traded home builder, but this ratio will probably change significantly.
Several Wall Street analysts and most of the big home builders seem confident that their companies will be responsible for half of all new homes in the United States within 10 years and perhaps more (as the industry consolidates).
In the meantime, as builders like Toll consider the effects of a cooling real-estate market, they remain students of the steady, inexorable force of America's population growth.
Where (and how) will the next generation of Americans live?
And how much will they pay?
The big builders need to know, because they intend to build those places.
A look at their land reserves gives you a sense of their grand intentions.
At the moment, Toll controls enough land for nearly 80,000 houses.
Its competitors, which tend to build lower-priced houses on smaller lots, have even larger accumulations.
K. Hovnanian has land for more than 100,000 houses.
Pulte Homes holds 350,000 sites.
Still others -- Lennar, Centex Homes, D. R. Horton, KB Home -- control hundreds of thousands as well.
And all of them are in ferocious pursuit of more.

Builders by their very nature are optimistic, and to regard the real-estate market as they do is to see a future that depends not on the short-term fate of the Florida and California condominium markets but on the long-term supply of land.
That supply shapes the priorities of businessmen like Toll.
They ponder where it will lead them to build in 5 or 10 years.
And they consider the relationship between supply and the latest home-building statistics and economic indicators.
Right now, there are about 34 million rented apartments and 74 million owner-occupied homes in the U.S.
Enormous as these numbers may appear, in many metro areas, not just Las Vegas, the turnover of existing stock has not been able to accommodate the demand from immigrants, arrivals from out-of-state, expanding families and Americans in search of a second home for vacation or retirement.
For the past few years, nearly 20 percent of single-family-home buyers have been purchasing newly constructed houses.
Some builders turned to infill housing, looking to old industrial spaces or unused urban lots to satisfy demand.
For the most part, though, they have plotted new communities farther and farther outside of cities, their handiwork visible in the archipelagoes of freshly minted neighborhoods that have arisen along the traffic corridors on both coasts and now ring the outskirts of every thriving city in the United States.
All told, the home-building industry has constructed about 13.5 million single-family homes since the mid-1990's; last year alone, single-family "starts" numbered about 1.6 million, a new record.
In historical terms, our recent boom rivals, and in many regards outpaces, the frenzied building of the early 1950's.
David Seiders, the chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, told me in early October that the industry still expects to set another record this year, even as the industry begins to hit "the plateau we've been watching and waiting for."
As Bob Toll would say, builders need an awful lot of ground to plot so much housing.
And if there is a simple mathematical equation that defines this work, it's that newly bought land plus a plan for development equals some amount of resistance in the form of political opposition.
In recent years, the difficulty of getting things built has made business harder for small, local builders and easier for big companies, with their greater resources, to gain control of the housing market.
"The large builders have taken the position: we're just going to fight," Chris Mayer, a housing economist at Columbia University's business school, says. "
'We have lawyers, we have experts, we have money, we're going to buy these tracts of land and fight it out' " -- that, according to Mayer, is their position.
"That has proven very time-consuming.
But the local builder who used to have the benefit of knowing the local people -- that has become far less important than the ability of the big builders to fight the current regulatory environment."
As Mayer points out, virtually every state in the country now has policies to restrain developers.
No matter the region, he says, the small developer is at a tremendous disadvantage.
And in buying local building companies, many big builders have found a simple and unobtrusive way to enter into new regions and metro areas.

Toll Brothers is a creature of this revolution.
He never imagined, however, that he would be able to expand nationwide as quickly as he has.
Now it's up to five years.
He estimates that New York, California and Massachusetts take a similar amount of time.
Even Florida and Virginia -- traditionally easy places to build -- can require a year or two.
"I don't denigrate Nimby, by the way.

His experience with Nimby opposition, Toll added, leads him to believe that the political resistance to land development around the country will get more intense in the coming years.
Indeed, Toll seemed certain that firms like his -- with an expertise at finding and developing land -- would become increasingly successful.
The company expects to grow by 20 percent for the next two years and then will strive for 15 percent annually after that.
Those estimates suggest that the company's expected production of around 8,600 houses this year will expand to at least 15,000 houses by 2010.
Individual Toll developments now range in size from a few dozen to 3,000 houses.

Of course, there's more to the economics of the housing market than the supply of land.
Demand can be influenced by everything from higher interest rates, which can disqualify hundreds of thousands of potential home buyers, to a region's rate of job creation, which can determine the pool of potential buyers.
Regional wage growth -- are workers' salaries rising in step with house prices?
-- still matters.
Serendipity can play a part, too.
The slackening demand for homes in autumn would drop more drastically if the larger economy were to slip into a recession.
Or it could drop, as the Yale economist Robert Shiller has pointed out, if investors lose their "irrationally exuberant" conviction (unjustified by historical data, in his view) that their homes will undoubtedly appreciate for the foreseeable future.
Demand could also weaken in the wake of a large terrorist attack.
And what if the price of gas, already reaching record levels after Katrina, hits $8 a gallon?
Will anyone still want to live in a new development 50 miles from his job?
None of these contingencies shake the faith of the big, publicly held builders.
Indeed, many are adamant that the tightening supply of land in many metro areas, as well as long-term demographic trends, augur an American future that works to their advantage.
Toll Brothers, which has a specific niche in the luxury market, sees additional opportunity in the wealth of many next-generation homeowners.
In conversation, Bob Toll laments a government that seems intent on "the creation of more wealth for the wealthy"; he even calls attention to a rising American "oligopoly."
Yet his company, whose average home now sells for $665,000 -- more than twice what any other national home builder gets -- owes much to the growth of the affluent class.
The company's promotional literature calls attention to the fact that the number of households with incomes of more than $100,000 is growing six times as fast as that of all U.S. households.
Toll Brothers doesn't merely profit from the growing income gap; it owes its very existence to it.
In the past couple of years, Toll and his deputies have begun analyzing European housing data to see if they hold any lessons for a maturing American housing market.
Toll has been talking up the research to stock analysts and the financial press for the past year.
His conclusions carry a whiff of new-paradigm thinking, but he nevertheless seems convinced that Europe's present-day reality is America's destiny.
I asked Toll what our children -- my kids are both under 8, I told him -- would be paying when they're ready to buy.
"They're going to live with us until they're 40," Toll said matter-of-factly.
"And when they have their second kid, then we'll finally kick them out and make them pay for the house that we paid for.
And that house will cost them 45 to 50 percent of their income."

I grew alarmed.
Was he kidding?
"It's all just logic," Toll said.
"In Britain you pay seven times your annual income for a home; in the U.S. you pay three and a half."
The British get 330 square feet, per person, in their homes; in the U.S., we get 750 square feet.
Not only does Toll say he believes the next generation of buyers will be paying twice as much of their annual incomes; in terms of space, he also seems to think they're going to get only half as much.
"And that average, million-dollar insane home in the burbs?
It's going to be $4 million."
Barzilay checks in regularly with the men to see if they've encountered construction or operational problems at any of the current 230 Toll developments they oversee; he also uses the meetings to encourage these managers to exchange information.
The average customer spends $103,000 on special extras like additional bathrooms and prime locations, and Barzilay is mindful of the possibility that a new brass faucet that succeeds in Arizona can succeed in Michigan.
Basement recreation rooms migrated from the Northeast down to Dallas; second staircases have gone from Pennsylvania to Maryland; capacious "bonus rooms" above or abutting the garage have moved from Charlotte, N.C., where they were common, to communities north of the Mason-Dixon and west of the Mississippi.
Barzilay finished the meeting by insisting that the men work harder chasing ground.
The reigning philosophy at Toll seems to be that the company needs to step up its land acquisitions, even though its current reserves should be enough for six or seven years of building.
Barzilay insists that his vice presidents do anything necessary to find acreage, even examine satellite photography (using Google Earth, for example).
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
He and Toll have structured the company in an entrepreneurial fashion -- each vice president responsible for building communities in particular territories is also charged with finding more ground.
Doug Yearley, for instance, a senior vice president who takes a seat at Barzilay's weekly meeting, oversees Toll developments in New Jersey, South Carolina and several Midwestern states.
Yearley is very much a believer that the company can never have too much ground.
"In any region, we make sure we're fully connected with all the brokers, with all the planners, with all the lawyers," he told me.
"We let them know that we are desperately looking for more land.
We put ads in the paper; we have sections in our Web site asking, 'Do you have land?'
We assign territories to land-acquisition managers, and that's all they do."
If someone on Yearley's land-acquisition team is in charge of three counties, he has to know every piece of land in every desirable town in each of those counties.
He has to know every elected official.
He has to carry around a color-coded map of every town in his or her area so as to know where sewer lines and power lines run, since both can determine the viability of any potential subdivision.
"Every parcel that's more than 50 acres that has not been developed," Yearley added, "has to be identified."
In urban areas it can be even smaller.
Toll Brothers usually options a piece of land rather than buying it outright; this enables the company to back out of a deal if a township refuses to provide the clearances needed to build.
(Once Toll gets the permits and is ready to break ground, it buys a parcel outright.)
But sometimes the firm works in other ways.
In the early 1990's, for example, Yearley became aware of defaulted loans being auctioned off by the federal government as a result of widespread savings-and-loan failures.
West Windsor's biggest claim to fame may be that Orson Welles broadcast his "War of the Worlds" radio show in 1938 from a theater in town.

If there is a place that predicts the future of American housing development, it would be New Jersey, which happens to be the first state that Toll Brothers expanded into from the Philadelphia environs in the early 1980's.
In those days, the permit process in the state -- the time it takes a developer to get a parcel approved by a municipality to start building -- took about a year or two.
It currently takes up to seven or eight.
And that's only once Toll can get its hands on a parcel.
More and more land in New Jersey is being taken out of the development cycle, placed off-limits to preserve open space and wetlands, for instance, or zoned into seven-acre lots by affluent suburbs in an effort to dissuade builders from constructing subdivisions with any real density (and thus any real profits).
"That doesn't exist anymore.
There aren't even many 200-acre parcels left in New Jersey now."
There may be good reason for this, Hughes adds.
New Jersey's density is currently 1,165 people per square mile -- denser than both India (at 914) and Japan (835).
No other state even comes close.
The conventional thinking in planning circles is that New Jersey will be the first state in the U.S. to stop large- and medium-scale development outright.
"It may be that New Jersey could be the first fully built-out state in the country in the next 10 or 15 years, under this pattern of growth," says Robert Lang of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech.
The Los Angeles metro area is not far behind.
Again, the distinction between these areas and Minneapolis or Phoenix -- "places that still have a lot of room to run," according to Lang -- is not that every field of wildflowers will be paved into parking lots or built into bungalows for empty nesters.
It's that they'll effectively be off-limits to developers.
Then, if demand stays steady, that meager land supply will, presumably, steadily drive housing prices up.
First, they would face an acrimonious dispute before getting any development plan approved.
And second, that they would make an extraordinary amount of money once they did.

One idea that shapes the outlook of real-estate economists is the notion that cities, in a rough conceptual sense, are replacements for one another.
A city is founded, and residents and industries settle there; over time, that city and its metro area might reach a population of a million residents.
As demand to live there increases and the supply of good land diminishes, housing gets more expensive.
But lo, another city arises nearby, where land is cheaper and jobs are plentiful.
Residents can now leave the first big city, if they choose, and move to the second, smaller city.
Until, that is, the second city becomes large and crowded and expensive as well.
Then another city grows nearby, and so on.
As pressure on prices and land builds, a new city can act as a pressure release.

It's possible that this model has broken down over the past few years.
A small cadre of economists, in fact, has begun to ask whether the irrepressible inflation of home values in many coastal metro areas actually reflects a deeper logic based on the straitened land supply in these cities.
Boom-time rationalists always run the risk of earning a black mark of infamy like that worn by the Yale professor Irving Fisher.
And it is virtually impossible to find an economist -- or a home builder, for that matter -- who thinks the recent growth rates in home prices are sustainable; even the most sanguine among them predict more moderate appreciation over the long run.
Yet almost without exception these thinkers, though they come from different political persuasions and even different research specialties, have attributed high home prices to zoning.
Further, they have amassed a fair amount of data to support their arguments.
Bob Toll's opinions about how the American market resembles the European market derive in part from the work of Susan Wachter, a housing economist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where Toll occasionally drops in to talk to students about real estate.
To Wachter, an assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Clinton administration, "the fundamentals of supply and demand have shifted in the U.S." Wachter says she believes the widespread adoption of controls on growth and building -- beginning in the mid-1990's, just about the time that Toll began to expand nationally -- have pushed up prices in so many regions that it is increasingly difficult for one desirable city to relieve the pressure in another.
I asked Wachter whether she would, like Toll, equate home prices in popular American cities with prices in Europe.
"We're different than Europe," Wachter told me, "but there will be convergence."
In her opinion, the U.S. housing market is somewhere between where we used to be before 1995 and "where Europe is right now" -- where, that is, a smaller supply of land and a stricter regulatory environment make building significantly more expensive.
(European towns also have less incentive to encourage development, Wachter says, because they generally do not, unlike their American equivalents, depend on their local tax base to pay for education and services, which tend to be federalized.)
"The fact of the matter is that housing prices are increasing in the U.S., faster than inflation, in ways we haven't seen before," Wachter says.
"Ten years running.
It's the first time in keeping these numbers that we've ever had a run like that."

Wachter isn't alone in connecting building regulations and prices.
Recently, Joe Gyourko, at the Wharton School, and Edward Glaeser, at Harvard University, used sample prices from 25 areas to show that the cost of housing in a metropolitan area appears to be in direct correlation to its degree of zoning ordinances.
And in a coming paper, Chris Mayer of Columbia, writing with Gyourko and Todd Sinai at Wharton, calls attention to the pricing patterns in what they call "superstar cities."
In metro areas like New York and San Francisco, dynamic and attractive places with limited supplies of land, prices can conceivably go up at above-average rates for a very long time -- "basically forever," Mayer says.
"When San Francisco gets so expensive that a rich person says: 'You know what?
I don't want to pay that much, I'll go look at Chicago instead' -- that's what has to stop it ultimately.
But there's nothing in our model that says that ever has to happen.
Every time we think that housing is ridiculously expensive in the U.S., we should go look at Europe and Asia.
Even after 15 years of declines in Tokyo, it's still more expensive than living in Manhattan.
There's no natural law that says U.S. housing prices have to stop here.
None."

Mayer wonders whether steep appreciation rates will ultimately force some places to reconfigure their zoning in a way that denser development (or more development) increases the housing supply and relieves the pressure on prices.
I asked Toll about this: What happens when New Jersey reaches build-out?
"We've been trying to build it out, but we can't get our hands on it," he said.
"We could sell every square foot that we could build on.
I mean, anything within 15 minutes of Interstate 78 could be built and sold.
Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton, all the way into New York City.
And it's all sitting there."
Toll didn't seem to think the situation would change.
And the fact that so much is out of reach makes everything within reach all the more precious.
Such high stakes explain his company's aggressiveness as well as its resolve.
Toll has estimated that 90 percent of the company's projects in New Jersey involve some sort of legal entanglement.
By invoking something called the Mount Laurel law, named for a township in New Jersey, a builder like Toll can push development forward if its plan includes affordable housing in a township where such a need exists.
A judge who recognizes a Mount Laurel claim can impose a settlement, allowing the builder to construct its homes as long as it puts up a smaller number of affordable units.

Of those, 535 would be stand-alone luxury homes and luxury town houses; the other 630 units would be one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, 175 of which would rent for below-market rates and therefore be designated as affordable housing.

In the 1970's and early 1980's, Toll Brothers was known as a custom builder: the company constructed a modest number of houses to the exacting specifications of its wealthy customers, going out of its way to install any type of wainscoting or kitchen appliance a buyer wanted.
It still offered a lot of expensive extras, but only those that fit into a highly profitable system of luxury mass production.
Rassman and the rest of the company had already learned that buyers will choose visible flourishes over pragmatism every time.
"No one bought it," Barzilay, Toll's president, says.
Wall Street has reluctantly come around to the belief that the big home builders, after years of record earnings, are more financially durable than traditional contractors, whose businesses have lived and died by the boom-bust cycle.
Several stock analysts told me that they've become convinced that Toll and its competitors have the resources to survive (perhaps even prosper) during an economic rough patch like the one that may have begun this fall; the analysts have likewise taken note that big builders put up homes only after signing a contract and getting a deposit.
(Until recently, most builders built on spec, thus increasing the risk of getting stuck with large stocks of unsold houses in the event of a crash.)
Above all, the investment community seems enamored with how executives like Bob Toll have refined production methods over the past decade to push down costs.
Toll Brothers uses prebuilt wall panels and roof-truss systems, for instance, shipped from its factories to home sites; Pulte Homes, a competitor, has gone so far as to introduce prefabricated concrete panels (in lieu of site-poured concrete foundations).
Such techniques aren't entirely new to house construction.
Toll said he doesn't think home construction is much different from 60 years ago, when his father was building houses in suburban Philadelphia.
What's more revolutionary is how Toll, Pulte and the others don't really build anything, at least in a technical sense.
All the physical work in a place like Princeton Junction, for example, is contracted or subcontracted to dozens of electrical, framing, roofing, painting, masonry and plumbing companies, many of which follow Toll in itinerant fashion from development to development for years on end.
These contractors, not Toll employees, do the actual building, in accordance with Toll's signature designs and management strictures.
They answer to a team of Toll executives at every site who are trained to see a community's physical manifestation as part of the larger process of packaging and selling the American dream.
"We're really a marketing company that happens to build houses," Doug Yearley told me.

Once efforts to secure a piece of ground are complete, the firm wastes little time in applying the full force of its marketing and design expertise.
The density of a Toll community is largely defined by local zoning, which determines the size of housing lots and, to some extent, the layout.
So Toll generally works backward from a site: calculating that X number of houses of a certain frontage width can fit within a new piece of ground, then plugging those results into a street pattern that respects geology and geography.
Toll Brothers has created more than 800 residential communities over the years, so engineers often model a prospective community on one that has already proved profitable.
(Toll often uses geographical attributes -- Ridge Road, Lake Drive -- as the inspiration for names, although on occasion, contests at the company headquarters end up letting employees name a street in a new development.)

Next come the products, also called houses.
The size and style of what to build -- stately Colonials, for example, or Mediterranean-style ranches -- depend on regional tastes as well as on marketplace data of how much comparable homes in the vicinity, built either by the competition or by Toll itself, have sold for.
The company has 971 different floor plans in its repertory, everything from urban-style town houses to steroidal center-hall Colonials, all with a wide array of bump-out and bump-up options.
But as Jed Gibson, a vice president who runs Toll's architecture division, explained to me one day, "Our business model is: what's selling out there, and how can we do it better?"
Often, that means that his team must respond quickly when an executive like Yearley says that a new house style from a competitor is selling briskly and that Toll needs a competing product with similar features as soon as possible.
Sometimes, one or two of Gibson's architects visit a house they're trying to emulate.
"We have something at Toll Brothers I call our special sauce," Gibson said, describing the "lines of sight" and "spacious feel" inside its homes.
"So we take the deficiencies of the competition's homes and improve upon them."
"By 1997 and 1998, we started offering homes with 9-foot first and second floors.
And in January 2002, we started offering 10- foot first floors."
In Gibson's view, such modifications are tweaks on the real yeoman's work, which is providing every customer with the essential 4 bedrooms and 2* bathrooms.
Still, the alacrity with which his department can design a new house (one week) and introduce it to potential buyers (a few months) is one reason the American home, at least aesthetically, seems to be undergoing rapid evolutionary change.
Gibson's office can also move quickly to create new exteriors as well as interiors when tastes change.
Take the Toll product known as the Columbia, which happens to be among Gibson's and Bob Toll's favorites.
(Neither Toll nor Gibson owns one, though.
Toll lives in an 18th-century farmhouse; Gibson in a 1915 craftsman-style bungalow he's restoring.)
"It has 22 exterior looks that we can put on it," he explained, which means the Cornell/Columbia can hide behind a French provincial in Pennsylvania and a redbrick Colonial face in New England.
It can, Gibson said, go anywhere or be anything.
Since then, the company has periodically put new groups of houses on the market and has sold about 10 to 15 per month.
Thanks to the company's automatic price increases -- the price of a development's homes might rise by $5,000, say, for every five sold -- the more Toll sells, the more Toll's profits expand.

You can see how it adds up in the end: the stealthy land acquisition, the aggressive legal positioning, the meandering street designs, the furiously gabled architecture, the fungible options and home facades, the demographic targets -- an entire vertically integrated, highly methodological luxury system.
Not long ago, Fortune magazine estimated that the company would make around $100 million on the Estates at Princeton Junction.
The company now maintains that the actual number will be higher.
Consider a single house, and you can see why.
In the part of the development characterized by Heritage Collection houses, the actual cost of building a single 2,700-square-foot home -- infrastructure, land, labor and materials, mostly -- has changed little over the past two years: it's probably in the vicinity of $300,000.
It now costs $695,000, extras not included.
Today, the mayor of West Windsor is a former New Jersey state environmental administrator named Shing-Fu Hsueh.
He sees the tensions in his town as emblematic of the larger battles being fought around the country between developers and preservation champions.
Genial, hard-working and immodest in the way of a small-town politician -- "Did I tell you I got over 87 percent of the vote last year?"
Toll Brothers and West Windsor seem to have settled into a peaceful coexistence in the two years since the company began building the Estates at Princeton Junction, a truce that has been helped in part by Hsueh's willingness to address land-use issues a little less confrontationally.
"I don't think you can stop development," he told me.
"If you try to stop something, the courts will make decisions for you, and it will be even worse."
His town, now with a population of around 25,000, has more than 65 cul-de-sacs, which he regards as a problem accentuated by the Toll layout.
The Estates at Princeton Junction, he said, pointing to the area where the new streets hadn't yet been drawn in, will be a big lonely island of suburbia, bound by train tracks on one side and farm fields and woods on the others, a place connected to nothing else in town, leaving its residents largely in thrall to their automobiles.
Hsueh sees this as the next major issue the town should take up.
He told me he has a vision of the land becoming a "transit village" that mixes residences with shops and offices in a bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly area -- a last-chance attempt to create a nucleus for a town that has been sprawling for the past 30 years and now has no center.
In his view, the blank space also presents an opportunity to look ahead 10 or 20 years.
Hsueh thinks West Windsor will desperately need affordable apartments in the face of prohibitively expensive housing.
"Then our children can move back here," he said.

The big builders I spoke with aren't as averse to the prospect of creating traditional, mixed-use neighborhoods as you might expect.
At the Toll Brothers offices one recent morning, I sat down with Zvi Barzilay, Toll's president and a former Philadelphia city planner who holds a master's degree in urban planning from Harvard.
He is well versed in every kind of design idea.
Barzilay, like Bob Toll, seems irritated by the charge that home builders are somehow responsible for sprawl or cookie-cutter developments.
In his view, Toll Brothers merely responds to market demand while adhering to zoning ordinances that exclude commercial stores from residential projects and mandate big lots and wide streets.
And the company is enormously proud of an attractive, high-density condo complex it just built in a San Francisco suburb.
"There are some buyers who love to live in this kind of environment, because of the dream of socialization and the next-door neighbor," Barzilay said.
"But I think it is only suited for a certain type of buyer and not for others."
Most people, he added, would say, "Give me my one acre, and I want to have my privacy."
And most counties or towns, Barzilay remarked, seem to show little inclination to alter their zoning rules -- the way that Mayor Hsueh intends -- to achieve high-density, mixed-use developments.

You have to wonder what could change this state of affairs.
When New Jersey is closed to new business?
When the Los Angeles metro area hits the San Gabriel Mountains and developers no longer have any big parcels left?
Robert Lang of Virginia Tech recently took a look at other thriving towns he calls "boomburbs" -- places like Scottsdale, Ariz., and North Las Vegas -- and predicted that more than half will be built out under the current pattern of land consumption by 2020.
Such eventualities don't automatically mean a dismal future.
On the contrary, a city bound for build-out might force developers to make better use of its remaining acreage.
Or it could encourage developers to use open lots, transform defunct shopping malls, convert old industrial space -- typically the case in New York, where Toll happens to be in the process of acquiring several such places -- and fill them with housing.
Lang predicts some cities (Arlington, Va., for instance, and Lakewood, Colo.) will improve after build-out.
"It all depends on how you manage the pattern of growth," he says.
Still, there remains the darker possibility that the current building boom will do many things -- or has already -- that can't ever be undone.
Robert Yaro, president of the New York-based Regional Plan Association, notes that it is enormously difficult to get in front of a boom market and plan intelligently.
Development moves too fast; the patchwork of municipalities can't coordinate.
Yaro told me he predicts that there will be 18 million more residents in the Northeast by midcentury; the national population will grow by 140 million.
"If we accommodate the next 140 million Americans the way we accommodated the last 20 or 30 million," he says, "we would urbanize three times as much land as we have over the past 200 years.
We can't afford to do that."

In many regions of the country, Yaro points out, there exist large-scale plans to shepherd the growth of the megalopolises and the megatraffic that all these new Americans will create.
For all his optimism, Bob Toll, for one, has his doubts.
He doesn't seem to think that forceful regional plans can be implemented in the current culture of Nimby politics, where townships, especially in the Northeast, have far more authority over development than counties or states.
"That is the answer," Toll says, "but it can't be done, unfortunately.
In order for you to take power for zoning and planning and put it in a regional council, you would have to take the power from the township.
It'd be the last move you ever made in politics."
The larger and more powerful the regional council, Toll says, the better it would be.
"You would get something that makes a lot more sense" than the development we're getting today.
The $4 million house in an older suburb, in other words.
Or the newer (and cheaper) one-acre house in the most remote exurbs.
"At the end of the world, these prices."

Toll frowned.
If they went ahead with the purchase, you could imagine fairly easily what would take shape a few years from now: an expertly landscaped Toll Brothers development with a thousand well-built, gleaming new homes suitably styled to satisfy regional tastes.
There would be meandering streets and cul-de-sacs.
The community would be far from the city -- indeed, far from anything.

Then again, the land deal was here on Toll's desk, right now, and it might not be available next year.
If Toll didn't build it, someone else probably would.
"Let's study it a little more," Toll finally said, staring at the map for a long while.
"It does have possibilities, and this market is so hot.
But I need to know a little more."
"What do we got next?"
Correction: November 6, 2005, Sunday An article on Oct. 16 about Toll Brothers, a housing-development company, referred imprecisely to West Windsor, N.J., a town near Princeton where it has built hundreds of homes.
As well-meaning legislation goes, it would be hard to beat the law recently approved by the New York City Council over the veto of Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
It requires certain large grocers to provide health care benefits for their employees.
The law -- like a handful of similar efforts from Long Island to San Francisco -- is a response to the growing strain on Medicaid and other government assistance programs from uninsured workers.
A major inspiration for the legislation is clearly Wal-Mart.
The list goes on.
Fed up, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are in various stages of trying to force the big employer to take care of its own.
While it's easy to sympathize with the frustration of local governments left holding the bag, this kind of piecemeal legislation is no answer.
For one thing, it's very possibly illegal -- federal law generally protects employers from this kind of local mandate.
And while it's emotionally satisfying to take a whack at the big-box stores, it hardly addresses the real problem.
In New York, caring for the city's working uninsured costs more than $600 million annually, according to a Columbia University report.
Wal-Mart can't be blamed for any of that, as it has been unsuccessful in pursuing a site in the city.
The nation's health care problems are too complicated to be addressed by a chock-a-block system of overzealous, homespun laws that fail to address the overarching problem of the uninsured and may not hold up in court, anyway.
The problem cries out for a federal solution.
Without some kind of aid, many small businesses would crumble under the cost of health care benefits -- which the New York City law estimates at $5,000 per employee per year.
For right now, there is a commendable effort in Congress to post on the Internet the names of employers with large numbers of workers on public aid, the idea being that shame can be an effective weapon.
The same kind of shame, however, should also be aimed at Washington lawmakers who have done nothing to solve the larger problem, the crying need for national health insurance.

That income was somewhat offset by several unexpected charges.
In North America, Citigroup's consumer business was notably weak, with increases in interest rates squeezing profit margins by raising the bank's cost of funds.
"Anybody who tells you that a flat yield curve is fine or that rising interest rates are good for the banking industry isn't in the same banking industry," Sallie Krawcheck, Citigroup's chief financial officer, said in an interview.
"Clearly these things are not helpful, but there are ways to manage through it."
Unlike producer prices, consumer prices include taxes, subsidies and distribution costs.
"That suggests that we are getting some inflationary pressures building in the pipeline," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a research firm.
"Those are the numbers that are likely to show up" in consumer prices.
Thus far, businesses have not passed along the entire increase in their costs to consumers.
Economists have struggled to explain fully why that may be happening and how much longer it can continue.

Underlying the visit of so many high-level American officials is a realization that the American trade deficit is widening, and that, to some degree, purchases of American homes and sport utility vehicles are being partly financed by China, which is using its huge foreign exchange reserves to buy United States Treasury securities, thereby holding down interest rates.

Well before Bush 43 took office, they had become fixated on Iraq, though for reasons having much to do with their ideas about realigning the states in the Middle East and little or nothing to do with the stateless terrorism of Al Qaeda.

But here, too, was an impediment: there had to be that "why" for the invasion, the very why that today can seem so elusive that Mr. Packer calls Iraq "the 'Rashomon' of wars."

For Mr. Rove and Mr. Bush to get what they wanted most, slam-dunk midterm election victories, and for Mr. Libby and Mr. Cheney to get what they wanted most, a war in Iraq for reasons predating 9/11, their real whys for going to war had to be replaced by fictional, more salable ones.
We wouldn't be invading Iraq to further Rovian domestic politics or neocon ideology; we'd be doing so instead because there was a direct connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda and because Saddam was on the verge of attacking America with nuclear weapons.
As we know from many journalistic accounts, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Libby built their "case" by often making an end run around the C.I.A., State Department intelligence and the Defense Intelligence Agency.
THIS is what Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell's wartime chief of staff, was talking about last week when he publicly chastised the "Cheney-Rumsfeld cabal" for sowing potential disaster in Iraq, North Korea and Iran.
It's this cabal that in 2002 pushed for much of the bogus W.M.D.
One of WHIG's goals, successfully realized, was to turn up the heat on Congress so it would rush to pass a resolution authorizing war in the politically advantageous month just before the midterm election.

There's no serious disagreement that two major crises of our time are terrorism and global warming.
And there's no disputing that America's oil consumption fosters both.
Oil profits that flow to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries finance both terrorist acts and the spread of dangerously fanatical forms of Islam.
The burning of fossil fuels creates greenhouse emissions that provoke climate change.
All the while, oil dependency increases the likelihood of further military entanglements, and threatens the economy with inflation, high interest rates and risky foreign indebtedness.
Until now, the government has failed to connect our crises and our consumption in a coherent way.
That dereliction of duty has led to policies that are counterproductive, such as tax incentives to buy gas guzzlers and an overemphasis on increasing domestic oil supply, although even all-out drilling would not be enough to slake our oil thirst and would require a reversal of longstanding environmental protections.
Now, however, the energy risks so apparent in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina have created both the urgency and the political opportunity for the nation's leaders to respond appropriately.
The government must capitalize on the end of the era of perpetually cheap gas, and it must do so in a way that makes America less vulnerable to all manner of threats -- terrorist, environmental and economic.
The best solution is to increase the federal gasoline tax, in order to keep the price of gas near its post-Katrina highs of $3-plus a gallon.
That would put a dent in gas-guzzling behavior, as has already been seen in the dramatic drop in the sale of sport-utility vehicles.
And it would help cure oil dependency in the long run, as automakers and other manufacturers responded to consumer demand for fuel-efficient products.
Still, raising the gas tax would be politically difficult -- and for very good reasons.
The gas tax, which has been at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, is painfully regressive.
It hits hardest at poor people for whom fuel costs consume a proportionally larger share of their budgets; rural dwellers for whom truck-driving over long distances is an everyday activity; and the gasoline-dependent middle class, particularly suburban commuters, who, on top of living far from their workplaces, have been encouraged by decades of cheap gas to own large, poor-mileage vehicles.

II...................THE MORAL HAZARD OF INSURANCE
The amount of underfunding in corporate pension plans totals a staggering $450 billion.
Part of that liability is attributable to otherwise healthy corporations that will most likely, in time, make good on their obligations.
But the plans of the companies that fail will become the responsibility of the government's pension insurer, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
The P.B.G.C., which collects premiums from corporations and, in theory, is supposed to be self-financing, is deeply in the hole, prompting comparisons to the savings-and-loan fiasco of the 1980's.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In such situations, individuals are tempted to take more risk than is healthy for the group; economists, in a glum appraisal of human nature, call it "moral hazard."
In effect, America's pension system has been a laboratory demonstration of moral hazard in which the insurance may end up bankrupting the system it was intended to save.
Given that pension promises do not come due for years, it is hardly surprising that corporate executives and state legislators have found it easier to pay off unions with benefits tomorrow rather than with wages today.
The P.B.G.C.
is now $23 billion in the red -- a deficit that is expected to grow, significantly, as more companies go under.
The balance sheet for the end of September will very likely show a deficit of more than $30 billion.
If nothing is done to fix the system, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts, the deficit will mushroom to more than $100 billion within two decades.
This liability will almost certainly fall back on the taxpayers, since the alternative to a bailout -- letting the pension agency fail -- would force aging former auto workers and other retirees onto the street.
As bad as that sounds, the problem of state and local government pensions is even worse.
Public pensions, which are paid by taxpayers and thus enjoy an implicit form of insurance, are underfunded by a total of at least $300 billion and arguably much more.
While governments have been winking at these deficits for years, they are now becoming intolerable burdens for taxpayers.
In San Diego, pension abuse has effectively bankrupted the city.

Not only are taxpayers certain to suffer, but senior citizens in the future may also have to settle for less secure retirements anchored only by Social Security and whatever they've managed to put away into their 401(k) accounts.
A backlash already has begun in state capitals, where the political forces that have been lobbying for Social Security reform have been rallying lawmakers to get out of the pension business altogether.
This mimics a trend in the private sector, in which corporations have been leaving the system, either by paying off their workers and terminating their pension plans or by "freezing" their plans, a step recently taken by Hewlett Packard, so that many current employees will no longer accrue benefits and new employees will not participate at all.

If the pension system continues to wither, it is not hard to envision a darker future in which -- as was true until early in the 20th Century, before the advent of pensions -- many of the elderly would be forced to keep working to stave off poverty.
III....................THE SHRINKING PENSION SYSTEM
Congress has been debating legislation to fix the private system, but it has been unable to resolve a basic tension: anything it does to ease the burden on failing or failed pension plans lessens the penalty for failure and enhances moral hazard.
By making it easier for, say, a Delta or a Delphi to offer benefits, it raises the possible cost of a future bailout.
The tough medicine favored by the Bush administration, which would eliminate loopholes in the system as well as much of the subsidy that now exists in the insurance system, would lead to more companies freezing their plans or leaving the system outright.
The number of pension plans would continue to shrink and in time all but disappear.
This would strip the elderly of the future of what is still the most secure form of retirement income.

The fear of runaway pension costs plainly echoes the Social Security debate, and many suspect that the Bush administration would not much mind if pensions did disappear.

This may have made economic sense, but federal law has long recognized a social purpose to pensions as well.

This remains a legitimate function, and if pensions were allowed to die, we would need something to take their place.

IV...............................WHY PENSIONS MATTER
To understand why pensions are still important, you have to understand the awkward beast that benefits professionals refer to as the U.S. retirement system.
It is not really one "system" but three, which complement each other in the crudest of fashions.
The lowest tier is Social Security, which provides most Americans with a bare-bones living (the average payment is about $12,000 a year).
The highest tier, available to the rich, is private savings.
In between, for people who do not have a hedge-fund account and yet want to retire on more than mere subsistence, there are pensions and 401(k)'s.
Currently, more than half of all families have at least one member who has qualified for a pension at some point in his or her career and thus will be eligible for a benefit.
And among current retirees, pensions are the second-biggest source of income, trailing only Social Security.
It is possible that they helped to cause the upswing.
From the beneficiary's standpoint, pensions mean unique security.
The worker gets a guaranteed income, determined by the number of years of service and by his or her salary at retirement.
And pensions don't run dry; workers (or their spouses) get them as long as they live.
Because the employer is committed to paying a certain level of benefits, pensions are known as "defined benefit" plans.
Since an individual's benefit rises with each year of service, the employer is supposed to sock money away, into a fund that it manages for all of its beneficiaries, every year.
The point is that workers don't (or shouldn't) have to worry about how the benefit will get there; that's the employer's responsibility.
Of course, the open-ended nature of the guarantee -- the very feature that makes pensions so attractive to the individual -- is precisely what has caused employers to rue the day they said yes.
No profit-making enterprise can truly gauge its ability to meet such promises decades later.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
A 401(k), on the other hand, promises nothing.
It's merely a license to defer taxes -- an individual savings plan.
The employer might contribute some money, which is why 401(k)'s are known as "defined contribution" plans.
Or it might not.
Even if the company does contribute, it offers no assurance that the money will be enough to retire on, nor does it get involved with managing the account; that's up to the worker.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Post-bubble, the picture looks different.
Various people have studied how investors perform in their 401(k)'s.
According to Alicia Munnell, a pension expert at Boston College and previously a White House economist, pension funds over the long haul earn slightly more than the average 401(k) holder.
Among the latter, those who do worse than average, of course, have no protection.
Moreover, pensions typically annuitize -- that is, they convert a worker's retirement assets into an annual stipend.
They impose a budget, based on actuarial probabilities.
This might seem a trivial service (some pensioners might not even realize that it is a service).
The answer is $654 a month: this is the annuity that $100,000 would purchase in the private market.
It is the amount (after deducting the annuity provider's costs and profit) that the average person could live on so as to exhaust his savings at the very moment that he draws his final breath.
So the question arises: what if he lives longer than average?
This is the beauty of a pension or of any collectivized savings pool.
The pension plan can afford to support people who live to 90, because some of its members will expire at 66.
It subsidizes its more robust members from the resources of those who die young.
This is why a 401(k) is not a true substitute.
Jeffrey Brown, an associate finance professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a staff member of the president's Social Security commission, notes that as baby boomers who have nest eggs in place of pensions begin to retire, they will be faced with a daunting question: "How do I make this last a lifetime?"
This converted pensions into a form of social welfare.
Governments couldn't offer big paychecks for workers -- teachers, the police, firefighters -- so it offered stability and pensions instead.

Since pension liabilities are, for the most part, future liabilities, companies calculate their present obligation by applying a discount rate to what they will owe in the future.
As interest rates move lower, they have to set more money aside because it is assumed that their assets will grow more slowly.
The principle is familiar to any individual saver: you need to save more if you expect, say, a 5 percent return on your investment instead of a 10 percent return.
What is much in dispute is just which rate is proper for pension accounting.
Corporations have been gaming the system by using the highest rates allowable, which shrinks their reported liabilities, and thus their funding requirements.
The P.B.G.C., when calculating the system's deficit, uses what is in effect a market rate; whatever it would cost to buy annuities for everyone covered in a pension plan is, it argues, the plan's true "liability."
The difference between these measures can be extreme.
Depending on whom you talk to, General Motors' mammoth pension fund is either fully funded or, as the P.B.G.C.
maintains, it is $31 billion in the hole.

What is not in dispute is that when interest rates fell, the present value of pension liabilities (by whatever measure) soared.
The confluence of falling stock prices, plunging interest rates and a recession in the beginning of this decade was the pension world's equivalent of the perfect storm.
(To do so, a sponsor generally must prove that it could not re-emerge as a viable enterprise without shedding its pension plan.)

He also argues, rather convincingly, that lax rules allowed pension sponsors to get away with inadequate funding.
Bethlehem Steel similarly enjoyed a three-year funding holiday as it was going through hard times, letting its liabilities swell in advance of turning them over to the government.
Miller disputes the notion that capital-scarce companies like Bethlehem intentionally game the system by shirking funding.
"Companies don't like falling behind," he says.
"When you have a hard choice between starving the capital base to feed the pension plan, or making capital investments to become more productive, to the extent there is permission that's what you do."
The point is, they had permission.
When the P.B.G.C.
For companies that terminate their pension plans, such gross underfunding has become the norm.
Either assets suddenly vanish when the P.B.G.C.
walks in the door, or, evidently, the system for measuring "full" funding is broken.
As Belt testified to the Senate Committee on Finance in June, "United, US Airways, Bethlehem Steel, LTV and National Steel would not have presented claims in excess of $1 billion each -- and with funded ratios of less than 50 percent -- if the rules worked."

Even leaving aside the debate over which rate to use in calculating pension liabilities, there is no doubt that Erisa permits companies to use some doubtful arithmetic.
For instance, the law lets corporations "smooth" changes in their asset values.
If the stocks and bonds in their pension funds take a hit (as happened to just about every fund recently), they don't have to fully report the impact.
Nor do they have to ante up fresh funds to compensate for the loss for five years.
A similar smoothing is permitted on the liability side.
And though, in theory, Erisa discourages underfunding by requiring offenders to pay higher premiums, its various loopholes render the sanction toothless.
Thanks to another loophole, companies that contribute more than the required amount get to skip future contributions even if they later become underfunded.
These companies are awarded so-called "credit balances," which remain in place even if the actual balance is showing red.

Incredibly, when United's plans were terminated, earlier this year, even though they were groaning under $17 billion in pension liabilities and a mere $7 billion in assets, they still had credit "balances" according to Erisa.
(By law, the P.B.G.C.
will be on the hook for most, but not all, of United's shortfall.
The agency guarantees pensions up to $45,000 a year; employees, mostly pilots, who were owed richer pensions are uninsured above the cap.)

Their dubious funding history notwithstanding, corporations -- airlines in particular -- have been lobbying for greater permissiveness for several years.
And they have gotten it.
Congress has twice relaxed the rules, permitting pension sponsors to use a higher rate to calculate their liabilities.
VII..............................WHAT BUSH WOULD DO?
Enter the Bush administration: it has essentially declared the era of permissiveness over.
Among other changes, it wants the funding rules tightened.
To tackle moral hazard, it wants to stop companies with poor credit ratings from granting benefit hikes, or from doling out unfunded pension benefits to unions who agree to plant shutdowns.
It even wants to prevent workers at some companies whose bonds are given a "junk" rating from accruing more years of service.
This would be painful to employees at many industrial companies, possibly including G.M.

Indeed, one reading of the administration proposal is that, having seen the steel and airline industries raid the P.B.G.C., it is drawing the line at the auto industry -- whose initial distress, of course, prompted the agency's founding.
No question our single largest source of exposure is the auto sector."
Since G.M.
's stock was downgraded to junk status earlier this year, the possibility that it would file for bankruptcy has been the subject of on-again, off-again debate on Wall Street.
G.M.
's pension plan totals an astronomical $90 billion; a bankruptcy filing would be the P.B.G.C.
's biggest nightmare.
G.M.
says the notion is far-fetched.
The company seems to have plenty of liquidity and, just two weeks ago, with retiree costs a major concern, it reached an agreement with the U.A.W.
to trim health benefits.
G.M.
and other industrial companies, along with their unions, have harshly attacked the Bush pension proposal, which would force many old-economy-type corporations to put more money into their pension funds just when their basic businesses are hurting.

Alan Reuther, Walter's nephew and the U.A.W.
's legislative director, says the provisions to restrict benefits would be "totally devastating for workers and retirees."
He makes no apologies for "30 and out" -- a fair reward, he maintains, for hard service on the assembly line -- and he wonders at the post-modern notion that blue-collar workers should be responsible for their own retirements because giant corporations can't handle it.
Also, a typical G.M.
pension for someone with 30 years on the job is about $18,000 a year.
That is hardly to be compared with an airline pilot's.
"The P.B.G.C.
is focused on protecting themselves from claims and not on protecting the claims of workers," he says.
"They forget why they were created."
Social safety nets have their price -- in this case, a little moral hazard -- and that is really what the debate is about.
What has emerged from the Beltway skirmishing thus far are bills on either side of Congress that would in some ways tighten funding but give a special break to airlines.
Premiums to the P.B.G.C.
would rise from $19 per plan participant to $30, and variable premiums on distressed companies would be enforced.
The bills would chip away (but not eliminate) gimmicks like "smoothing."

The Senate is still divided, however, on how to treat corporations with junk credit ratings -- the ones most likely to wind up in the P.B.G.C.

Hard-liners like Senator Chuck Grassley insist they should be forced to strengthen their pension plans in a hurry; Senators Mike DeWine and Barbara Mikulski (both from states with blue-collar constituencies) want to give such companies lenience.
So after months of lobbying, politicking and deal making, moral hazard is still alive.

VIII..............................PENSION VS. POTHOLES
The P.B.G.C.
does not protect government pensions, but dynamics similar to those in the private sector have also wrecked the solvency of public plans.
Even in states where budget restraint is gospel, public-service employees have found it relatively easy to get benefit hikes for the simple reason that no one else pays much attention to them.
In the corporate world, stockholders, at least in theory, exert some pressure on managers to show restraint.
But who are the public sector "stockholders"?
The average voter doesn't take notice when the legislature debates the benefits levels of firemen, teachers and the like.
On the other hand, public-employee unions exhibit a very keen interest, and legislators know it.
So benefits keep rising.
As a matter of practice, those benefits are as good as insured.
Because public pension benefits are legally inviolable, default is not an option.
Sooner or later, taxpayers will be required to put up the money (or governments will be forced to borrow the money and tax a later generation to pay the interest).
Thus, unions can bargain for virtually any level of benefits without regard to the state's ability, or its willingness, to fund them.
This creates moral hazard indeed.
At least in the private sphere, there are rules -- ineffectual rules maybe, but rules -- that require companies to fund.
In the public sector, legislatures wary of raising taxes to pay for the benefits that they legislate can simply pass the buck to the future.
This explains how the West Virginia Teachers Retirement System has, embarrassingly, only 22 percent of the assets needed to meet its expected liabilities.
It also explains how Illinois, a low-tax state, is underfunded by some $38 billion, or $3,000 per every man, woman and child in the state.
California is a good example of the political forces that have driven benefits higher.
In the 90's, Gov.
Thus, a cop hired at age 20 could retire at 50, find another job and get a pension equal to 90 percent of his final salary.
Counterintuitively, as benefits were going up, the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), which was boasting high returns in the stock market, allowed state agencies and local governments to reduce their contributions.

Meanwhile, Trenton achieved a sort of transitory budget balance by contributing less to its pension system.
But during the dot-com debacle, its investments plunged.
This year, the last easy-funding year, New Jersey will contribute $220 million to its pension system; by 2010, the annual bill will be an impossible-seeming $2.5 billion.
State pension officials say that if New Jersey were a private corporation, its system would be nearly bankrupt.
"In the real world this is a P.B.G.C.
Raising taxes is politically forbidden (Forrester has been campaigning to cut property-tax rates).

And the state's reported pension underfunding, officially $25 billion, is undoubtedly optimistic.
It assumes that New Jersey's pension assets will earn 8.25 percent, a number collectively determined -- some say pulled from thin air -- by the state's pension council.
Even Orin Kramer, a private hedge-fund manager who also is also chairman of the council, says that any assumption higher than 7.5 percent is unrealistic.
"The published numbers are divorced from economic reality," Kramer says.
"No one even does the math for what will happen if you only do 7 percent because it's too serious.
You start firing cops and teachers."
According to Barclay's Global Investors, if you use realistic assumptions, the total underfunding in all public plans is on the order of $460 billion.
If this figure is even close to true, future taxpayers will be hopelessly in hock to the police, firefighters and teachers of the past.
Cutting pensions (unlike health benefits) is simply not an option.
State constitutions forbid public entities, even prospectively, from reducing the rate at which employees accrue benefits.
They can tinker with, or abolish, benefits for future employees, as Alaska did, but for a worker already on the payroll, benefits -- even benefits that might not be earned for many decades hence -- are sacrosanct.
These benefits are like headless nails; once driven in they can never be removed.
This year, New York's Legislature approved 46 new bills -- more headless nails -- to increase pension benefits, according to E.J.
McMahon, an analyst at the Manhattan Institute.
New York's benefits already rank among the most generous in the country, and the new bills would expand categories of workers who can retire early, or who can qualify for higher rates.
Such bracket creep is pervasive.

one of the biggest pension offenders is San Diego, where six members of the pension board, including the head of the local firefighters' union and two other union officials, have been charged with violating the state's conflict-of-interest code, a felony.
What is interesting about San Diego is that, juicy details aside, its pension mess actually looks rather commonplace.
The six board members are accused of making a deal to let City Hall underfund the pension system in return for agreeing to higher benefits -- including special benefits for themselves.
Explicitly or otherwise, this is what unions and legislators have been doing all over the country.
A senior adviser on pensions to Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger told me he fears that ever higher benefits are inescapable, given the fact that legislators control the benefits of people whose support is vital in elections.
Calpers, the country's biggest state-employee retirement system, responds that the pension system has worked well.
And for Calpers's 1.4 million members, it has.
The average benefit for retirees is $21,000 a year, more than most at General Motors.
But at some point, the interest of the public and the interests of public employees diverge.
Schwarzenegger has vowed to revisit the issue in 2006.
This battle is being fought from statehouse to statehouse.
Michigan (mimicking Alaska) has closed its pension plan to some new employees, and various states, including Florida, Colorado, South Carolina, Arizona, Ohio and Montana, are taking a partial step of letting employees choose between defined contribution plans and traditional pensions.
This compromise does not really change much.
Most employees who are given the choice opt, quite naturally, to keep their pensions.
Partly for that reason, the Citizens Budget Commission, a politically neutral watchdog, concluded that only by ending pensions outright (for new employees) could New York avert a future fiscal calamity.
"Changes in pension benefits for future workers would yield fiscal gains only slowly," the commission noted in a position paper, "but the service to the future fiscal health of the City and State would be enormous."
Most legislatures are not about to do that anytime soon.
There is a legitimate argument for preserving public pensions, however, if only they could be put on a sound fiscal basis.
Critics like Grover Norquist, the tax-cut crusader, lampoons pensions as remnants of a stodgy, Old World economy.
The desire to collect a pension, he argues, keeps workers from moving to better opportunities and shackles employers to workers who are just marking time.

But while mobility is generally considered a virtue in the modern economy, it isn't appropriate everywhere.
It may be desirable for a software engineer to move from job to job, notes Robert Walton, a Calpers assistant executive; "for teachers, firefighters, nurses, engineers, that isn't the type of work force you want."
Stability is a virtue.
The trick is to force legislatures to commit to funding with the same zeal with which they commit to benefits.

De Maio, the San Diego watchdog, is lobbying for a federal law that would impose Erisa-type rules on public plans.
Another solution might be found in the Texas Municipal Retirement System, which represents 800 cities and towns in the state.
It has a blended system of automatic employer and employee contributions that are managed by the system and turned into an annuity upon retirement.
These sorts of remedies could avert plenty of future San Diegos.
In principle they are quite simple.
It is only the politics that are difficult.
IX...........HOW DO YOU MAKE SAVINGS LAST A LIFETIME?
On the private side, benefits professionals have been touting so-called cash-balance plans, a hybrid that in some ways looks like a 401(k), as the best hope for saving the pension industry.
With a traditional pension, employees accrue benefits very slowly during their first 20 years and very rapidly during their next 10 (this is why pension plans act as retention tools; you pay a penalty for leaving early).
Thus, an employee who stays at a company for 30 years gets a much bigger pension than one who works at three companies for 10 years each.
Cash-balance plans were devised to appeal to younger workers, most of whom do not envision retiring at the firm that hired them out of college.
In these plans, employees accrue benefits steadily, one decade to the next.
There is no penalty for leaving, and workers who change jobs simply roll their accrued benefits into their next plan, as with a 401(k).

But the downside of giving more to junior employees is that senior employees get less.
When I.B.M.

lost and the legal status of similar plans remains in doubt.
The pension industry has been lobbying Congress to clarify the status of existing cash-balance plans, but neither the administration nor anyone on Capitol Hill has done so.

To some people, this is further evidence that the Bush administration would just as soon be done with pension plans altogether.
"Defined benefit plans have their advantages," she told me, "but in an increasingly mobile 21st-century work force, the lack of flexibility of D.B.
plans is yielding to greater usage of defined contributions plans."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
It's hard to argue with her, if you look at the numbers.
Although 44 million people are covered by private-sector plans, half are people who have already retired and are collecting benefits or whose plans have been frozen or terminated.
In other words, on-the-job employees accruing benefits -- once the backbone of the system -- constitute only half.
At that rate, even without legislation, the private-sector pension community will mostly die off in a generation.
And pension sponsors are likely to get another jolt soon.
Under current accounting standards, companies can "smooth" their earnings reports, so that each quarter's net income reflects the average assumed performance of the company's pension assets, whether up or down, but not the actual performance.
(Discrepancies from the average are sifted back into the earnings stream over time.)
This means that reported earnings are often wildly misleading.
Robert Herz, chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, has criticized this practice as "a Rube Goldberg device."
If FASB follows up and disallows it, corporate pension sponsors would have to cope with a lot more volatility in their earnings.
Managers hate volatility, and such a change would prompt many of them to fold their plans.

If defined benefits are on their last legs, then it would make sense to try to incorporate their best features into 401(k)'s.
The drawback to 401(k)'s, remember, is that people are imperfect savers.
They don't save enough, they don't invest wisely what they do save and they don't know what to do with their money once they are free to withdraw it.
Quite often, they spend it.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Here there is much the government could do.
For instance, it could require that a portion of 401(k) accounts be set aside in a lifelong annuity, with all the security of a pension.
Behavioral economists like Richard Thaler have demonstrated that you can change people's behavior even without mandatory rules.
For instance, by making a high contribution rate the "default option" for employees, they would tend to deduct (and save) more from their paychecks.
If you make an annuity a prominent choice, more people will convert their accounts into annuities.
Otherwise, it's not hard to predict that as octogenarians and nonagenarians become commonplace in society, many are going to outlive their savings, which is even more scary than outliving the savings of the P.B.G.C.
Promoting an annuity culture is probably the single best way to make up for the demise of pensions.
Yet most companies that provide 401(k)'s don't even give the option of purchasing an annuity when people cash in their accounts.
As Brown, the Illinois professor, notes, "There is no box to check that says 'annuities."'
That is a minor scandal.
"I wish someone in Washington were thinking bigger thoughts about what the optimal retirement package should look like," says Watson Wyatt's Coronado.
What are Secretary Chao's thoughts?
Mark Warshawsky, the Treasury's top economist, has written about the need for annuities, and in an interview he allowed that as 401(k)'s become the primary, or the only, source of retirement income for more people, "I think it is a concern that annuities are not being offered in those plans."
Anything that smacks of regulation (like rules to make sure employees get a particular menu of choices, whether for annuities or for their portfolios) gives the administration shivers.
This is what you would expect, given the administration's strong free-market tendencies.

But the government is already deeply involved, since it shelters retirement savings -- pensions, yes, but also 401(k)'s, which are similarly permitted to grow tax-free.
But in the defined contribution world -- the world of 401(k)'s -- there are no rules.
Employers can contribute or not.
Employees can diversify or blow it all on the company stock (even if it is Enron).
If nothing else, the century-long experiment with pensions has proved that in the absence of the right rules, the money will not always be there.
The purpose of pension reform should be not merely to avoid a fiscal disaster but to find a fiscally sound way to preserve the likelihood of secure retirements.
If people are going to retire on 401(k)'s, those should be subject to rules, and guidance, as well.
It would be nice to think that reform would include a future for pensions, but on the private side at least, it is doubtful.
As Delphi's Miller put it simply: "A pension plan makes no sense in today's world.
It's not wise for a company to make financial promises 40 or 50 years down the road."
Most American executives would agree.
Miller says he has not decided what to do at Delphi.
If workers grant wage concessions, he has said, the pension plan, which is $4.5 billion shy of what it needs, might even survive.
This has the sound of a bargaining ploy.
Knowing that the P.B.G.C.
's guarantee is in place, the unions will probably insist on keeping their wages as close to intact as they can, and Miller will probably end up handing the pension plan over to the agency, just as he did at Bethlehem.
Then, Miller and other executives will get stock and dandy bonuses in a new Delphi that is happily stripped of pension obligations, and some 45,000 employees and retirees will, in time, happily collect their pensions -- courtesy of the U.S. Government.
Moral hazard at work.

Paul Krugman: It’s possible in principle for the Fed to buy long-term bonds, and it might make a difference.
But most people who’ve studied the issue think that it would take huge purchases of U.S. long-term bonds to have much effect on long-term rates.
What the Fed really controls is the monetary base, which has a direct impact on short-term rates.
It’s much harder to move the long-term rate.

Since then, the rally has run out of steam.
Inventory has started to creep up, and predictions for 2006 growth in China are slowing.
Despite the market jitters, not everyone is convinced there is a bubble in copper.
Some investors say that growth in China and India will continue for the long term, changing the fundamentals of supply and demand for metals and fuel.

Pension and fund managers who once dealt primarily in equities or bonds have been moving into commodities as a way to profit from the growth in China.

The French cable manufacturer Nexans, a big copper consumer, has asked the London Metal Exchange to examine why prices for immediate delivery of copper are higher than futures prices (a market condition known as backwardation) even though there appears to be no shortage of short-term supplies.
Backwardation could be a result of stockpiling supplies.
While no one is predicting a repeat of the Sumitomo scandal, such activity may be adding to already high prices, analysts say.
Perhaps the biggest differences are the rise of global production, as well as much easier access to capital, particularly from abroad.
Adding to the change is labor's weaker bargaining power.
These factors have combined to greatly diminish the force of old-style inflation in which demand outran supply, pushing prices ever higher, and wages, too, until the Fed put the brakes on the economy.

Instead, a new style of inflation has emerged as one of the principal threats to the economy.
It is evident in the stock market bubble of the late 1990's and in surging home prices in this decade.
This asset price spiral, as it is called, has proved much more resistant to the Fed's standard interest rate tool than traditional inflation.
Mr. Bernanke, for his part, is known as an advocate of inflation targeting, a technique for adjusting interest rates with the aim of keeping traditional inflationary pressures within a limited range.
He has also asserted, like Mr. Greenspan, that he does not intend to use interest rates prematurely to puncture an asset bubble.
But he has signaled a readiness to use a different set of tools to fight the new inflation, and in this he departs from Mr. Greenspan.
What lifts asset prices, Mr. Bernanke and others argue, is the willingness of lenders to offer riskier types of loans, which "juice up the housing market and are not very responsive to interest rates," as Mark Zandi, chief economist at the research firm Economy.com, put it.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Lenders can engage in riskier loans because they have developed techniques in recent years that make it far easier for them to shed their vulnerability to risk, doing so mainly by shifting the risk of default to others.
The lenders operate in sophisticated markets that allow thousands of individual investors to purchase a slice of the original loan, and a slice of the risk.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In the past, the danger of default as rates rose tended to discourage lenders from making overly risky loans.
Mr. Bernanke, in response to the risk shifting, has raised the possibility of limiting the dangers through the use of regulations -- microregulatory policy, he calls it.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"There are two ways to approach bubbles: one is interest rate policy, the other is microregulatory policy," he said in a little noted interview published last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
"Microregulatory policy is the much better approach, in my view," Mr. Bernanke said.
Pursuing his point, he added: "Research on historical episodes suggests that large asset price increases are sometimes preceded by credit booms.
The surge in oil and gas prices is another big source of inflation that Mr. Greenspan did not have to deal with in his early days as chairman, and through most of his tenure.
Many economists argue that rising interest rates are a double-edged sword under such circumstances.

They note that higher fuel prices do not blunt the demand for petroleum products.
Rather than cut back on purchases of gasoline and heating oil, consumers offset the rising cost by cutting back first on other purchases: automobiles and appliances, for example.
That slows the economy.
Rising interest rates encourage this cutback, slowing the economy even more.

"Whereas in 1987, it was clear that the way to combat inflation was to raise interest rates," said Brian Sack, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers who once wrote a research paper with Mr. Bernanke, "today the Fed's policy makers have to be cognizant that the higher energy prices are slowing the economy" on their own.
Not that Mr. Bernanke would be less diligent than Mr. Greenspan in resorting to interest rates to prevent inflationary expectations from creeping back into consumer and business behavior.
That happens when prices rise unchecked, as they did during the oil shocks of the 1970's, encouraging people to buy more to avoid paying higher prices later.

The stepped-up demand only encourages more price increases, and then wage increases to keep up with the price increases, until the Fed, in response, pushes interest rates so high that the economy is knocked flat on its back and demand finally is punctured.
Mr. Bernanke has no intention of reversing these gains.
"Inflation-averse central bankers," he said in a speech last fall, while he was serving as a Fed governor, before shifting to chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, are "likely to contribute to increased central bank credibility and hence better policy outcomes."

But his world is different from Mr. Volcker's and Mr. Greenspan's.

Economists argued endlessly about how low the unemployment rate could go before inflation began to accelerate, pushed along by rising wages.
The trade-off reflected labor shortages that have since diminished as additional production of goods and services has shifted abroad, in effect globalizing the nation's labor supply.
The unemployment rate has held below 5.5 percent since February, but instead of rising, median wages -- adjusted for inflation -- have fallen.

With interest rates rising, the hot housing market cooling and energy costs coming off a two-decade high, some executives and economists are concerned that consumer spending will slow in coming months.

Still, wage growth has risen less than 3 percent in the last year, while inflation has been running close to 4 percent, effectively cutting many workers' pay.
The spike in inflation, caused largely by oil prices, seems to have soured many Americans on the economy, despite its continued growth.

In October, car dealers, hotels, restaurants and movie and music studios all cut jobs.
Department stores added fewer jobs than they typically do during October; that shows up as a loss in the Labor Department report, because the government adjusts its numbers to account for normal seasonal variations.

Across the economy, in fact, employment rose by 702,000 jobs last month.
John E. Silvia, chief economist of Wachovia Corporation, said many of the sectors cutting jobs depended on consumers, who might eventually react to high gasoline and heating prices by cutting other spending, even if they have yet to do so.

"It's hard to put this all together," said Mr. Cheney of John Hancock.
Economists still expect the Federal Reserve to keep raising its benchmark short-term interest rate in coming months in an effort to tame inflation.

The Fed has increased the benchmark rate, now at 4 percent, during each of its last 12 policy-setting meetings.
It seems poised to do so again at the two remaining meetings before Mr. Greenspan's retirement early next year; Ben S. Bernanke has been nominated as his successor.
Investors are predicting that the Fed will increase the rate at one of the first two meetings after Mr. Greenspan's departure but not at both, based on the price of a futures contract tied to Fed policy.

The widening of income inequality in recent years appeared to continue last month.
Workers at financial, information and professional-services companies -- who tend to be highly paid -- all got big raises.

In his testimony this week, Mr. Greenspan said the country was going through "a very marked changed in the distribution of income."
He added: "We have clearly observed a major increase in the need for skilled workers to basically staff our ever increasingly complex technological capital stock."
It seems like a small difference, but it is no smaller than the change that spawned so many "golden era of offense" articles a year ago.

These changes in the offensive environment can be explained as part random variation, part intelligent design.
Like the Federal Reserve, which shifts interest rates to maintain the balance between growth and inflation, the N.F.L.
rules committee tweaks the rules each off-season to maintain the balance between offense and defense.
"Players have already adjusted to the rules changes from 2004," Jim Schwartz, defensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans, said.
"They've developed alternate techniques that can be effective but less likely to draw an illegal-contact flag."
Indeed, illegal-contact calls are down 17 percent, although the penalty is still called far more often than it was two years ago.
(These numbers include declined and offsetting penalties.)
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Over all, penalties have increased for the second straight season.
There have been 19 percent more flags compared with two years ago, although the league has never announced an initiative encouraging officials to call a stricter game.
And when it comes to this season's drop in offense, the overall rise in penalties is not as interesting as the rise in two specific penalties: holding and pass interference.

Offensive and defensive holding calls are each up 33 percent this season compared with a year ago, but these increases do not cancel each other out.
Offensive holding is more than three times as common as defensive holding, and these penalties are a leading factor in this season's decreased scoring.
In fact, offensive holding has passed the false start as the most commonly called penalty.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Offensive and defensive pass interference are also more common this season.
That simply returns defensive pass interference to the same rate as two years ago, but offensive pass interference was far more rare in seasons past.

The officials, however, are not the only agent of change.
N.F.L.
coaches and coordinators are more likely to try new tactics than their counterparts in other sports.
Game plans change regularly to take advantage of rule changes while also countering the latest popular strategy on the other side of the line of scrimmage.
When a defensive strategy becomes popular, an offensive strategy rises to neutralize it, then another defensive strategy rises to neutralize that, in a never-ending cycle.
Sometimes the new strategies are not even that new.
To counteract the rise of smaller, quicker defensive ends who use speed to rush the passer, some teams have brought back a power running game with that old college standard, the wishbone, which features two halfbacks behind a fullback (or the inverted wishbone, with two fullbacks in front of a halfback).

The euro has declined by nearly 5 percent against the dollar since August, but its slide became more pronounced about a week ago.

Robert Simche, chief currency strategist at Bank of America, said the dollar's surge stemmed primarily from expectations of higher interest rates in the United States, which have been moving up while rates in Europe and elsewhere around the world have stayed relatively low.
"It is hard to find a period in the last 5 or 10 years when expectations about future interest rates been so dominant in the foreign exchange markets," Mr. Simche said.
"It's become the dominant issue."
Higher interest rates attract investors and tend to drive up a nation's currency.
The Fed has been pushing up short-term rates in small steps ever since June 2004, but many investors had been betting that it would pause once rates hit 4 percent or so -- especially when energy prices surged after Hurricane Katrina.
But Fed officials have delivered a raft of speeches over the last month that emphasized their concerns about rising inflation and a determination to avoid a return to the "stagflation" of the 1970's.

Fed officials have also been buoyed by signs of continued strong growth, despite soaring oil and gas prices and the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.

The prospect of higher interest rates appears to be trumping any investor anxiety about the United States' huge trade and financial deficits.
The nation's imbalance in trade and investment with the rest of the world -- known as the current account -- is on track to exceed $700 billion, about 6 percent of the gross domestic product.
That sum, which is financed by funds from abroad, is coming at the same time that American household savings rates have plunged to zero.

Asian central banks have financed much of the United States' borrowing; the central banks of Japan and China now hold more than $1 trillion in dollar-denominated securities between them.
Yet for all the talk about global imbalances, demand for dollars has yet to falter.
"All the talk about U.S. current-account deficits hurting the dollar has vanished from the markets," said Carl Weinberg, global economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting firm in Valhalla, N.Y.
The dollar has climbed 13 percent against the euro this year.
Though interest-rate differences accounted for most of the dollar's recent climb, analysts said the riots in France may have weakened the euro even further.

"The riots are definitely doing something," said Ashraf Laidi, currency analyst at MG Financial Group in New York.
"It's the usual story of growing unemployment in the euro zone, social unrest that is at first attributed to ethnicity but is really about unemployment and the lack of jobs."

But the dollar has gained against other major currencies, recently hitting a two-year high against the Japanese yen and climbing sharply against the Swiss franc.
Analysts disagree about how much of the dollar's rise is part of a longer-term trend.
Mr. Laidi, eyeing the United States' huge trade imbalances, predicted that the euro would climb back from $1.17 to $1.23 by the end of the year.

By contrast, Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, predicted that the euro would continue to fall, plunging to just $1 within two years.
Many analysts and traders contend that the dollar's most recent rise stems largely from a one-time tax break that allows corporations to bring overseas profits back to the United States at a small fraction of normal tax rates.

A stronger dollar reflects to some extent investors' faith in the American economy and helps keep inflation under control.
But powerful movements in either direction also serve as a warning signal of potential economic problems ahead.
Ian Shepherdson, who tracks the American economy for High Frequency Economics, predicted Tuesday that rising interest rates could lead to a crunch in the housing market and a slowdown in overall economic growth by the middle of 2006.
If you enjoy graphic close-ups of fish or bird surgery, "New Breed Vets With Steve Irwin" is the series for you.
Mr. Irwin, best known as the host of "The Crocodile Hunter," lives up to the late-night-comedy parodies of his style, expressing perpetual amazement, predicting excitement that never develops and reacting to just about everything with straight-faced gravity.
"He could still decide to take out his anger on us," the sometimes bug-eyed Mr. Irwin says, as an African elephant awakes from a tranquilizer-dart-induced sleep, during which it has been fitted with a tracking collar.
But the elephant just gets up and walks away.
"It's a tense time for everyone" because every animal reacts differently, Mr. Irwin says as doctors sedate a Bengal tiger that has been having abdominal pain.
But everything goes smoothly.
The premiere episode of "New Breed Vets," tonight on Animal Planet, also visits a sea lion having a spinal tap because of seizures, a 600-pound Queensland grouper (named Bubba) with skin cancer, a great horned owl with a damaged cornea and a snapping turtle that has been kept as a pet and fed the wrong diet.
And there are more.
The cases go by very fast, the medical problems aren't always resolved, and nothing seems particularly "new breed" about the doctors involved.
(Some aren't even veterinarians.)
"One-third of the widening of the deficit is the oil bill, and aircraft sales explains most of the rest," said Carl Weinberg, chief global economist at High Frequency Economics, a research firm.
(Crude oil imports, however, fell by $350 million, reflecting the shutdown of oil import terminals and refineries on the Gulf Coast.)
Food exports fell $296 million, reflecting transportation disruptions caused by the shutdown of the Port of New Orleans.
Prices of all imports dropped 0.3 percent, only the second decline this year, after rising 2.3 percent in September.
Excluding petroleum products, import prices rose 0.8 percent in October.

But other economists say the trade deficit will remain at today's levels, or could deepen, because domestic demand for foreign products remains strong and the dollar has strengthened against the euro and Japanese yen this year, making American exports more expensive in other countries

"Only with very weak U.S. growth or a major drop in the U.S. dollar will the trade deficit improve on a sustained basis," said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers.
"The reason you need these dramatic movements is that the U.S. has, according to almost every study, an incredible appetite for imports."

This week, American and Chinese government officials reached a deal to restrict the growth in textile imports from China for the next three years.
The Bush administration and Congress are also pressing China to allow its currency, the yuan, to appreciate much more against the dollar.
Democratic, and even some Republican, lawmakers have threatened to impose sanctions on the country.
President Bush plans to visit Beijing late next week, and the growing trade deficit with China is expected to be at the top of his agenda.
Economists note that the United States has an increasingly complex relationship with China, in part because it is the largest holder of federal government debt.

"If the Chinese abandon our Treasury market, we would see an enormous jump in interest rates," Mr. Harris said, "and, of course, if we stop buying their products their economy is going to go into recession."
That leaves salt-of-the-earth small investors as munis' only big constituency, and they have more tax-favored savings choices available than ever: 401(k) plans, I.R.A.

Mr. Wyss noted that tax breaks come and go and that investors may be worried that munis will lose their status if Congress overhauls the tax code.
But if a change in the code occurs -- and it is an enormous "if" -- its provisions, which may not even affect municipal bonds, are unlikely to take effect for several years.
Meanwhile, investors can earn an effective return that is far higher than that offered by any other equally safe investment-- if they invest in the right place.
"The main thing you need to consider is what state you live in," Mr. Wyss advised investors shopping for munis.
Interest payments are exempt from state tax only for residents of the state in which a bond is issued, so "if you live in New York, you don't want to buy a New Jersey bond," he said.
You may not want to buy a single bond at all.
A fund may be better.
As with other assets, the diversification of a muni fund provides liquidity -- it is easier to sell shares in a fund at a fair price than an individual bond -- and maximum safety.
Many management companies have single-state portfolios that allow investors to benefit from the double-barreled tax break, too.

The yield premium over Treasuries makes this an especially good time to consider muni funds, in the opinion of Scott Berry, a bond fund analyst at Morningstar.

"If you look at municipal bond funds, they make a better case for themselves than taxable bond funds," he said.
"When you look at tax-equivalent yields, you're getting a much better deal."

THE uniform credit quality of general-obligation munis -- those backed by state treasuries, not revenues from specific projects like toll roads -- makes cost a pivotal factor when choosing a fund, Mr. Berry advised.

"Returns in muni bond land are typically tightly bunched," he said.
"If you've got an expense advantage, it can be a huge hurdle for competitors to overcome."
One firm renowned for the low costs of its equity funds is a top name in municipal bond funds, too.
"Vanguard funds are tough to ignore," he said.
"Their costs are so low, they're tough to beat."
It is hard for a muni fund to beat the market, but they try in one of two ways -- by changing their cash position to bet on interest rates or by choosing issues that are slightly riskier and offer slightly higher yields.
Mr. Berry favors managers that use the latter method.

"At the top of our list would be Fidelity," he said.
"Franklin is another that doesn't mess around with interest rate bets.
We're big fans of the Franklin muni group."
Among the managers he prefers that take the first approach is Salomon Smith Barney, which he called "one of the few that we would recommend that take interest rate bets."
Vanguard does, too, but its managers are content to "make slight adjustments."

Mr. Wyss anticipates an adjustment in the gap between muni and Treasury yields.
"I expect yields to come back together as people get confident that tax laws are not about to change," he said.
"I'm surprised at how long this aberration has continued.
It almost makes me think I should go out and buy more."
When is a show that includes movement, songs, speech, objects and film not a dance, not a piece of theater, not a musical comedy, not a movie and not performance art?
When it's Grand Magasin's "Fifth International Forum of Corporate Cinema," opening at St. Ann's Warehouse on Thursday night, as part of the citywide Act French Festival through Dec. 15.
Two former dancers, François Hiffler and Pascale Murtin -- fed up, as Ms. Murtin put it, "with this constant business of virtuosity, of sweat, of daily training" -- have tried their best to forget everything they know about choreographed movement and create unidentified theatrical objects.
Since then Mr. Hiffler and Ms. Murtin and their collaborators have expressed many other things, according to the following rules: no unfamiliar references; no props that can't be bought at a supermarket; no stories; no movement that couldn't be done by nondancers.
This may all invoke thoughts of the Judson Church group in the 1960's and the choreographer Yvonne Rainer's manifesto, which began: "NO to spectacle no to virtuosity no to transformations and magic and make-believe."
But Grand Magasin have rather less lofty concerns as they present their latest take on the minutiae of daily life.
This time around, they have taken on the conundrums of the modern office.

"It's noncontroversial," said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and a member of the Senate Banking Committee.
"It's hard to argue about his qualifications."
But Mr. Bernanke will nonetheless face questioning on three basic questions:
How would inflation-targeting work, and would it be more rigid and formulaic than policy making under Alan Greenspan?
Based on his writings and his signals to lawmakers in recent days, Mr. Bernanke is likely to emphasize the need for flexibility and "constrained discretion."
Is Mr. Bernanke a hawk or a dove on fighting inflation?
His writings and his record at the Fed suggest he will be in line with the Fed consensus: the top priority will be to maintain price stability, even if it hurts.

"Low marginal tax rates are supportive of economic growth," Mr. Bernanke told the Joint Economic Committee earlier this year.
"I would submit that we would want to look very hard at government spending -- make sure it's controlled -- before we raise taxes, which, in turn, would have negative impacts on the economy."
By almost all accounts, Mr. Bernanke would continue the Federal Reserve's political independence on monetary policy.
His pursuit of inflation targets and other predictable rules for policy making would, if anything, make the Fed less amenable to political influence.

Critics of inflation-targeting fall into two broad groups.
Some, like Mr. Greenspan, contend that the practice would be too rigid and formulaic and would make it harder to deal with unexpected shocks.
Other critics, including some Democrats, worry that inflation-targeting would conflict with the Fed's dual mandate of pursuing both price stability and full employment.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In practice, Fed policy under Mr. Bernanke might not be all that different.
Many analysts contend that the Fed already has an unstated inflation target, about 2 percent a year, and a preferred method of calculating inflation.
Mr. Bernanke, for his part, has written that the Fed can deviate from its inflation target -- perhaps for several years, if necessary -- to cope with an unexpected shock to the economy.

On inflation, many analysts predict that Mr. Bernanke would, at least at the beginning, err on the side of toughness and higher interest rates to establish his credibility with financial markets.

Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds have edged up significantly over the last several months, to almost 4.6 percent from about 4 percent, on expectations that inflation is picking up.

The plan confirmed that the authority has jettisoned an idea it floated in July: using part of the surplus to build a giant platform over its West Side railyards, which it could then sell to developers for office and apartment towers.

The plan made no mention of a proposal last month by Gov.
Mr. Pataki's chief of staff, John P. Cahill, who oversees downtown redevelopment, recently called the authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, to discuss the surplus, but the board has disregarded the proposal -- a rebuff, since Mr. Pataki appointed Mr. Kalikow in 2001 and controls 6 of the 14 votes on the panel.
Mr. Kalikow declined to characterize his talks with the governor's staff, saying, "We have a big commitment to rebuilding downtown."
Of the airport rail link, he said, "We'll be getting to that in due course."

Half of the money will go to the authority, bolstering its five-year capital program for 2005 to 2009.

The plan outlined the use of the $700 million portion of the surplus that is seen as nonrecurring because it stemmed from the unusually high real estate taxes and low interest rates.

The biggest portion, $450 million, will go to reduce an unfunded pension liability, which will save the authority $42 million a year.
And $100 million will finance holiday fare discounts this year and next.
In an acknowledgment of dissatisfaction with breakdowns and delays, the authority is using $50 million of the surplus for service improvements, including better cleaning and more service on two commuter railroads.
It would also include more patrols and bomb-sniffing dogs for the authority's police force.
A proposal to reduce the frequency of off-peak bus service in the city is being put off until 2007.
The authority will also spend $100 million for security improvements, including closed-circuit television cameras in 60 subway stations and buses; locks to secure subway car seats that could be lifted to create a space for a dangerous package; and emergency-exit release devices on floor-to-ceiling turnstiles.
The automated turnstiles --known as high entry-and-exit turnstiles and used at entrances without a station booth -- have been criticized as dangerous because they allow riders to leave only one at a time, unlike exit gates by station booths.
A release device is being tested at the Lawrence Street station, on the M and R lines in Brooklyn, a development first reported by The Daily News.

The budget plan also revealed that the authority has given up, for now, a plan to eliminate 71 conductors' positions on the L subway line.
The plan calls for the organization's staff to vacate 10 of the building's 38 floors in four phases and to move to 10 floors to be leased in a Midtown office building.
Under the arrangement, the secretary general and Secretariat officials would shift space but not be obliged to leave the building during the renovation.

A temporary conference hall would be constructed on the sculpture lawn at the north reach of the United Nations campus at First Avenue and 46th Street.

Under the plan, the Dag Hammarskjold Library buildings on the 42nd Street side of the United Nations complex would be emptied for renovation, with its staff and operations moving to Long Island City, Queens.
The proposal replaces an earlier renewal plan that called for the 3,600 people at the headquarters complex to move for five years to a new $330 million, 35-story building to be built one block south on First Avenue between 41st and 42nd Streets.
The United Nations had to abandon that plan in August after New York State refused to pass legislation enabling it to use the site, which is a playground.
The new plan drops the idea of financing the renovation with a loan from the United States.
Mr. Annan urged the General Assembly to adopt the plan next month so that rising annual costs do not make the project more expensive.
"We're in a new world," said Dallas L. Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute (www.ebri.org).
With the sharp rise in homeownership, credit card use, and employee-directed health and retirement plans, Mr. Salisbury said, "individuals are doing far more than they used to do -- and they have to do far more."

In theory, the greater number of choices and high-technology alternatives should enable consumers to make the best financial decisions for themselves.
In reality, it's time-consuming to track every bleep on one's financial radar -- and harder to see the benefit of doing so.
If you have a couple of children and three or four cellphones in the household, "How do you go through a 10-page bill?"
asks Robert J. Glovsky, director for the financial planning program at Boston University.
"The reality is, you don't."
Losing track of a few dollars here and there might not be so bad, but the price of not paying attention can be much higher.
Credit card companies can raise interest rates for almost any reason, "including no reason," said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
Mr. Mierzwinski added that even a supposedly fixed-rate card could be changed with 15 days' notice.
And rather than bounce a check, he said, many banks "make money on the back end by not bouncing your check -- but charging you a fee."

YOU might not have read the fine print on this one either, but some banks may include the amount of your overdraft with your balance when you go to a cash machine.
So if your actual balance is $100, the machine might say it's $300.

Sometimes it feels like a million cuts, especially when you consider how the pressure to be fiscally vigilant takes a toll on one's sanity.
Apart from the money you stand to gain or lose, "you're always kind of worried whether you made the right choices," said John de Graaf, co-author of "Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic."

"We're confronted with so many options that don't really add to your quality of life, but they do add to your anxiety," Mr. de Graaf said.
"Do I want this product or that product?

You really can go crazy."

So it seems that either you monitor every nickel, dime and surcharge -- and sacrifice your sanity on the altar of fine print and double asterisks -- or you accept the inevitable losses to preserve some free time and peace of mind.
Mr. de Graaf, who is also the national coordinator of the Take Back Your Time movement (www.timeday.org), seems to lean toward the latter.
"Sometimes you just have to make a choice and say, 'I have other things to do, I can't obsess about getting the best deal.
Life is about more than getting the best deal.'
Perhaps by refusing to dither over one cable-Internet-phone package versus another, one might find time to tackle all those other money chores.

Instead, it is just a bar, which is how patrons like it.
Starting early in the afternoon, men trickle in, sit on red vinyl stools and talk.
They drink 75-cent beers from six-ounce glasses.
Each time the wooden saloon door swings open, chances are they will know the face, the name, the family history of the person walking in.
They like a place that won't change, even as the neighborhood and maybe the entire city go to pot.

They like their wisecracks, their dust, their customs.
The only customer at 2 p.m., he has stopped in on many days during the last 20 or 25 years, a tenure that makes him one of the youngsters at the Union Course.
The bartender, Dennis Remson, loud of voice, with long gray sideburns and this day wearing an open-collared denim shirt, severed a row of 10 red tickets from a reel on the wall.
The Turkey Shoot, a Union Course tradition, is not a hunting expedition or a drinking contest involving Wild Turkey.
Instead, people come in just before Thanksgiving each year to throw darts at a wall and try to win a turkey, among other prizes.
But aside from the TV's, an unused jukebox with CD's (from Merle Haggard to Engelbert Humperdinck) and a couple of unused video game machines, the Union Course offers few modern touches, save for electric lights and efficient plumbing.

The walls and ceiling are covered in pressed tin, the only thing, Mr. Remson said, that has kept the Union Course from burning down.
There is one operating tap at the bar, and that dispenses Budweiser.
The tap is fed by a system of ancient coils that must be packed in ice to keep the beer cold, a system dating perhaps to the bar's inception.
But make no mistake, Mr. Remson said: "They're cleaned regularly."

ASIDE from the bar in the front room, and a dimly lit pool table area in the back, that's all there is to the Union Course.

The bar's name comes from the racetrack that once stood across the street, where countless identical aluminum-sided houses now stand.

When the Neirs were operating the place, there were no stools.
"If you're tired, go home," Joe Neir would tell his customers, according to Paul Clement, a Woodhaven native who lives in Suffolk County and who has stopped in regularly since 1953.
In those days, children used to bang on the back door, asking Mr. Neir to fill up their parents' growlers -- metal pots with tops and handles used to transport liquid, typically beer.
But sit around the bar long enough, and chances are the stories and jokes and history and beer will begin to flow freely.

Yet as the roll of old-time joints in Queens that have closed grows ever longer -- the German restaurant Niederstein's in Middle Village, soon to be an Arby's, is the latest casualty -- the people who love the Union Course hang on ever tighter.
Some have elaborate plans.
"If I ever win the lottery, I would buy this place, keep it as a bar and grandfather everybody in to make it a private club," Mr. Clement said, expressing a much-shared wish for preservation.
"I would sell the stuff at cost."

That may not be necessary.
Even without tourist traffic and a place in the greater city's consciousness, the place does all right.

The list of buggy albums had a little something for everyone -- from Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong to Switchfoot, The Dead 60's and Flatt & Scruggs -- but in an unfortunate turn for the dozens of artists who could not have known what copy-protection software their overlords would place on their CD's, customers at Amazon.com had little to say about the music.
"Evil" and "scumware" were among the tags attached to the country duo Johnny and Donnie Van Zant's "Get Right with the Man" -- the first album identified by the blogosphere as containing Sony BMG's doomed D.R.M.
software.
And "rootkit" is now a tag attached to many Sony BMG titles.
"Do not buy" is another.
Among the customer "reviews" posted under the Van Zant album last week was this observation: "Regardless of the legendary family name or anything the group does from here on out, they will forever be remembered for releasing this album."

"It's kind of unfair to us," Johnny Van Zant said of the whole affair, no doubt echoing the thoughts of other Sony BMG artists whose albums are now unfairly (albeit sometimes hilariously) trashed, tagged or wholly ignored in favor of copyright bickering at Amazon.com.

Just as in the United States, soccer in Australia has had to compete with more popular sports -- rugby, cricket and Aussie rules football -- and soccer was more closely identified with, and controlled by, feuding ethnic groups.
The governing body, Soccer Australia, was scrapped and replaced by Football Federation of Australia, with Lowy as the president.
Australia's shift to the Asia confederation in FIFA from the weak Oceania confederation has just been approved and will go into effect next year.
The change will give Australia a chance to qualify directly for the World Cup through one of four berths reserved for Asian teams.
Before winning the playoff last week, Australia had lost two previous playoffs (to Iran, for a spot in the 1998 World Cup, and to Uruguay, for a berth in 2002).

"We can't rely on occasional success, which is why I thought moving to Asia was so important," Lowy said.
Australia has changed a lot in the last few years in our view of Asia and in Asia's view of Australia.
We no longer look at each other as foreigners.
Australia is part and parcel part of Asia.
I like to call it football diplomacy.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 - The Federal Reserve offered its first hint on Tuesday that its long series of interest rate increases could be drawing to an end.
In minutes from the Fed's Nov. 1 meeting, which were released on Tuesday, policy makers said that they would soon have to change the advance guidance about rate increases that they have been providing since the spring of 2004.
In that guidance, the Fed has consistently said that it would seek to raise the overnight federal funds rate at a "measured" pace -- which investors have understood to be a quarter-point increase at each policy meeting.
According to the minutes, which are an edited summary of discussions at the Federal Open Market Committee, policy makers agreed that their statement about the outlook on rates "would have to be changed before long."
But officials also agreed that they could stick to their existing emphasis "for this meeting."
That raised the possibility that policy makers would relax some of their implicit commitments to future rate increases before Alan Greenspan steps down as Fed chairman at the end of January.
President Bush has nominated Ben S. Bernanke to succeed Mr. Greenspan, and the Senate Banking Committee unanimously voted for him last week.
He is expected to win an easy approval by the full Senate in January.
Complicating matters further, inflation appears to be easing.

The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has invoked the specter of rising inflation as the main reason to lift rates from 2 percent -- a level, he notes, that is historically low.
Inflation in Europe is running at roughly 2.3 percent, above the bank's threshold of 2 percent.
Some economists, however, forecast that it will fall back below 2 percent by next summer.
"I don't think these numbers are going to give them second thoughts," said Erik F. Nielsen, the chief European economist at Goldman Sachs.
"But I wouldn't want to be in Trichet's shoes right now."
The bank's plan to raise rates, probably by a quarter-point, when it meets on Dec. 1 is "a done deal," said Lorenzo Codogno, an economist at Bank of America in London.
Still, he added, "these latest numbers suggest the situation is not conducive to a strong rebound in growth."

On Thursday, the French finance minister, Thierry Breton, added his voice to those opposing the pending rate increase.
"I don't see any risk of a revival of inflation, either in France or in the euro zone," Mr. Breton said in the French Senate, according to a text of his testimony.

Germany's new finance minister, Peer Steinbrück, and the prime minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker, have both urged the bank to hold off on a rate increase.
They warn that it could choke Europe's economy just as it is regaining momentum.
Mr. Trichet said this week that the European Central Bank would not necessarily embark on a cycle of rate increases, as the Federal Reserve has done since it began tightening monetary policy in June 2004.
He also disputed suggestions that tighter credit would worsen the economic situation in Germany, France and other countries that suffer from high unemployment.
"We do not see a contradiction between price stability and job creation, and I trust the people of Europe do not see a contradiction," Mr. Trichet said in testimony before the European Parliament.

Economists say business people were rattled by the prospect of higher interest rates, as well as an increase in the value-added tax in Germany under the new coalition government of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The German government, which took office on Tuesday, plans to lift the value-added tax to 19 percent, from 16 percent.
But it has pushed back the increase until January 2007, hoping to stimulate the economy by prodding listless German consumers to spend money next year.

"The underlying trend is still upward," said Jörg Krämer, the chief economist at HVB Group in Munich.
"This just shows that the trees aren't growing up to the heavens."
In any event, economists say, the European Central Bank is driven by more than transitory data.
It believes its current monetary policy is too loose.
What this latest batch of economic statistics will do, economists said, is merely reinforce the bank's innate tendency toward caution.
"But once they start, they may not continue at a rapid rate."
Mr. Bernstein is worried that the current strength of financials has come as the yield curve is flattening.
When the yield gap between 10-year and 2-year Treasury instruments narrows, it limits the ability of banks to profit by borrowing at low short-term rates and lending at high long-term rates, through mortgages, say.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That same defiance of gravity occurred in 1997 and proved short-lived, and Mr. Bernstein has been negative on the sector since the anomaly recurred earlier this year.
In fact the yield curve has been falling far more drastically than it did eight years ago.
"The time to aggressively buy financials, in our opinion, is when the Fed is easing and the yield curve is steepening," Mr. Bernstein wrote.
"Right now it still looks as though the Fed is on a tightening path and the yield curve is still flattening."
John Buckingham, president of Al Frank Asset Management, is far more optimistic.
He is not inclined to pay too much for a stock, and in his opinion much of the industry remains attractively priced.

"There's this perception that financials are so interest rate sensitive that they're going to collapse with the yield curve," he said.
"But we haven't seen the volatility in earnings" that used to occur.
"I think it's wrong to believe these companies are interest rate sensitive," Mr. Buckingham said.
Investors have ignored steady growth in earnings by big banks the last couple of years, he said.
Their stocks have been flat, giving them very low price-earnings multiples.
"Citigroup is the poster child for valuation," Mr. Buckingham remarked.
"It has a P.E.
in the 10 to 11 range.
To me that's extremely attractive."
MR. BERNSTEIN acknowledged in an interview that "the larger commercial banks do have low absolute P.E.
's and higher dividend yields, but I'm not so sure they are quite as attractive on a relative-valuation basis versus the market."

He is not convinced that banks have developed an immunity to rate movements.
"We'll see, I suppose," he said.
"One never knows until after the downturn in the cycle whether any cyclical is indeed less cyclical."
"If you're talking about Goldman Sachs or Bear Stearns or the regional banks that have appreciated substantially on takeover speculation, those stocks are not as cheap as we would like them to be."
That applies still more to asset managers like Franklin Resources and T. Rowe Price.
"We believe those are expensive stocks," he said.
But he considers them exceptions.
Financial service companies "can grow decently over the long term; better than the economy, better than the market," Mr. Buckingham said.
"If you can get a fat dividend yield, too, I think it's an attractive place to put money for the long term."

Kristin Byron, assistant professor of management at the Rochester Institute of Technology, says that some interviewers will directly ask employees why they are leaving.
Q.
How do you prepare for the session?
A.
The more specifics you can provide, the better.
Ms. Byron suggests spending a few hours reflecting before the meeting, so you don't fumble when the pressure is on.
This will help you remember both highs and lows, she said, and will help contextualize situations so you can give accurate impressions of your experience.
"When people aren't prepared, they go in feeling uncomfortable and they say things they might regret," she said.
"Whatever you do, make sure that the information you're giving your exit interviewer is organized and clear so that nobody gets the wrong idea."
Q.
Should you be wary of being too honest?
A.
Honesty is best, but try to avoid too much negativity.
Bernadette Kenny, executive vice president at Lee Hecht Harrison, a human resources consulting firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., said employees should focus on the positive side of their work at the company and speak constructively about opportunities that their new jobs will offer.
"As with many things in business, it's not necessarily what you say, but instead how you say it," Ms. Kenny said.
"The last thing you want to do is go out griping.
Besides, most human resources professionals are trained to read between the lines."

Q.

Certainly, but keeping quiet on particularly sensitive subjects like your manager's communication skills might make it seem that you have something to hide.
As an alternative, said Lawler Kang, president of LK Ventures, a management consulting firm in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., employees should work around uncomfortable inquiries by focusing on something less volatile.
"Redirecting questions that could activate land mines is always a safe bet," said Mr. Kang, author of "Passion at Work: How to Find Work You Love and Live the Time of Your Life" (Prentice Hall, 2005).
"If you have to rate an area as one for improvement, do so vis-à-vis other strong positive traits."
Q.
Is it safe to assume that your interview will remain confidential?
A.
The interview may seem like a private meeting, but it's not.
Most information or opinions you volunteer can be quoted and distributed around the company.
Robin Bond, president at Transition Strategies, an employment law firm in Wayne, Pa., says that in most cases, human resources employees have no legal obligation to keep your comments under wraps.
A notable exception is a discussion of a claim of sexual harassment or discrimination, which must remain confidential until investigated thoroughly.
Even under such circumstances, Ms.
Bond said, the human resources representative is likely to take copious notes.
"When you talk to human resources, everything is on the record," Ms.
"Just because you're leaving the company doesn't mean your words won't live there for years to come."

Readers respond to David Brooks’s Nov. 27 column, “Heroes Abroad, Unknown at Home“:
Jennifer Lambert, Doylestown, Pa.: While I agree with your central proposition that we are doing a poor job honoring our warriors and their valiant efforts in Iraq, I wonder if the reason we are failing at this is because we are not allowed to truly honor the many soldiers who are wounded or killed in action.
It seems that every effort has been made to present a sanitized picture of war to the people, one that denies us the opportunity to weep over flag-draped caskets, to feel somehow connected to this conflict in a meaningful way, rather than just through daily briefings of success.
Perhaps if we were allowed to truly share in the battles, witness the losses firsthand, we might be more inclined to also truly celebrate the victories and those who fight for them.
Lance Helgeson, Chicago: I appreciate your effort to highlight some of the bravery and courage U.S. troops exhibit every day in Iraq.
I also concur with your assessment that we don’t see many examples of heroism in media coverage here in the U.S.
I suspect that the inattention and indifference to real heroes at least in part flows from citizens who, like me, now take a more cynical view on all things we hear about war in Iraq.
I’m reminded of the boy who cried wolf: After a couple of times, nobody hears him anymore or even cares to.
J.T.
Stasiak, Chicago: As a Navy physician stationed with the U.S. Marines near Falluja in 2004, I can attest to the superior fighting ability of the U.S. Marines.
As a group, the Marines are extremely well disciplined, well trained and in exceptional physical condition.
But the Marines just kept coming, continuing to execute brilliantly with unbelievable stamina and vigor.
I honestly do not believe that there was ever a better fighting force in the history of the world.
But wars are won and lost with the mind as much as with strength and physical prowess.
Does it make sense to pay for the same piece of real estate multiple times with blood and treasure?
Are the Iraqi people likely to want to help us if we don’t ensure their safety from reprisal by keeping the insurgents out of their villages and cities once our Marines have skillfully liberated them?
What does having a constitution and being able to vote mean to an Iraqi if his government cannot ensure the safety of capable, honest and courageous people who would run the government much less his own safety?
I agree with celebrating the strength and prowess of our warriors, but it’s hard to celebrate when the fruits of their efforts are constantly being avoidably squandered because we do not have the forces to preserve these efforts.
Under such circumstances, it seems to be more emotionally satisfying to comfort the injured and the families of the dead.
Malcolm MacPherson, Warrenton, Va.: I have asked your question repeatedly, Why don’t we celebrate our warrior heroes?
I have just published a book, “Roberts Ridge,” about arguably the most heroic 17 hours in our war against terrorists, on Takur Ghar in March 2002, with a detailed recounting of what those very brave men did that day, with seven of them dying.
Why don’t Americans care about this recounting and others like it?
I truly believe, after reflection, that the American media, including The New York Times, give scant attention to these kinds of stories, preferring instead to highlight books and stories about failures on the field and the foibles of the military’s leaders — specifically I can think offhand of “Jarhead” and “Assassin’s Gate,” which the critical media have adored.
From traveling around the country on a recent tour for my book, I found that there is enthusiasm and interest in heroes’ stories in the hinterland, once people there know that such stories are available.
Will Crutchfield, New York: The question of which participants in the battle you describe are heroes turns entirely on the questions of whether the Marines had the right to go into that city and whether the fighters inside it had a right to resist them.
It is possible to respect an argument that the Marines did have such a right, but not to respect a column that doesn’t even pause to contemplate the fact that these are profoundly debatable questions, or to count the civilian casualties, or to acknowledge that there are good and honorable people in the world who would feel with equal justification that the heroes were the ones who dared to lie on their backs where they knew the 500-pound bombs would eventually kill them, giving their lives against impossible odds just to chip away at the invaders’ strength.
It is true, as you say, that in modern times the U.S., like all the democracies, has lost some of its readiness to celebrate the strength and prowess of its warriors.
A lot of things have dwindled along with that readiness, and a lot of other things have waxed while it has waned.
It’s likely that the British 80-odd years ago found it less complicated to honor their warriors in Iraq, and also possible that they behaved worse than ours while there, though it’s hard to know without being able to compare directly their versions of Abu Ghraib and all the rest with ours.
But yes, it’s true that we tend nowadays to imagine more easily that good countries, including ours, can do wrong things, and to mute our celebrations accordingly.
We had no trouble celebrating the valor of the firefighters on 9/11, and that should perhaps tell you something.
The position we have now taken is distinct from that: it is that effecting the transition between Saddam and a different Iraqi government whose behavior we do not propose to control in the long run, cannot predict, and have many reasons to worry about was worth, at a minimum, 20 or 30 times the loss of life caused on 9/11 — a loss that even in its far smaller dimension seemed pretty serious to us at the time.
That position is far less deserving of certitude, and celebration has to spring from a certain certitude.
Or should have to.
Mike Marrie, Eldersburg, Md.
: I agree that every American should know a dozen stories like yours.
I have the utmost respect for our troops.
Mr. Brooks, you continue to fight the good fight, but seem to be preaching to en every shrinking choir.
Take a step back, the bus is coming right toward you.
Imagine how conflicted the troops must feel about the dangerous job they do, a real struggle between life and death, all predicated on a lie, a pack of lies.
Mr. Bush could not have been smart enough to start this on his own or even think it could be possible.
I believe Mr. Chaney feed him the line.
Lets get Saddam and grab the oil.
Shouldn’t take long or cost much, a quick little war on the cheap.
Please clear up your conscience on this.
This could be the worst foreign relations disaster in the history of the United States.
Unfortunately we must stay the course for the Iraqi’s, its our humanitarian duty.
God bless our troops, they really need him.
Albert Sanders, New York: You say, “Every time you delve into the situation in Iraq, you come away with the phrase ‘not enough troops’ ringing in your head, and I hope someday we will find out how this travesty came about.”
There are two simple answers.
First, the Republicans you support are against the progressive income tax and believe that it will be helpful if the size of government is reduced.
The result was not providing extra troops for any contingencies.
The second answer is the administration’s generally xenophobic attitude toward world organizations and even alliance with allies.
No doubt this is to please conservatives in the red states who supply Bush his core support.
Douglas Stewart, Danbury, Conn.: Have you ever been there, Mr. Brooks?
Have you ever been in combat?
I have, fourteen months worth in Vietnam, in 1968 and ’69.
Captain Ieva, with all due respect — and I do respect his courage and dedication — is not, with regard to the operation you describe, a hero.
What you described is Captain Ieva doing the job he signed-up for.
I don’t know what the circumstances were that earned him his own Bronze Star, but I hope they weren’t the ones you related.
But the point is that you are wrong, we dont need war heroes to celebrate back here.
Especially in this questionable war, we dont need anything that celebrates anything about it.
Soldiers, marines, airmen, do heroic things repeatedly in a war zone.
Some of their efforts get noted and commemorated with metals, many more don’t, because that’s simply what goes on in a war zone.
This is the Bush-Rumsfeld-Cheney travesty.
Some people don’t want this war to seem like a heroic enterprise because it isn’t.
I know it, my children know it, most of my friends know it.
Thousands of U.S. soldiers and Iraqis dead and wounded and you call it an “enterpirise”?
Michael Palmer, Cornwall, Vt.: Please tell us that you are not serious when you feign ignorance about why not enough soldiers were sent to secure the peace despite the urgent insistence by Secretary Powell and the requests of General Shinseki.
In a word: Hubris.
Thousands upon thousands have died and been gravely wounded so that he could prove that a lean fighting machine was all that we need.
The betrayals of our fighting men and women are numerous.
I suggest you focus on them in future columns.
It is disheartening that journalists here by and large ignore not only the heroic acts of soldiers in Iraq but also the heroic service of thousands of civilians risking life and limb to help build a civil society and political infrastructure as well as to repair electrical plants, schools, hospitals, and sewage treatment facilities in Iraq, at times with considerable success also widely unreported.
John Canning, Burlington, Vt.: When I read your column about Captain Ieva and his men, you raised the question as to why we do not celebrate heroics from this war.
Your present a decent selection of possibilities for why this is so, including the general public being aloof to this war.
Personally, I’ve been following this war very carefully and would like to share my reasons for not celebrating heroic efforts such as those of Captain Ieva’s.
My high school civics classes were all taught by veterans — one from World War II, one from the Korean War, and the last from the Vietnam War.
Both the Korean and Vietnam vets had a terrible time dealing with the traumas associated with their activities during their respective wars.
This message was repeated in college from my professors as well as from visiting professors from the West Point.
Personally, I believe that this war was entered into without much thought.
A lot more could have been done through diplomacy.
I believe that entering into this war was a mistake.
.Had our president done his job, Captain Ieva would never have had to risk his life or deal with the knowledge that his efforts lead to the death of 75 Iraqis I doubt the 75 people who lost their lives were labeled as insurgents prior our invasion.
This is a terrible psychological burden.
Captain Ieva may have it together right now, but if the experiences of my teachers, as well as recent reports in JAMA and other medical and psychiatric journals, are accurate it will come back to haunt him throughout the rest of his life.
Thank you again for your thought-provoking column.
I assure you that I will reread it several times over the next week and discuss it with many of my friends.
I encourage you to think about my point of view as well.
Matt Emmons, Fairbanks, Alaska: The courage of the marines you’ve described is grippingly apparent.
Nicely written.
For someone with such a depth of historical insight, though, I don’t think you’ve asked the right questions in your column this week.
The marine’s quote says it all.
“We assaulted them.”
Sure, give the guy his bronze star, and I’ll gladly applaud when he marches by on Vet’s Day, but inside I’m disappointed that he was there in the first place.
I live in a military town, and my exroomate is over there on a gunship.
She is a mother, and I pray that she will return unharmed.
I’m proud of her as a person, but I regret that she’s been dragged into this conflict.
Individual responsibility for right and wrong actions is the American way.
You don’t honor your kid for doing a first rate job at something that’s ethically wrong.
America will honor the wounds and sacrifices of her warriors, but for a guy that makes it out in one piece, well, it’s sad to say, but it kind of depends on the war.
many Americans — especially those who dominate the culture — are uncomfortable with military valor.
That’s partly because some people don’t want this war to seem like a heroic enterprise.
Captain Ieva, who is now serving at Camp Lejeune and has earned his own Bronze Star, has it right: We’re always painted as victims.
This is a culture that knows how to honor the casualties and the dead, but not the strength and prowess of its warriors.”
You are right, I and many others are very viscerally uncomfortable with glamorizing and romanticizing combat, and I’m afraid I see it more as propagandizing to promote a horror than as a true honoring of people’s sacrifices and risk-taking during war.
Many soldiers are deeply traumatized by killing and maiming, which is the business of war, and no amount of glorification can wipe away their inner wounds.
War may be a sometimes necessary evil and I do not grant that this war was necessary, but I see war itself as a fundamental failure — of reason, of diplomacy, of humanity and civilization.
The fact that we must at times use military force, and use it well, does not license us to call that destruction and killing a form of greatness.
Chris, Baltimore: I think you hit the nail on the head when you said in your column that the average American is too isolated from the war.
It is not that the elite who control the culture are unwilling to glorify war by giving attention to our heroes.
It is that the average American who has not contributed to our country’s defense is embarrassed to admit that these volunteers are doing our fighting for us.
If one avoided military service when there was a draft, or chose not to volunteer in later days, or, today, is strongly inclined to keep ones own children from going to war, then one is not eager to elevate the status of those who make the sacrifices the country is demanding.
People should stop trying to blame things on the elites, or the liberals, or the anti-war interest groups.
It is the average Joe Blow who is ignoring the sacrifice made by our heroes.
Joe Blow was eager to go to war and now is seeing that it wasn’t all a game, or a painless adventure.
Michel Rosenthal, New York: You are correct, we have no heroes in this war.
Why?
I recall collecting newspapers and tin cans and bringng them to school to recycle for the war effort.
With no sacrifice on the home front, and no visible evidence of the horrific ultimate sacrifice made by our brave fighting men and women, how do you expect us to understand the harsh realities of this war, and thus honor heroic deeds such as those of your example, Capt.
Christopher Ieva?
D. R. Koukal, Detroit: Why aren’t there more stories about war heroes like Christopher Ieva?
Because his heroism is tragic, and in the service of a flawed and failing policy initiated by a feckless and callow president.
Bill Clack, East Lansing, Mich.: This Marine hero of yours called in 500-pound bombs on some houses from which he was receiving fire.
Is the Chinese officer who obliterates some homes in your town to kill a few of your neighbors a hero?
Are your neighbors, who happen to not like or understand what the Chinese are trying to do for them insurgents?
I mean, let’s face it, wouldn’t our country be better off if the population could be liberated from its Capitalist oppressors by the enlightened fighting forces of the Chinese Patriots?
Being a warrior is thrilling.
Being a poet meant nothing to him compared to combat.
But warriors kill and maim other human beings, and no matter how necessary the killing and maiming might seem at the time, when you look back, the senselessness of it all brings on a feeling a deep sadness and remorse.
The horror of war acts on the mind as well and twists it in a sadistic way that can drive some warriors to the brink of insanity.
We honor our warriors, because of the heavy price they must pay when their country asks them to do unspeakable acts to defend our liberty.
Aaron Rubinstein, Memphis: I find Mr. Brooks’ claim regarding a cultural elite which is uncomfortable with celebrating military valor to be less than honest.
Totally absent from his writing are references to the construction of the PFC Lynch mythology, the photo-op pulling down of the statue of Sadaam, the obscene tale of Pat Tillman’s heroic death.
Is it because all these stories are about a cynical rewriting of history?
Could it be that as the American people become burnt out over being kept in the dark, being fed manufactured news that even a heartfelt essay about giving honor where it is due simply doesn’t strike the emotional chords deeply?
There’s a price to covering up, lying and making up hero stories in support of a hopelessly botched war.
Part of that price and it isn’t fair is that real heroes are lost in the mind-numbing noise.
Is Mr. Brooks surprised that we find it hard to pay attention?
Lynn Harned, Madison, N.J.: Your accusation that we ordinary people don’t honor military heroes is absurd.
The truth, as you well know, is that the Bush administration discourages us from knowing what’s going on in Iraq.
My guess is that we don’t know about achievements there because we might then pay attention to the soldiers themselves.
That wouldn’t do as many die or are horribly injured.
We’re not allowed to look at that.
We’re also not supposed to pay attention to any atrocities committed in that country, nor are we to know how many innocent Iraqi civilians are killed.
As for your wondering why there haven’t been enough troops .
Ieva and his men.
You ask the question, Why aren’t there more stories about war heroes like Christopher Ieva?
Could the answer to that question be found in the story of Pat Tillman’s death?
The same people who say we have enough soldiers on the ground in Iraq, also use heroic lies to bolster support for the war.
There are so many brave men and women who have died in an unnecessary
war.
A war that we can not leave for fear of greater disaster.
Americans do not want to hear Capt.
Ieva’s story because in our hearts we are ashamed.
Ashamed for the waste of young lives.
Ashamed that we have elected and trusted the weak leaders who have caused those deaths.
Ashamed that America no longer represents the ideals those soldiers hold so dear.
They would blast holes in the walls and charge in — as Ieva joked, like Starsky and Hutch — or they would climb roof to roof, throwing explosive devices into houses before they entered.”
You want us to admire this and call it heroism?
Blasting holes in walls of people’s houses?
Throwing explosive devices into houses?
Are those heroic actions in your mind?
What you describe is repulsive, not heroic.
Heroism is saving one’s comrades or even enemies, not killing bad guys or blowing things up.

Still, in an indication that demand for homes remains relatively strong, the median sales price -- half the homes sold for more and half for less -- rose to $218,000 last month from $213,000 in September and was 16.6 percent higher than a year earlier.
"The evidence is consistent with a slowing housing market but one that is still very strong," said Patrick Newport, an economist at the research firm Global Insight.
But even a moderate slowdown will have a noticeable impact on economic growth, Mr. Newport indicated, because the rise in home values and the boom in mortgages has helped fuel consumer spending.
"There is no way around it," he said.

Mr. Noel said the loss of the grazing allotments would hurt ranching, which would in turn deprive the area's young people of the character-building chance to work on the land.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"Yes, it's a free market to buy and sell," Mr. Noel said recently.
"But if you buy it, you use it."
By retiring the lands, he said, the trust is reneging on an implicit agreement, and "if we allow that to occur, we go down the path of eliminating all grazing on public lands."
If the rancher with the grazing rights wanted to relinquish them to the Interior Department, the trust would pay him to do so.
One deal involved simply paying a rancher to relinquish his grazing rights and find new pastures or reduce his herd.
The trust also started a round of musical chairs, paying three ranchers to yield their allotments, then consolidating cattle on one grazing area while leaving the riverbanks free of livestock.

In tandem with the trust's efforts, the federal land bureau was conducting environmental reviews that tended to find that grazing should end on the acreage at issue.

Bill Hedden, the executive director of the Grand Canyon Trust, said he could not understand why his efforts, involving transactions between a willing buyer and willing sellers, seemed a threat to Mr. Noel.
Ranchers could consolidate their herds in more congenial settings.
Federal officials could bar grazing during a drought without bankrupting ranchers.
The trust, dedicated to preserving the Colorado plateau, could show its financial supporters results.
Besides, he said, the land in question is marginal economically and at risk environmentally.
"We don't know how long this land takes to heal," he said.
But given the resistance of local officials, Mr. Hedden is shelving the strategies he used here.

Grazing, in the view of local ranchers and officials like Mr. Noel, "can be one of the best tools to use to improve watersheds, to improve forage, to improve soil structure on public lands."
Grass grows better when cut back, Mr. Noel said.

"Most of the herds here are very small," Mr. Noel said.

Ranching is a small and declining part of the economy of Kane and its northern neighbor, Garfield County.

The eight-year process, however, did result in some cross-pollination.
As ranchers like Mr. Robinson have warily shed suspicions and made common cause with an environmental group, the trust itself is gingerly adopting ranching to achieve conservation goals.
The purchase of the Kane and Two-Mile Ranches north of Grand Canyon National Park -- 1,000 acres of land and grazing allotments on an additional 830,000 acres -- was recently completed by the Grand Canyon Trust and the Conservation Fund, based in Arlington, Va.
Instead of retiring the allotments, they will use them, though for fewer head of cattle.

By running cattle on some of the land, the groups may inoculate themselves against new lawsuits, even as they restore acreage damaged by grazing.
Mr. Hedden, however, remains quietly angry at the circumstances that led him to abandon his campaign to use free-market tools to curb grazing.

"We solved the problems of the B.L.M., and we're hurting the Kane County economy by buying out guys who are going bankrupt?

Taming inflation is the central bank's cardinal role; it aims to keep the inflation rate hovering just under 2 percent.
To meet that goal, some economists said, a further rise in interest rates seems almost inevitable.
"There is a bit of a conflict between the bank's statement, and the numbers they gave."
He still expects another rate increase in March and a few more over the course of 2006, which would move interest rates toward a level of 3 percent by the fall.

Economists said the wait-and-see approach reflected a continuing debate in the bank's governing council about whether -- and how fast -- to tighten monetary policy for the 12 nations that use the euro.

Mr. Trichet acknowledged that some members of the council preferred a sharper increase now, while others would have been happier leaving the rate unchanged.
"It is an uncomfortable situation for the bank because the hawks will keep coming back."
In addition to managing the internal debate, he has had to contend with members of the council of opposing views, who have spoken publicly, even aggressively, about the need to raise rates or to stand pat.

There is simply no way to exaggerate its importance.

There was an immense additional amount of work by Professor Friedman in economics and econometrics, and much of it had to do with the relation of the price level, monetary aggregates, output and unemployment to each another, and especially the key role of expectations in thwarting economic policy.
In about 1965, the whole world was worshiping at the altar of John F. Kennedy's words, "Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country."
People should be asking what they can do for themselves and their friends and communities, not how they can serve the state or what they could get as wards of the state.
This became the beginning of Professor Friedman's 1980 PBS series "Free to Choose," also about the role of individual freedom in creating a prosperous, politically free society.
While (just as a humble opinion) I see the state having a vital role in securing freedom for minorities, defending the society against aggression, and delivering the mail, Professor Friedman's basic point is certainly correct.
(He saw major roles for the state in enforcing antitrust laws and insuring banks and in other areas, too.)
One of Professor Friedman's most apt students was Ronald Wilson Reagan, and another is the governor in my home state of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Now, in the autumn of his life, Professor Friedman works for school choice.
He wants to give parents vouchers so they can send their children to better schools, removing them from failing public schools.
He wants to end the state's near-monopoly on education, which has produced such disappointing results, especially among the nonrich and nonwhite.
He faces an uphill struggle (and we parents of teenagers who refuse to do homework think the return of the lash might be a better innovation), but he is in there pitching for giving poor people the same choices rich people have in education.
It can hardly be worse than what we have today.

THERE are a few really great names in standing up for the individual in a world where the beautiful people always seem to want the state to tell us how to live -- William F. Buckley; Robert L. Bartley, the late editor of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page; and Mr. Reagan -- but they all pale before the brain power and ingenuity of Milton and Rose Friedman.
If we have a free society today, if we have avoided anything close to another Great Depression, if we have prosperity and fairly stable prices, we owe much of it to Milton Friedman.
If we have a free market economy that will yet pull us through our many travails and will be the beacon of hope to the whole world, if we still have a majority of the economy not in the hands of the state, much of the credit goes to Milton Friedman.
It is not a stretch to say that when great buildings of Manhattan have vanished, intelligent people will still find inspiration in the works of Milton Friedman.
He will be in a pantheon of economists along with Adam Smith, David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill.
And he helped me find a girlfriend and kept me from getting run over.
Happy birthday, Professor Friedman, and many more to come.

Slowing economies matter because they often set the stage for recessions, and they usually drag down stock prices in any event.
By the time a recession begins and job losses are mounting, stocks are frequently rising again.

"The recession obsession is a terrible mistake," said Joseph H. Ellis, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who was ranked the country's top retail analyst for 18 straight years by Institutional Investor magazine.
"We need to find a way to talk about slowing rates of growth.
We need new language."
In a new book, "Ahead of the Curve" (Harvard Business School Press, 2005), Mr. Ellis argues that the economy's direction is easier to divine than many people think.
Cast aside the recession obsession, look beyond the torrent of confusing data each week, he says, and you can often tell what the economy's next move will be.
You still won't know when the next recession is coming, but neither do Mr. Greenspan or Wall Street's prophets.
In 2006, Mr. Ellis says, the economy will probably slow more than most forecasters predict, for the same important reason it has typically slowed at other points in the last 40 years: weak wage growth.

The forecasters polled in a regular survey by the Philadelphia Fed say they think that the economy will expand 3.4 percent next year, down from 3.6 this year.
To Mr. Ellis -- who is also the founder of Blue Tulip, a chain of gift and paper stores in the Northeast -- 2 percent growth might be more likely.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"We're probably past the peak," he said.
The key to his system is paying attention to people's paychecks and comparing them with inflation.
These checks receive less attention than the unemployment rate or job growth, but they are far more important to the economy.

Only a fraction of workers lose their job in a given year.
But all workers get paid, and the changes in their pay help determine consumer spending.
Consumer spending, in turn, makes up about two-thirds of the $12 trillion American economy.
Where it goes, industrial production, capital spending and hiring eventually follow.
For most of the last two years, wages of rank-and-file workers -- about 80 percent of the work force -- have been growing more slowly than inflation.
Upper-income households have done better, but surging energy costs this year have dented their buying power as well.

In the 12 months ending in November, the weekly pay of rank-and-file workers fell about 0.5 percent, after taking inflation into account, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
(Annual rates of change like this are another of Mr. Ellis's fixations; the month-to-month changes that are often reported by the news media are much too noisy to be useful, he says.)
Just about every other time that inflation-adjusted pay growth has slowed in recent decades, consumer spending eventually took a hit, too.
But the current federal budget deficit makes another tax cut unlikely next year.

Wage growth has not been a perfect economic predictor, of course.
Nothing is.
Corporate investment and international trade also matter.

And forms of income other than regular wages, like bonuses and stock options, are bigger than they were in past decades.
They helped keep the economy growing at a surprisingly healthy pace in 2004 and 2005 despite high energy costs and lagging wages.
The figures that Mr. Ellis tracks "are only part of the story," said James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS.
"You've had a pretty clear pattern where total wage-and-salary income has been consistently stronger."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
It is also possible that the recent tax cuts and real-estate boom have carried the economy through its danger zone.
Nominal wage growth -- that is, before accounting for inflation -- picked up this year as the job market improved.
Oil prices have recently fallen, which suggests that Mr. Ellis's favorite indicator -- inflation-adjusted wages -- might be on the verge of turning around.
Still, the economy has rarely escaped pain after years of slowing real wages, even if there is sometimes a lag.

It also earned him needling when he strayed from Wall Street's usual sunny forecasts.
Rising house values might well have played a similar role in the last couple years.
"These things can postpone a decline" in spending growth, he said, "but they can't prevent it."
If Mr. Ellis is wrong, he will have picked a bad time to commit his ideas to paper.
If he is right, Wall Street's forecasts next December will revolve around the question of whether the slowdown of 2006 will become the recession of 2007.
You can guess what their answer will be.
Often, declines in a nation's currency reflect problems like excessive government debt or faltering growth.
But in this case, analysts say, the yen's weakness reflects something different: As economic recovery raises wages and creates jobs, the Japanese are starting to feel confident enough to invest part of their savings abroad for the first time in a decade.

And even a small change in Japanese investing habits can be enough to move global markets.
Japanese households hold some $12 trillion in financial assets, one of the world's largest pools of investment capital.
"With the domestic economy getting back onto a normal footing," said Satoru Ogasawara, a currency strategist in the Tokyo office of Credit Suisse First Boston, "individuals are becoming less afraid of risk."
A lower yen helps Japanese car and electronics exporters because it makes their goods cheaper in dollars.
While that might be good news for consumers in the United States, the prospect of less expensive Toyotas threatens Detroit, which is already struggling to compete with the Japanese carmakers.

In the past, American manufacturers have asked Washington to intervene to halt slides in the yen.
But at a weekend meeting in London of finance ministers of the Group of 7 industrial nations, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow made no public mention of the yen's decline, according to news reports.

"Foreign exchange rates reflect fundamentals of economies," Mr. Tanigaki told reporters, according to Bloomberg News.
Some traders read his statement as a sign that the government would not interfere with market-driven currency movements.
Without American pressure, Japan is unlikely to intervene on its own as its economy only benefits from stronger exports.

A catalyst for the yen's decline has been a steady ratcheting up of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which has made United States Treasury bonds more attractive to investors.
To limit inflation in a robust American economy, the Fed has raised its base-line federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend money to each other, 12 times since June 2004, to 4 percent from 1 percent.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
At the same time, Japan's central bank has kept interest rates effectively near zero, and fears of snuffing out economic recovery make it unlikely that the bank will raise them anytime soon.
That has sent Japanese money overseas in search of higher returns.
In the last two years, there has been a slow shift of savings into more aggressive investments, particularly Japanese-based mutual funds that specialize in United States and other foreign securities.
According to government data, Japanese purchases of foreign securities surpassed 15 trillion yen, or $124 billion, in the first eight months of this year.
At that pace, purchases would pass $165 billion for the first time since 1986, according to analysts.
That would be a reversal from most of the 1990's, when individuals, inhibited by Japan's long economic doldrums, kept their money in the safest possible places, either in government-guaranteed savings accounts or in cash.
"The economy is getting better," Mr. Ogasawara of First Boston said, "so Japan is putting more of its money overseas again."
Monterey, Calif. - IN a plot twist that would have pleased John Steinbeck, sardines have returned to Monterey Bay decades after they supposedly vanished forever.
Though over-harvesting originally was blamed for the fishery collapse and may have been a factor, scientists have discovered that California's sardines and anchovies alternate in abundance as ocean temperatures vary over periods of about 60 years, with the relatively warm water favored by sardines now prevailing.
"I doubt if the stock will ever be as high as during the heyday," said Kelly O'Reilly, a marine biologist who tracks sardines for the California Department of Fish and Game, "but it's healthy and has increased, especially in the last five years."
No one expects sardine factories to return to Monterey -- it's simply not cost-effective anymore -- and most of the catch is shipped to overseas canneries or to the Japanese market, used as long-line bait or ground into meal and fed to farmed tuna.

Still, some fresh fish sporadically make their way to coastal California markets and restaurants, especially during the prime season of August through December when they often reach a larger size of 7 to 8 inches.

"California sardines have a richer, bolder flavor than their Portuguese cousins," said John Pisto, a chef who occasionally offers fresh sardine specials at Abalonetti and Domenico's, his two restaurants on the touristy Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey.
According to Mr. Pisto, however, the fish is a tough sell.
In San Francisco, 115 miles to the north, however, Monterey Bay sardines are popular at some high-end restaurants, whose chefs feature them whenever they're available.
At Zuni Cafe, Judy Rodgers grills them wrapped in grape leaves, uses them on pizzas and in tomato-based pasta sauce, and marinates them in chimichurri before draping them atop crostini slatherered with white bean purée.
For the Sonoma-based cookbook author Paula Wolfert, who has fond memories of fresh sardines from the years she lived in Morocco, the return of Monterey Bay sardines is a source of both frustration and pleasure.
"Sardines are very perishable and here, inland from the coast, it's hard to find them to cook at home," she said.

Marc Quattromani, Felton, Calif.: It isn’t clear to me that the administration consciously engaged in misinformation.
I think more likely they bent the rules to prove what they knew to be true.
But one factor about the pre-war case and the post war actions that is often overlooked is: Why did they think they could get away with it?
The only answer that makes sense to me is that not only did the administration fully believe that Saddam had W.M.D.’s, they expected him to use them in the war.
The misread intelligence, the botched occupation, Abu Ghraib and other prisoner scandals would have mattered for little against his demonstrated malevolence.
It must have been part of the calculus that U.S. citizens and the world at large would forgive the many mistakes once Saddam proved his viciousness by unleashing W.M.D.’s.
It is also becoming clear from various sources that the administration never considered the consequences if he proved not to have W.M.D.’s and likely didn’t consider the case of him having them but refraining from using them either.
This isn’t criminal but it is abominable decision making.
Peter Cassels, Providence, R.I.: I was astounded to learn about the USA Today/CNN/Gallup survey showing more Americans advocate a pullout from Iraq than supported a withdrawal from Vietnam in 1970.
What is truly remarkable is that public opinion has shifted without the massive antiwar protests, many of them violent, that sparked the opinion shift during the Vietnam War.
Where are the protesters today?
Without the draft, students have no motivation to protest.
They seem to be more concerned with their studies, e-mails and iPod music downloads.
Perhaps older Americans — those who remember Vietnam — such as the baby boomers, need to take up the mantle.
Suzanne Gentling, Glen Rose, Tex.
: While it is encouraging to finally hear Americans begin to engage in some kind of realistic discourse, the fact is, the truth about 9/11, the so-called war on terrorism and Saddam Hussein was pretty much apparent from the beginning.
Anyone with just a modicum of common sense could determine that the chances of two egomaniacs like Saddam and Osama colluding on anything were probably pretty slim.
While the present administration will have to take responsibility for what it has done, we, the citizens of this grand experiment called Democracy, will have to assume the ultimate responsibility.
We fail to educate ourselves and engage fully in the creation and management of our government.
We have become so superficial that we elect one who is completely unqualified for the job, simply because we allow ourselves to be fed any kind of manipulative advertising.
We have become a culture that is greedy and self-satisfied and unable to control ourselves.
And worst of all, we indulge in this victim-trip of always blaming someone else for our difficulties.
Until we have the courage and wisdom as a society to look at ourselves as we really are, our nation will only continue to deteriorate.
Is it any wonder that we are where we are?
William Powers, the media critic for the National Journal, a Washington, D.C.-based political affairs magazine, registers his annoyance that the media tracked the boom in residential real estate prices.
The media fed off the real estate bubble, and it’s easy to see why.
Suddenly, everyday people were talking about housing starts and debating the supposed macroeconomic perils of interest-only loans.
In the pre-bubble years, when Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan issued one of his mystical pronouncements on the economy, everyday readers and viewers would plug their ears and run away.
Powers wonders how the media will cover the market since it isn’t crashing and journalists love things that boom or crash, not hiss — like air being let out of a balloon.
The point he is missing is that real estate does not behave like the tech stocks.
It doesn’t crash with any of the power of the stock market because real estate is less liquid.
So it tends to flatten, and then as inventories build up, prices fall.
Many markets are building up inventory.
Winter is a slower season for real estate, but when spring comes, homeowners , and the media, will get a better image of the market direction.

The dollar's strength was a big surprise in 2005; renewed weakness could trip up investors next year, said Matthew Smith, chief executive of Smith Affiliated Capital, a New York firm that manages $1.4 billion in fixed-income instruments.
Subdued economic performance, he said, will compel the Fed to ease up on the rate increases widely credited for the currency's double-digit percentage gains this year.
"I think you'll see the dollar cracking as Fed policy goes neutral," he said.
A falling dollar should improve earnings prospects for American companies with extensive foreign sales, but the economic softening that Mr. Smith anticipates is steering him into Treasury notes with maturities of five years or less.

To show how unanticipated that is, he cited a popular indicator of market sentiment that has recorded more bulls than bears among investment advisers every month for three years, the longest such run ever.

One way to capitalize on their misfortune is to sell short shares in the Man Group, a large British hedge fund provider, as a proxy for the Standard & Poor's Hedge Fund index.

THE Federal Reserve is a modern, sensitive central bank that likes to communicate how it feels.
Its well-telegraphed signals to the market leave virtually no doubt that it will execute a 13th consecutive quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate this week; the debate among investors is whether the accompanying statement will reveal a change in mood about further increases.
Recent statements by the Fed have repeated that it will tighten credit "at a pace that is likely to be measured."
If that phrase is omitted, it will indicate that the end of the tightening cycle is near, said John K. Lynch, chief market analyst at Evergreen Investments.
"We've arrived at the point where no one cares what the Fed does and everyone cares what they say," Mr. Lynch said.
"It will be a very positive development for equity markets," he predicted.

Many big merchants can provide reliable stock data on a daily basis, once the store closes, "and that's marginally useful during most times of the year," Ms. Mulpuru said.
"But during the holiday season, when there are a lot of people chasing a handful of popular items, the store's inventory is constantly churning.
So in areas where you want it most -- with hot sellers during the holiday season -- that's where this service is most difficult to provide."
The problem is that stores may have an electronic record of items that have been unloaded from trucks, and another record of those that have been sold.
But in between, items can be stolen, misplaced by employees or simply not put on shelves, so the retailer's electronic count can differ significantly from what is available to shoppers.
And even if retailers minimize theft or misplaced goods, there is still the matter of getting that data to the Web quickly.
Because many retailers have decentralized technology systems -- where the stores hold the data until day's end, then send it to the corporate headquarters -- it is impossible to tell shoppers with any certainty that the iPod everyone wants is really in stock right now.

Circuit City is a good example.
According to Fiona Dias, senior vice president and chief marketing officer of Circuit City Direct, which includes CircuitCity.com, the company has had an inventory tracking system in place at all its stores since the mid-1980's.
Such systems are extremely expensive.
Ms. Dias and others suggested it would take tens of millions of dollars, and perhaps as much as $100 million, to build similar technology from scratch today.
To make sure that items are available for online shoppers when they arrive at the store, the stores show an item as sold out on the Web even though there may be two or three left at the store.
As for whether the company may suffer if consumers grow skeptical of such services because of other companies' lack of technological expertise, Ms. Dias said: "If anything, this will show off the pretenders -- the people who claim they have inventory, and maybe they did.
We'll be seen as the company that can do it, versus the guys who think they can do it."

Indeed, Google is hoping that simply because it is offering the service, retailers may look to sharpen their inventory tracking technology.
"Until now, what would the incentive have been?

"If it is a transformative technology, maybe this is the best thing to come along for real-time inventory management."

What is more, unlike the income tax rate, which declines when applied to lower incomes, the higher real estate transaction tax rate applies to the full sale price.
So if a home sells for just a few dollars more than $500,000, the seller must pay 42 percent more in transaction taxes on the entire amount, not just the portion that exceeds the half-million-dollar mark.

The surging real estate market has helped bail the city out of its financial troubles in recent years, and is on track to do the same next year.
Just last month, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg released updated estimates showing an extra $3.4 billion from taxes, much of it real estate related, coming in over the next two fiscal years.
The city still anticipates reduced revenues over the next few years, which, coupled with rising expenses, results in a projected deficit of more than $4 billion in the fiscal year that begins in 2007.
The report said that despite rising mortgage interest rates, which had been expected to be a drag on real estate sales, there has been little sign of a market slowdown this year.
In fact, the loans that have been approved appear to be flowing to wealthy neighborhoods in New Orleans but not to poor ones, according to a list of loans released by the government and mapped by The New York Times.

It gives other grants for home repair in certain circumstances, but only for up to $15,600.)
The slow pace of the agency's response to the hurricanes is a reason Representative Nydia M. Velázquez of New York, who is the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, called on Mr. Barreto yesterday to resign.

"We have reached a point where we need to get someone who can run the office in an effective way," Ms. Velázquez said.
"He doesn't have what it takes at a moment of crisis."
The Small Business Administration has also allowed large corporations to get $2 billion in federal contracts under the guise of being small businesses, she said, and morale at the agency is low.

Responding to the criticism, Raul E. Cisneros, the agency's director of communications, said in a statement: "Unfortunately, the current political environment in Washington, D.C., is not lacking for individuals who are anxious to throw stones.
This administration is focused on helping the people of the Gulf Coast rebuild after these devastating hurricanes."

But Republicans have also been critical of the agency's response.
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, the Maine Republican who is chairwoman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, has sharply questioned agency officials at two hearings.

Ms. Snowe also sent members of her staff to investigate the situation at the agency's loan-processing office in Fort Worth, where they found that workers have been putting in long hours but have been hampered by management missteps and a new -- and, by some accounts, balky -- computer system.

To get Small Business Administration loans, homeowners must submit applications and give the agency access to tax returns so loan officers can see if applicants have enough income available to cover the debt.
The agency also sends out inspectors to check the damaged homes, and makes sure that the loans are not used for costs already covered by insurance.
The agency checks applicants' credit histories and, for loans over $10,000, also requires collateral, just as home mortgage lenders would.

For borrowers who could not borrow elsewhere, the interest rate is about 2.7 percent on loans that can extend for 30 years; those who do have access to other credit have to pay about 5.4 percent.

For weeks, small business organizations and government officials have been criticizing the pace of similar loans the agency makes to companies; fewer than 3,000 such loans have been approved, and roughly 800 checks have been sent out, for less than $11 million.
Housing is a crucial issue in the Gulf Coast States, where hundreds of thousands of houses were damaged and close to 170,000 were destroyed, according to the American Red Cross.
But, Ms. Comerio added, "There is still this expectation that the government is going to do something to make people whole."
Indeed, less than 20 percent of Louisianans think that insurance should cover the costs of rebuilding, while more than 50 percent say that the federal government has the primary responsibilityto pay for it, according to a survey of 653 state residents released in late November by the Public Policy Research Lab at Louisiana State University.
But for even the most fortunate victims of the hurricanes, it may take both insurance proceeds and a Small Business Administration loan to give them even a chance of rebuilding.

Mr. Sciambra has also been approved for an S.B.A.

"It would be really hard to make ends meet without it," he said.
Many of Mr. Sciambra's neighbors have also been approved for such loans, according to a list of loans released by the agency and mapped by The New York Times.
Well-off neighborhoods like Lakeview have received 47 percent of the loan approvals, while poverty-stricken ones have gotten 7 percent.

"Murray is one of the last living icons in dance," said Yasuko Tokunaga, the dance division's director.
"The three pieces -- 'Schubert,' 'Index' and 'Four Brubeck Pieces' -- show the breadth and scope of his choreography."
"The works are taught with video and a live component; the live component is me and Tito," Mr. Louis said.

Mr. Louis graduated from New York University while becoming Mr. Nikolais's star dancer.
Most choreographers, including George Balanchine and Martha Graham, would extend a dance vocabulary through their choreography and then bring the "new" movement to classroom training.
"I learned a lot by teaching.
When I taught children, I wouldn't criticize them.
I said, 'Let me see your knee do that.'

Although a devoted following trekked from all parts of the New York area to the Henry Street Playhouse in the 1960's, Mr. Louis and Mr. Nikolais moved to the Space for Innovative Development, a new arts center in the garment district in 1970.
Would Henry Street Playhouse or the companies keep the earnings?
"I fed them and told them to throw out the folk songs."

Mr. Louis also choreographed for several ballet companies in Europe, although he remains unreconstructed in his faux-naïf view of ballet: "I enjoy ballet very much because it gives you something simple to watch -- like feet."
Modern dance today fares no better.
"It's like a large, luscious entity that is being bloodsucked to death by so much self-concern by people who treat dance as therapy," he said.
"They talk a lot in the dances, and it's not demonstrated in action.
"Creatively strong leaders are not coming out of dance.
What companies can young dancers get into?
Dancers break off to make little fractions, which become more little fractions.
There is a lot of splintering."

Today, Mr. Louis says he has found peace by "divesting" the houses he shared with Mr. Nikolais in Greenwich Village and Southampton, N.Y. "I just got a place in Fort Lauderdale," he said, beaming.

"We throw the ball a lot," Barber said.
"But when it comes down to it, we are an on-the-ground, grind-it-out, get-the-tough-yardage type of team."
The Giants need to win only one of their final two regular-season games, at Washington next Saturday or at Oakland on Dec. 31, to clinch the National Football Conference East division.
That would guarantee at least one playoff game at Giants Stadium, where the team is 8-1, including a "road" game against the New Orleans Saints after Hurricane Katrina.
Preparing to face the leading offense in the league and its most-prolific rusher in recent weeks, Larry Johnson, the Giants arrived Saturday to learn that linebacker Carlos Emmons would not play; his pectoral muscle was so sore he could not extend his arm.

Johnson ran through the Giants for 167 yards and 2 touchdowns.

While not as consistently proficient as Johnson, Barber ran as if occasionally drizzled in cooking oil.

Reaching first-and-goal at the Giants' 3-yard line, the Chiefs handed the ball to Johnson on three straight plays.
Different Giants -- end Osi Umenyiora, tackle Kendrick Clancy and linebacker Nick Greisen -- took turns bringing him down short of the goal line.

After converting a couple of third downs, and having reached Kansas City's 41-yard line, quarterback Eli Manning pitched left to Barber, who cut back in to avoid one would-be tackler, then back to the outside.
Four Chiefs grabbed enough of Barber to slow him down, but none tightly enough to prevent him from spinning away.
If the official score clock is to be believed, it took Barber, with all his fits and starts, 8 seconds to go 41 yards to the end zone.

Back-to-back highlight-worthy runs by Barber in the third quarter put the Giants in field-goal position again.

Syria is getting away with murder in Lebanon, and the United Nations Security Council is letting it happen.
Some Council members, including the United States, would have liked to do more to honor the urgent requests for help delivered last week by Lebanon's prime minister, Fouad Siniora.
Since the Council can take credible action only on the basis of broad consensus, Washington and its like-minded partners -- Britain, France and Denmark -- had to accept a watered-down resolution as the best that could be achieved at this time.
But this necessary compromise will do little to convince Damascus or anyone else that the international community is capable of taking effective action against a regime that exports terrorism and tramples with impunity on a neighboring country's sovereignty.

Yet in the intervening two months, the will to impose consequences on Syria seems to have all but evaporated.
Despite a follow-up report last week noting several important areas where Syria has withheld its cooperation, no serious consequences will result any time soon.
That failure to follow through comes despite further political murders, including last Monday's car bomb assassination of a publisher known for his criticism of Syria, that have fed suspicions that Syria is continuing to employ terrorism to try and impose its will on Lebanon.
As if that weren't disheartening enough, the tough-minded German prosecutor who led the U.N.'s investigation is going home with no successor yet named.
As 11th-hour ploys go in Congress, the Republican leadership lowered the bar into the permafrost by ignoring rules and slapping Alaskan oil drilling onto a must-pass bill to pay for the Iraq war.
This "victory" for the Bush administration, which may yet be filibustered in the Senate, was the prelude to an even more cynical move -- $40 billion in spending cuts that unfairly burden the poorest Americans with reductions in health care, child support and welfare.
"The Republican revolution is back," proclaimed Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, a leader of the conservative Republican "budget hawks" now trying to palm off political rope-a-dope as revolution.
Their ballyhooed savings, less than one-half of 1 percent of Congress's $14.3 trillion projected spending plan across the next five years, would be more than canceled by the next wad of tax cuts for the affluent -- up to $100 billion -- that G.O.P.
leaders are vowing to enact next year.
These same lawmakers have repeatedly fed the record deficit and debt by rubber-stamping tax cuts.
Including hurricane reconstruction aid and anti-torture strictures hardly disinfects the budget morass being left behind.
Medicare would freeze payments for home health services and reduce payments for medical imaging.
Welfare recipients would be subject to stricter work requirements.
States would be subject to new financial penalties unless they put more people to work or further reduce the number of families receiving assistance.

Aid that helps states collect child support from absent parents would be reduced.
The Bush administration worked closely with Republicans in Congress on provisions that affect student aid.
Republican negotiators said virtually all the cuts in student aid would be borne by banks and other lenders, an assertion sharply disputed by Democrats and college administrators, who said that two-thirds of the savings would be at the expense of students and their families.
Even as it makes those cuts, Congress is creating a new program for students from low-income families who are eligible for Pell grants.
The amount of aid will not be based on financial need.
To qualify, students would have to be United States citizens, have completed "a rigorous secondary school program of study" and be taking courses full time at a "degree-granting institution of higher education."

The student would have to maintain "a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0."
Juniors and seniors will be eligible only if they have declared a major in the physical or life sciences, computer science, mathematics, technology, engineering or a foreign language deemed critical to national security.

College and university groups, as well as most Democrats, opposed the overall bill.
"This is the biggest cut in the history of the federal student loan program," said David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, an umbrella group for public and private colleges and universities.

A lobbyist at the council, Becky H. Timmons, said, "Students will be paying higher interest rates than they are currently paying."
The rate would be fixed at 6.8 percent for students and 8.5 percent for parents.
The current rates, which vary with market conditions, are several percentage points below those levels.

The new aid for freshmen and sophomores is known as academic competitiveness grants.
Freshmen would be eligible for $750 grants, and sophomores for $1,300 grants.
Juniors and seniors would be eligible for $4,000 a year in what Congress calls Smart grants.
The name is an acronym for "science and mathematics access to retain talent."
The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, said the new support for math and science education would increase America's ability to compete in a global economy.

"China and India are generating scientists and engineers at a furious pace while America lags dangerously behind," Mr. Frist said.

The bill would not change the maximum Pell grant, which has been $4,050 for several years.
The bill would increase the maximum amount of subsidized loans, to $3,500 and $4,500 for first- and second-year students, from $2,625 and $3,500.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the math and science program would abandon the Pell grant principle that the neediest students should receive the most help.

"Under this proposal," Mr. Kennedy said, "a single mother who can attend college only part time because she has to work 40 hours a week to put food on the table will not be eligible for a penny in new grant aid."
Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Education and the Work Force, said the bill would increase benefits for some students while saving money for taxpayers.

"Vast increases in federal student aid" have coincided with a decade of tuition increases, Mr. Boehner said.
He suggested that federal investments in higher education had contributed to "the college cost explosion that is squeezing the budgets of low- and middle-income families."
Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, said the Republican proposals would make it even harder for many families to pay for college.
But Mr. Stark, 57, is unlikely to inherit Mr. Issing's research role, according to several analysts who watch the bank.
Without Mr. Issing's army of economists and statisticians, these observers said, Mr. Stark may not be able to exert as much influence over policy debates.

"Issing is the last legacy of a monetarist approach that can trace its roots back to the 1970's," said Allan Saunderson, the chairman of Eurozone Advisors, a consulting firm in Frankfurt.
"Now there will be a break, and that's a good thing because the world has changed."
The timing is significant because the European Central Bank raised rates this month for the first time since 2000, and its governing council is debating how much further it should tighten policy.
The council -- comprising the 6 board members and the 12 heads of the national central banks in the monetary union -- is divided as to whether Europe needs tighter credit to curb inflation.

Mr. Issing, analysts say, lines up squarely on the side of those who worry more about rising prices.
And because he makes a presentation to the governing council before each monthly meeting at which it sets interest rates, his voice carries considerable weight in the deliberations.

"You'll see continuity until the end of May, which probably means they'll raise rates by another quarter-point in March," Mr. Saunderson said.
"But then the next guy will change things."

The board will not reassign Mr. Issing's duties until after he leaves, according to a spokeswoman.
But speculation is already coalescing around the bank's vice president, Lucas Papademos, who once worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Mr. Papademos would bring a broader economic approach to monetary policy, some analysts say.

"Papademos has always come across as extremely well balanced," said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank.
"That would make him a very good chief economist for the E.C.B."
The European Central Bank is not nearly as dominated by a single person as the Federal Reserve has been under Alan Greenspan.
The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has a diplomatic style, and says decisions are made by consensus.
But critics say the Bundesbank, based in a Frankfurt suburb, still casts too much of a shadow over its downtown neighbor.
Mr. Issing was previously the chief economist at the Bundesbank, and he has done much to transplant its philosophy.
Mr. Stark's appointment would put another Bundesbank alumnus at the heart of the bank.
But bank watchers speculate he will be assigned to a less sensitive area like international affairs.
Power at the bank will be diffused in the future anyway, analysts say, as 10 new countries adopt the euro.
But as the media and cultural landscape surrounding Mr. Wenner shifts yet again, his stewardship of his company will be squarely tested in coming months.
For one thing, he will be taking on expanded editorial and management duties amid Mr. Brownridge's sudden departure and a daunting operating environment for magazines generally.
In Mr. Wenner's well-thumbed and sometimes loopy playbook, however, management has had a highly elastic definition.
Since starting Rolling Stone as an ambitious, roly-poly 21-year-old, he has kept his own erratic hours and recruited and disposed of legions of top-notch journalistic and business talent.

MR. WENNER'S shop is built on the backs of three magazines, only two of which, Rolling Stone and the celebrity-gossip powerhouse US Weekly, have clear identities on the newsstand.
The third, the outdoor-adventure title Men's Journal, has struggled for years to find its voice.
All of the magazines, whatever their merits, offer different strategic prospects.
Rolling Stone, for instance -- while remaining the heavyweight of music magazines, with circulation, influence, quality and profitability that towers over more newly minted competitors -- has gathered some moss.
The first names that spring to Mr. Wenner's lips as members of the magazine's "big family" are largely those of singers familiar to a more wizened crop of fans, not more au courant musicians like Usher, 50 Cent, Green Day, Alicia Keys or the Black Eyed Peas.
Readers younger than 40 are also apt to miss the significance of the coming "Sgt.
Rolling Stone's political and social coverage has been inconsistent in recent years and only occasionally evokes the heat that once made the magazine a centerpiece of the cultural dialogue for the under-30 set.
Within the Wenner Media firmament, US Weekly -- a darling among women decades younger than Mr. Wenner -- is now more profitable than Rolling Stone, according to current and former Wenner employees.
US Weekly has also emerged as a more vibrant symbol than Rolling Stone of the company's mass-market traction.
Mr. Brownridge's departure, which seems to have surprised almost everyone in the industry except Mr. Wenner and Mr. Brownridge himself, touched off a flurry of media speculation that Wenner Media might wind up on the auction block.

The print media industry as a whole, meanwhile, confronted with rising costs and the migration of readers and advertising dollars to the Internet, is enduring a seismic reorientation.
And Wenner Media is not immune, despite annual revenue of $300 million to $400 million, according to Mr. Wenner, and profits that current and former company employees said would be in the $100 million range this year.
"There aren't too many privately owned companies left, and Wenner Media does have a very special place in the industry," said Andrew J. Buchholtz, a managing director at Veronis Suhler Stevenson, a firm that invests in media properties.
"But the industry has issues, and there are many risks associated with the magazine business these days."

For his part, Mr. Brownridge, slumped behind his desk and pondering an interviewer's questions with an exacting mirthlessness worthy of Emperor Palpatine, concurred.
"We're primarily a magazine publishing company, and magazine publishing as an industry is facing huge, serious challenges," he said.
"We're all like little ships on the sea, and the sea is rough."

Wenner Media remains, of course, Mr. Wenner's baby.
He is the company's controlling shareholder, and his magazines' financial fruits have taken him from blue jeans and San Francisco's old warehouse district to bespoke suits, a private jet, luxurious homes and Manhattan power lunches.
He has come to embody the elements and the contradictions of the old, 1980's Rolling Stone marketing pitch that if the perception of the magazine and its readers were a roach clip, the reality was a money clip.
Comfortable with numbers though hardly a number-cruncher, Mr. Wenner plans to take on most of Mr. Brownridge's financial chores while juggling the lead editing role at Men's Journal after abruptly firing its editor in October.
Unexpected comings and goings have been common at Wenner Media over the years, and many current and former employees, who requested anonymity because of concerns about retribution, complain about what they describe as his mercurial, Captain Queeg-like proclivities.
Mr. Wenner brooks none of this.
He acknowledges that he may have been fickle in his younger years but says he no longer launches his missiles without warning.
Furthermore, he said, he has stayed in business for 40 years because he respects and nurtures creative people.

"I don't want to get into individual cases, but I would tell you that in terms of the handling and the management of talent, and appreciation of talent, I think I'm great at that," he said.
"I know how to handle it and do it correctly and how to stay out of the way of it and how to bring it along and not smother it and not compete with it."

And the future, he says, is rosy.
"They'll be around forever, magazines, for a long time, for as long as there are trees, they'll be around.
Because they do different things than the Internet," he said.
"It's all organized for you and well selected and it's cheap still and it's just an efficient way; carryable in your back pocket.
It's still a good technical product."

Mr. Wenner followed a circuitous path to San Francisco.
"I have a feeling that I never would have gotten that book done if it wasn't for Rolling Stone."
Rolling Stone's symbiotic -- and Mr. Wenner's occasionally overly cozy -- relationship with the music industry also proved to be a magnet for record ads and a younger readership.
Rolling Stone rode a second wave of financial bliss when the all-music channel MTV made its debut in the early 1980's, further stoking the music market.

Laced through all of this was Rolling Stone's investigative and political coverage, which put it on the map journalistically.
Mr. Wenner continues to wear his political beliefs on his sleeve -- and on his wall.
Rolling Stone covers of Democratic presidential candidates ranging from George McGovern to John Kerry hang outside his office, a number of them dutifully signed by the candidates.
Mr. Wenner has a longstanding fascination with celebrity and Hollywood, drops names like "Mick" and "Bruce" with disarming ease, and notes that he calls "Yoko" every year on the anniversary of Mr. Lennon's death.

Mr. Wenner's starry-eyed infatuation with entertainers led him to buy a stake in US Weekly in 1985, before acquiring it outright four years later.
Today, Disney maintains the stake in US Weekly.
But Mr. Wenner and Mr. Brownridge stuck by US Weekly, and they now have a winner on their hands.
That performance, however, may be tough to continue amid a glut of gossip magazines and an uncertain ad market.

"That's a new one on me."

Mr. Wenner says that Ms. Fuller's successor, Janice Min, has given US Weekly even greater buzz than Ms. Fuller.
He also says he gets along swimmingly with Ms. Min, noting that she won her own editor-of-the-year award -- and that it hasn't threatened their relationship.
"That has been incredibly gratifying."
EVEN so, Ms. Min is said by several people familiar with her thinking to bridle privately at what she sees as Mr. Wenner's meddling and bullying.
They say, for example, that he forced her against her wishes to run a recent cover featuring the actress Julia Roberts and that the issue sold poorly.

Men's Journal's former editor, Michael Caruso, joined the magazine in 2003 with a strong reputation earned as a top editor at a series of other magazines.
Besides having editorial differences with Mr. Wenner, Mr. Caruso grew uncomfortable with what current and former Wenner Media employees describe as Mr. Wenner's pressure on the staff of Men's Journal to secure expensive outdoor gear for him free from companies with products the magazine reviewed.
Mr. Wenner is an avid skier and outdoorsman, and Mr. Neschis said that Mr. Wenner simply participates occasionally in the reviewing process -- a practice, he said, that "is quite common in the magazine business."
Mr. Wenner described claims that he pressured staff members for free goods as "bogus," adding: "Did I get free goods?
Absolutely.
I don't deny even asking for free skis, but I never once improperly influenced anybody at the magazine in terms of reviews."

Some current and former Wenner Media employees say that price of entry to a company owned by a hands-on founder with his own celebrity status and an undeniable eye for talent is unpredictability.
The trade-off, they say, is worth it.
"I don't think anyone would say it's an easy place to work, but there is talent there that Jann has been able to nurture over a long period of time," said Robert F. Gregory, a former Wenner Media executive who now works for Dennis Publishing Inc., which publishes Maxim.
"What's often overlooked are his persistence and his relentlessness when his instincts tell him something is right."

Indeed, while Mr. Wenner has had fallings-out with many of gifted Rolling Stone staff members and, according to insiders, has treated others -- such as the long-serving former editors Bob Wallace, Bob Love and Terry McDonnell -- with a certain cold-bloodedness when he thought that they no longer served his purposes, some at that magazine say that things there are relatively stable compared to other Wenner Media fiefs.
Will Dana, Rolling Stone's managing editor, describes Mr. Wenner's relationship with the magazine as "intense," and sees it as a positive influence.
"Jann might change his mind three times, but it's easier than having an owner you're never certain about," Mr. Dana said.
"It's rarely about anything but the work.
It's not personal."
But Mr. Wenner's influence over Rolling Stone, however inspired during its salad days, has also been limiting.
He has also been overly tentative about expanding onto the Internet, where musical downloads, streaming video and blogs have come into their own.
The Rolling Stone brand, still potent but lacking the oomph of old, was never extended into radio or cable television, and the magazine, which maintains a masthead that has historically been largely white, has been slow to cover musical genres like hip-hop.

"I still think Rolling Stone is the most important music magazine there is," said Touré, an African-American contributor to the magazine who recently wrote one of its infrequent hip-hop cover articles.
"At the same time, it is not as influential as it was in the 80's, and it's sort of dwarfed by what it was then."

Mr. Wenner says he has not ignored non-rock genres like hip-hop, even though his core readership doesn't have a significant interest in them.
"There's not a group, a musical style, a cultural moment that's come along that we have missed -- and that includes hip-hop, which we were on very early," he said "We have given hip-hop an extraordinarily large amount of space."
"The competition for good editors and writers who are black is so intense.
I mean, everybody wants them," he said.
"It's not conscious, and it's odd because we as a magazine have probably covered black culture with more depth, more frequency, more volume than any other magazine in this country in the last 40 years other than ones that are strictly black publications."

Mr. Wenner says he now sees the Internet as a "powerful threat" to print media and television.
Over the next year, he says, he will devote ample resources and time to ramping up all three of his publications' presence in cyberspace.
As he does so, he will be doing it without Mr. Brownridge, who has been with the company since 1974, serving as general manager -- and Mr. Wenner's de facto No.
2 -- since 1982.
WHILE many current and former Wenner Media employees use the words "ruthless" and "tightwad" to describe Mr. Brownridge, just as many others say he brought an invaluable business acumen and competitiveness to the company that kept the editorial and publishing trains, as well as Mr. Wenner himself, running on time.
They voice concern that Mr. Wenner may have difficulty juggling Wenner Media's properties without his deputy.

Mr. Wenner notes that Mr. Brownridge is 65, that both men agreed that the time had come for him to retire, and that he will stay on as a consultant to the company.
Mr. Brownridge himself hesitates a moment when asked if he is ready to step down as general manager.
"In other ways I feel that it will be a personal adjustment and a professional adjustment that will take time getting used to."

Asked whether he felt a sense of loss regarding Mr. Brownridge's exit, Mr. Wenner is unusually succinct.
"I'll miss Kent, but a loss like I'm mourning something or a death or something, no, not at all," he said.
"There's no executive shake-up going on, no savior is coming in from the outside, every position here is solid, his duties can be easily redistributed."
Mr. Wenner also says his hand remains firmly on the corporate tiller.
The news media have described his wife as owning 51 percent of Wenner Media, but Mr. Wenner said that he, in fact, has always been the controlling shareholder.
But the Wenners remain married and are raising their sons jointly.
"I'm a strong believer in all of that, but that doesn't mean I'm taking a vow of poverty or that I'm going to blow up animal testing centers or anything like that," he said.
"It's like, wow, this has been an amazing magazine success story."

And he is looking forward to Rolling Stone's 40th birthday party in 2007.
"I think you'd have to do that, because by the 45th I'll be in my wheelchair, so let's go get it now," he said.
In a year end package of the important words of 2006, David Leonhardt examines the use of the word frothy, as in, “at a minimum, there’s a little froth” in the housing market.
Part of its allure is simple: it’s a fun word to say, one that conjures the image of a baby’s bath or a hot cappuccino.
But “froth” – like “frothy,” which has become more common since May – has the added virtue of describing the nation’s real estate obsession in a more nuanced way than “bubble” does.

Economists say prices gained for the right reasons last month.
The biggest factor was an increase in spending by Japanese consumers, who appear to be loosening their purse strings because they have been earning more.

But the good news also set off a rare public debate among Tokyo policy makers over the government's handling of the recovering economy.
The bank's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, has set increases in the consumer price index as one condition to be met before ending the bank's super-easy monetary policy, adopted in 2001.
The bank has held interest rates near zero and pumped money into the economy to encourage banks to keep lending and write off bad loans.
Mr. Fukui has repeatedly said that he wants to end this policy, adopted during a financial crisis, once the economy is strong enough.
Politicians have said they fear that a premature tightening may snuff out growth and plunge the economy back into recession.
On Tuesday, some of the nation's top financial officials called on the central bank not to move too quickly and to follow the government's lead.
"It is up to the B.O.J.
to decide monetary policy," Kaoru Yosano, the economics and financial services minister, was quoted by Reuters as saying.
"We can give them our opinions, but the government should respect the B.O.J.
's decision."
The share has increased since 1998, when it hit a low of 17 percent before house prices began rising sharply in many places.
Although the overall level has reached its highest point since 1989, it remains well below the levels of the early 1980's, when it topped 30 percent.

"This is a good deal -- a good, fair price," Dale Ruttenberg, a 53-year-old bar manager said of a tan one-bedroom bungalow, with a remodeled kitchen and finished hardwood floors, that he is buying for $211,000 after having rented in Portland for most of the last decade.

In high-profile places like New York and Los Angeles, home to many of the people who study and write about real estate, families buying their first home often must spend more than half of their income on mortgage payments, far more than they once did.
But the places that have become less affordable over the last generation account for only a quarter of the country's population.
Elsewhere, families tend to spend far less on housing.
In Dallas, the share of income needed to buy a typical house has fallen to 13 percent this year, from 14 percent in 1995 and 31 percent in 1980.
In Tampa, it has dropped to 21 percent, from 26 percent in 1980.
Even in New England, where the soaring prices of the last decades have frustrated many young families, house values have still not reached the heights of the early 1980's, when calculated as a share of income.

"Over 20 years, affordability has definitely improved because interest rates are much lower," said Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Research at the University of California, Berkeley.
Houses have also grown bigger during that time, he said, so people are getting more for their money.

With many suburban houses now selling for $300,000 and up, young families have a much harder time buying their first home than they did a few years ago.
Still, housing has been less expensive this year -- as a share of local incomes -- than at any point during the 1980's, according to Moody's Economy.com.
Beyond cost, many families who simply could not have bought a house 10 or 20 years ago find themselves able to do so, thanks to changes in the ways banks lend money.
In the past, a home buyer often needed to make a down payment equal to 20 percent of a house's value to get a mortgage; today, little or no down payment is common.

But even though these lower down payments mean home buyers are taking out loans equal to a larger share of a house's price than in the past, monthly payments have remained reasonable in much of the country.

The sharp fall in mortgage rates -- from above 10 percent through most of the 1980's to less than 6 percent in the last few years -- is the main reason.
Upfront mortgage fees have also dropped to about a third of a percentage point of a loan's value, from 2.5 percent 20 years ago.
Computers have made lenders more efficient, and huge pools of global capital have brought more competition to a business that was once largely local.
But when the list prices of houses are climbing as they have in recent years, it can be hard to imagine that real estate is more affordable than it once was.

One possible reason for the perception is that many families have recently taken on mortgage debt to pay for items other than housing.
Some have folded higher interest loans, like credit card debt, into their mortgage, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com.
Others have used home equity loans to pay for a new car, tuition or even a vacation.
This has caused mortgage payments to rise over the last generation -- especially among high-income families, according to Federal Reserve data -- for reasons besides the cost of housing.

But the monthly payments needed to buy a house still seem to be dictating people's behavior, if not their perceptions.

"I walked away thinking I'm getting a bargain," said Mr. Muncie, 36, a psychologist.
The median-earning family in the Portland area would need to spend about 23 percent of its pretax income on mortgage payments for a typical house this year, down from about 27 percent for much of the 1980's.
But it is up sharply from the low of 16 percent reached in 1999, and some people here said the cost of housing has become onerous again.

With mortgage rates having inched up in recent months, houses are taking longer to sell, and asking prices have dropped.
Homes that would have sold for $300,000 this summer are now selling for about $285,000, said Rita Yarnold, president of Bay Realty.
The market has also slowed in California and most other places where housing costs have risen far more rapidly than in Maine.
In New York, the median-earning family would have to spend about half its income on the mortgage payments for a median-priced house, up from a third of its income in 1985.
That will act as a drag on house prices in coming years, many economists say.
"When you get affordability stretched so much, all the creative financing in the world can't stop some correction of house prices," Mr. Rosen, the University of California economist, said.
It looks as if it may not happen, though, in most of the United States.

ROBUST, FOR NOW -- While economists and bond traders fretted that short-term interest rates briefly rose above long-term rates -- often a sign that a recession is coming -- consumers grew significantly more optimistic about the economy, at least for now.
The index is now nearing the 105.5 level last recorded before Hurricane Katrina sent energy prices soaring and raised fears of an economic slowdown.
Consumers are still anxious about keeping their jobs, a sentiment that might be assuaged when statistics on job creation are released next week.

On Kumasi's Wednesday festival day, I've seen visitors from England and the United States wince at what they regard as the intrusion of modernity on timeless, traditional rituals -- more evidence, they think, of a pressure in the modern world toward uniformity.
They react like the assistant on the film set who's supposed to check that the extras in a sword-and-sandals movie aren't wearing wristwatches.
And such purists are not alone.
In the past couple of years, Unesco's members have spent a great deal of time trying to hammer out a convention on the "protection and promotion" of cultural diversity.

The contradictions in this argument aren't hard to find.
This same Unesco document is careful to affirm the importance of the free flow of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression and human rights -- values that, we know, will become universal only if we make them so.
What's really important, then, cultures or people?
In a world where Kumasi and New York -- and Cairo and Leeds and Istanbul -- are being drawn ever closer together, an ethics of globalization has proved elusive.
The right approach, I think, starts by taking individuals -- not nations, tribes or "peoples" -- as the proper object of moral concern.
It doesn't much matter what we call such a creed, but in homage to Diogenes, the fourth-century Greek Cynic and the first philosopher to call himself a "citizen of the world," we could call it cosmopolitan.
Cosmopolitans take cultural difference seriously, because they take the choices individual people make seriously.
But because cultural difference is not the only thing that concerns them, they suspect that many of globalization's cultural critics are aiming at the wrong targets.
Yes, globalization can produce homogeneity.
But globalization is also a threat to homogeneity.
You can see this as clearly in Kumasi as anywhere.
One thing Kumasi isn't -- simply because it's a city -- is homogeneous.
English, German, Chinese, Syrian, Lebanese, Burkinabe, Ivorian,

Nigerian, Indian: I can find you families of each description.
I can find you Asante people, whose ancestors have lived in this town for centuries, but also Hausa households that have been around for centuries, too.
There are people there from every region of the country as well, speaking scores of languages.
But if you travel just a little way outside Kumasi -- 20 miles, say, in the right direction -- and if you drive off the main road down one of the many potholed side roads of red laterite, you won't have difficulty finding villages that are fairly monocultural.
The people have mostly been to Kumasi and seen the big, polyglot, diverse world of the city.
Where they live, though, there is one everyday language (aside from the English in the government schools) and an agrarian way of life based on some old crops, like yams, and some newer ones, like cocoa, which arrived in the late 19th century as a product for export.
They may or may not have electricity.
(This close to Kumasi, they probably do.)
When people talk of the homogeneity produced by globalization, what they are talking about is this: Even here, the villagers will have radios (though the language will be local); you will be able to get a discussion going about Ronaldo, Mike Tyson or Tupac; and you will probably be able to find a bottle of Guinness or Coca-Cola (as well as of Star or Club, Ghana's own fine lagers).
But has access to these things made the place more homogeneous or less?
And what can you tell about people's souls from the fact that they drink Coca-Cola?

It's true that the enclaves of homogeneity you find these days -- in Asante as in Pennsylvania -- are less distinctive than they were a century ago, but mostly in good ways.
More of them have access to effective medicines.
More of them have access to clean drinking water, and more of them have schools.
Where, as is still too common, they don't have these things, it's something not to celebrate but to deplore.
And whatever loss of difference there has been, they are constantly inventing new forms of difference: new hairstyles, new slang, even, from time to time, new religions.
No one could say that the world's villages are becoming anything like the same.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
So why do people in these places sometimes feel that their identities are threatened?
Because the world, their world, is changing, and some of them don't like it.
The pull of the global economy -- witness those cocoa trees, whose chocolate is eaten all around the world -- created some of the life they now live.
That prospect is unsettling for some people (just as it is exciting for others).
Missionaries came awhile ago, so many of these villagers will be Christian, even if they have also kept some of the rites from earlier days.
But new Pentecostal messengers are challenging the churches they know and condemning the old rites as idolatrous.
Again, some like it; some don't.
Above all, relationships are changing.
When my father was young, a man in a village would farm some land that a chief had granted him, and his maternal clan (including his younger brothers) would work it with him.
When a new house needed building, he would organize it.
He could expect to pass the farm and the responsibilities along to the next generation.
Nowadays, everything is different.
Cocoa prices have not kept pace with the cost of living.
Gas prices have made the transportation of the crop more expensive.
And there are new possibilities for the young in the towns, in other parts of the country and in other parts of the world.
Once, perhaps, you could have commanded the young ones to stay.
Now they have the right to leave -- perhaps to seek work at one of the new data-processing centers down south in the nation's capital -- and, anyway, you may not make enough to feed and clothe and educate them all.
So the time of the successful farming family is passing, and those who were settled in that way of life are as sad to see it go as American family farmers are whose lands are accumulated by giant agribusinesses.
We can sympathize with them.
But we cannot force their children to stay in the name of protecting their authentic culture, and we cannot afford to subsidize indefinitely thousands of distinct islands of homogeneity that no longer make economic sense.

Nor should we want to.
Human variety matters, cosmopolitans think, because people are entitled to options.
What John Stuart Mill said more than a century ago in "On Liberty" about diversity within a society serves just as well as an argument for variety across the globe: "If it were only that people have diversities of taste, that is reason enough for not attempting to shape them all after one model.
But different persons also require different conditions for their spiritual development; and can no more exist healthily in the same moral, than all the variety of plants can exist in the same physical, atmosphere and climate.
The same things which are helps to one person towards the cultivation of his higher nature, are hindrances to another.. .
.Unless there is a corresponding diversity in their modes of life, they neither obtain their fair share of happiness, nor grow up to the mental, moral, and aesthetic stature of which their nature is capable."
If we want to preserve a wide range of human conditions because it allows free people the best chance to make their own lives, we can't enforce diversity by trapping people within differences they long to escape.

Even if you grant that people shouldn't be compelled to sustain the older cultural practices, you might suppose that cosmopolitans should side with those who are busy around the world "preserving culture" and resisting "cultural imperialism."
Yet behind these slogans you often find some curious assumptions.
Take "preserving culture."
It's one thing to help people sustain arts they want to sustain.
I am all for festivals of Welsh bards in Llandudno financed by the Welsh arts council.
Long live the Ghana National Cultural Center in Kumasi, where you can go and learn traditional Akan dancing and drumming, especially since its classes are spirited and overflowing.
Restore the deteriorating film stock of early Hollywood movies; continue the preservation of Old Norse and early Chinese and Ethiopian manuscripts; record, transcribe and analyze the oral narratives of Malay and Masai and Maori.
All these are undeniably valuable.
But preserving culture -- in the sense of such cultural artifacts -- is different from preserving cultures.
And the cultural preservationists often pursue the latter, trying to ensure that the Huli of Papua New Guinea (or even Sikhs in Toronto) maintain their "authentic" ways.
What makes a cultural expression authentic, though?

"They have no real choice," the cultural preservationists say.
"We've dumped cheap Western clothes into their markets, and they can no longer afford the silk they used to wear.
But this is no longer an argument about authenticity.
The claim is that they can't afford to do something that they'd really like to do, something that is expressive of an identity they care about and want to sustain.
This is a genuine problem, one that afflicts people in many communities: they're too poor to live the life they want to lead.
But if they do get richer, and they still run around in T-shirts, that's their choice.
Talk of authenticity now just amounts to telling other people what they ought to value in their own traditions.
Not that this is likely to be a problem in the real world.
People who can afford it mostly like to put on traditional garb -- at least from time to time.
Andrew Oransay, the islander who piped us up the aisle, whispered in my ear at one point, "Here we all are then, in our tribal gear."
In Kumasi, people who can afford them love to put on their kente cloths, especially the most "traditional" ones, woven in colorful silk strips in the town of Bonwire, as they have been for a couple of centuries.
(The prices are high in part because demand outside Asante has risen.
A fine kente for a man now costs more than the average Ghanaian earns in a year.
Is that bad?
Not for the people of Bonwire.)

Besides, trying to find some primordially authentic culture can be like peeling an onion.
The textiles most people think of as traditional West African cloths are known as Java prints; they arrived in the 19th century with the Javanese batiks sold, and often milled, by the Dutch.
The traditional garb of Herero women in Namibia derives from the attire of 19th-century German missionaries, though it is still unmistakably Herero, not least because the fabrics used have a distinctly un-Lutheran range of colors.
Should we reject it for that reason as untraditional?
How far back must one go?
Should we condemn the young men and women of the University of Science and Technology, a few miles outside Kumasi, who wear European-style gowns for graduation, lined with kente strips (as they do now at Howard and Morehouse, too)?
Cultures are made of continuities and changes, and the identity of a society can survive through these changes.
Societies without change aren't authentic; they're just dead.

The preservationists often make their case by invoking the evil of "cultural imperialism."
Their underlying picture, in broad strokes, is this: There is a world system of capitalism.
It has a center and a periphery.
At the center -- in Europe and the United States -- is a set of multinational corporations.
Some of these are in the media business.
The products they sell around the world promote the creation of desires that can be fulfilled only by the purchase and use of their products.
They do this explicitly through advertising, but more insidiously, they also do so through the messages implicit in movies and in television drama.
Herbert Schiller, a leading critic of "media-cultural imperialism," claimed that "it is the imagery and cultural perspectives of the ruling sector in the center that shape and structure consciousness throughout the system at large."

That's the theory, anyway.
But the evidence doesn't bear it out.
Researchers have actually gone out into the world and explored the responses to the hit television series "Dallas" in Holland and among Israeli Arabs, Moroccan Jewish immigrants, kibbutzniks and new Russian immigrants to Israel.
They have examined the actual content of the television media -- whose penetration of everyday life far exceeds that of film -- in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India and Mexico.

And one thing they've found is that how people respond to these cultural imports depends on their existing cultural context.
It fortified his view that "if a guy can tell a woman that he loves her, she should be able to do the same."
What's more, after watching the show, Sipho "realized that I should be allowed to speak to my father.
He should be my friend rather than just my father."
It seems doubtful that that was the intended message of multinational capitalism's ruling sector.
But Sipho's response also confirmed that cultural consumers are not dupes.
They can adapt products to suit their own needs, and they can decide for themselves what they do and do not approve of.
Here's Sipho again:
"In terms of our culture, a girl is expected to enter into relationships when she is about 20.
In the Western culture, a girl can be exposed to a relationship as early as 15 or 16.
That one we shouldn't adopt in our culture.
Another thing we shouldn't adopt from the Western culture has to do with the way they treat elderly people.
I wouldn't like my family to be sent into an old-age home."

It wouldn't matter whether the "old-age homes" in American soap operas were safe places, full of kindly people.
That wouldn't sell the idea to Sipho.
Dutch viewers of "Dallas" saw not the pleasures of conspicuous consumption among the superrich -- the message that theorists of "cultural imperialism" find in every episode -- but a reminder that money and power don't protect you from tragedy.
Mexican telenovelas remind Ghanaian women that, where sex is at issue, men are not to be trusted.
If the telenovelas tried to tell them otherwise, they wouldn't believe it.

Talk of cultural imperialism "structuring the consciousnesses" of those in the periphery treats people like Sipho as blank slates on which global capitalism's moving finger writes its message, leaving behind another cultural automaton as it moves on.
It is deeply condescending.
And it isn't true.
In fact, one way that people sometimes respond to the onslaught of ideas from the West is to turn them against their originators.
It's no accident that the West's fiercest adversaries among other societies tend to come from among the most Westernized of the group.
Not the farmers and the peasants.
Not the chiefs.

Sometimes, though, people react to the incursions of the modern world not by appropriating the values espoused by the liberal democracies but by inverting them.
One recent result has been a new worldwide fraternity that presents cosmopolitanism with something of a sinister mirror image.
Indeed, you could think of its members as counter-cosmopolitans.
They believe in human dignity across the nations, and they live their creed.
They share these ideals with people in many countries, speaking many languages.
As thoroughgoing globalists, they make full use of the World Wide Web.
They resist the crass consumerism of modern Western society and deplore its influence in the rest of the world.
But they also resist the temptations of the narrow nationalisms of the countries where they were born, along with the humble allegiances of kith and kin.
They resist such humdrum loyalties because they get in the way of the one thing that matters: building a community of enlightened men and women across the world.
That is one reason they reject traditional religious authorities (though they disapprove, too, of their obscurantism and temporizing).
Sometimes they agonize in their discussions about whether they can reverse the world's evils or whether their struggle is hopeless.
But mostly they soldier on in their efforts to make the world a better place.

These are not the heirs of Diogenes the Cynic.
The community these comrades are building is not a polis; it's what they call the ummah, the global community of Muslims, and it is open to all who share their faith.
They are young, global Muslim fundamentalists.
The ummah's new globalists consider that they have returned to the fundamentals of Islam; much of what passes for Islam in the world, much of what has passed as Islam for centuries, they think a sham.
As the French scholar Olivier Roy has observed, these religionists -- his term for them is "neofundamentalists" -- wish to cleanse Islam's pristine and universal message from the contingencies of mere history, of local cultures.
For them, Roy notes, "globalization is a good opportunity to dissociate Islam from any given culture and to provide a model that could work beyond any culture."
They have taken a set of doctrines that once came with a form of life, in other words, and thrown away that form of life.
Now, the vast majority of these fundamentalists are not going to blow anybody up.
So they should not be confused with those other Muslims --the "radical neofundamentalists," Roy calls them -- who want to turn jihad, interpreted as literal warfare against the West, into the sixth pillar of Islam.
Whether to endorse the use of violence is a political decision, even if it is to be justified in religious terms.
Nonetheless, the neofundamentalists present a classic challenge to cosmopolitanism, because they, too, offer a moral and, in its way, inclusive universalism.
Unlike cosmopolitanism, of course, it is universalist without being tolerant, and such intolerant universalism has often led to murder.
Still, many Enlightenment liberals drew the conclusion that enforcing one vision of universal truth could only lead the world back to the blood baths.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Yet tolerance by itself is not what distinguishes the cosmopolitan from the neofundamentalist.
There are plenty of things that the heroes of radical Islam are happy to tolerate.
They don't care if you eat kebabs or meatballs or kung pao chicken, as long as the meat is halal; your hijab can be silk or linen or viscose.
At the same time, there are plenty of things that cosmopolitans will not tolerate.
We will sometimes want to intervene in other places because what is going on there violates our principles so deeply.
We, too, can see moral error.
And when it is serious enough -- genocide is the least-controversial case -- we will not stop with conversation.
Toleration has its limits.

Nor can you tell us apart by saying that the neofundamentalists believe in universal truth.
Cosmopolitans believe in universal truth, too, though we are less certain that we already have all of it.
It is not skepticism about the very idea of truth that guides us; it is realism about how hard the truth is to find.
One tenet we hold to, however, is that every human being has obligations to every other.
Everybody matters: that is our central idea.
And again, it sharply limits the scope of our tolerance.
To say what, in principle, distinguishes the cosmopolitan from competing universalisms, we plainly need to go beyond talk of truth and tolerance.
One distinctively cosmopolitan commitment is to pluralism.
Cosmopolitans think that there are many values worth living by and that you cannot live by all of them.
So we hope and expect that different people and different societies will embody different values.
Another aspect of cosmopolitanism is what philosophers call fallibilism -- the sense that our knowledge is imperfect, provisional, subject to revision in the face of new evidence.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The neofundamentalist conception of a global ummah, by contrast, admits of local variations -- but only in matters that don't matter.
These counter-cosmopolitans, like many Christian fundamentalists, do think that there is one right way for all human beings to live; that all the differences must be in the details.
If what concerns you is global homogeneity, then this utopia, not the world that capitalism is producing, is the one you should worry about.
Still, the universalisms in the name of religion are hardly the only ones that invert the cosmopolitan creed.
In the name of universal humanity, you can be the kind of Marxist, like Mao or Pol Pot, who wants to eradicate all religion, just as easily as you can be the Grand Inquisitor supervising an auto-da-fé.
All of these men want everyone on their side, so we can share with them the vision in their mirror.
"I invite you to the happiness of this world and the hereafter and to escape your dry, miserable, materialistic life that is without soul.
I invite you to Islam, that calls to follow of the path of Allah alone Who has no partners, the path which calls for justice and forbids oppression and crimes."
Join us, the counter-cosmopolitans say, and we will all be sisters and brothers.
But each of them plans to trample on our differences -- to trample us to death, if necessary -- if we will not join them.
Their motto might as well be the sardonic German saying Und willst du nicht mein Bruder sein, So schlag' ich Dir den Schädel ein.
(If you don't want to be my brother, then I'll smash your skull in.)
That liberal pluralists are hostile to certain authoritarian ways of life -- that they're intolerant of radical intolerance -- is sometimes seen as kind of self-refutation.
That's a mistake: you can care about individual freedom and still understand that the contours of that freedom will vary considerably from place to place.
But we might as well admit that a concern for individual freedom isn't something that will appeal to every individual.
In politics, including cultural politics, there are winners and losers -- which is worth remembering when we think about international human rights treaties.
When we seek to embody our concern for strangers in human rights law, and when we urge our government to enforce it, we are seeking to change the world of law in every nation on the planet.
We have declared slavery a violation of international law.
And, in so doing, we have committed ourselves, at a minimum, to the desirability of its eradication everywhere.
This is no longer controversial in the capitals of the world.
No one defends enslavement.
But international treaties define slavery in ways that arguably include debt bondage, and debt bondage is a significant economic institution in parts of South Asia.
I hold no brief for debt bondage.
Still, we shouldn't be surprised if people whose incomes and style of life depend upon it are angry.

It's the same with the international movements to promote women's equality.
We know that many Islamists are deeply disturbed by the way Western men and women behave.
We permit women to swim almost naked with strange men, which is our business, but it is hard to keep the news of these acts of immodesty from Muslim women and children or to protect Muslim men from the temptations they inevitably create.
As the Internet extends its reach, it will get even harder, and their children, especially their girls, will be tempted to ask for these freedoms, too.
Worse, they say, we are now trying to force our conception of how women and men should behave upon them.
We speak of women's rights.
We make treaties enshrining these rights.
And then we want their governments to enforce them.
Like many people in every nation, I support those treaties; I believe that women, like men, should have the vote, should be entitled to work outside their homes, should be protected from the physical abuse of men, including their fathers, brothers and husbands.
But I also know that the changes these freedoms would bring will change the balance of power between men and women in everyday life.
How do I know this?
Because I have lived most of my adult life in the West as it has gone through just such a transition, and I know that the process is not yet complete.
So liberty and diversity may well be at odds, and the tensions between them aren't always easily resolved.
But the rhetoric of cultural preservation isn't any help.
Again, the contradictions are near to hand.
Take another look at that Unesco Convention.
It affirms the "principle of equal dignity of and respect for all cultures."
(What, all cultures -- including those of the K.K.K.
and the Taliban?)
It also affirms "the importance of culture for social cohesion in general, and in particular its potential for the enhancement of the status and role of women in society."
(But doesn't "cohesion" argue for uniformity?
And wouldn't enhancing the status and role of women involve changing, rather than preserving, cultures?)
In Saudi Arabia, people can watch "Will and Grace" on satellite TV -- officially proscribed, but available all the same -- knowing that, under Saudi law, Will could be beheaded in a public square.
In northern Nigeria, mullahs inveigh against polio vaccination while sentencing adulteresses to death by stoning.
In India, thousands of wives are burned to death each year for failing to make their dowry payments.

Living cultures do not, in any case, evolve from purity into contamination; change is more a gradual transformation from one mixture to a new mixture, a process that usually takes place at some distance from rules and rulers, in the conversations that occur across cultural boundaries.
Such conversations are not so much about arguments and values as about the exchange of perspectives.
I don't say that we can't change minds, but the reasons we offer in our conversation will seldom do much to persuade others who do not share our fundamental evaluative judgments already.
When we make judgments, after all, it's rarely because we have applied well-thought-out principles to a set of facts and deduced an answer.
Our efforts to justify what we have done -- or what we plan to do -- are typically made up after the event, rationalizations of what we have decided intuitively to do.
And a good deal of what we intuitively take to be right, we take to be right just because it is what we are used to.
That does not mean, however, that we cannot become accustomed to doing things differently.
The anti-foot-binding campaign, in the 1910's and 1920's, did circulate facts about the disadvantages of bound feet, but those couldn't have come as news to most people.
Natural-foot societies were formed, with members forswearing the practice and further pledging that their sons would not marry women with bound feet.
The appeal to reason can explain neither the custom nor its abolition.
So, too, with other social trends.
Just a couple of generations ago, most people in most of the industrialized world thought that middle-class women would ideally be housewives and mothers.
If they had time on their hands, they could engage in charitable work or entertain one another; a few of them might engage in the arts, writing novels, painting, performing in music, theater and dance.

How much of the shift away from these assumptions is a result of arguments?
Isn't a significant part of it just the consequence of our getting used to new ways of doing things?
If the reasons for the old sexist way of doing things had been the problem, the women's movement could have been done in a couple of weeks.
Consider another example: In much of Europe and North America, in places where a generation ago homosexuals were social outcasts and homosexual acts were illegal, lesbian and gay couples are increasingly being recognized by their families, by society and by the law.
This is true despite the continued opposition of major religious groups and a significant and persisting undercurrent of social disapproval.
Both sides make arguments, some good, most bad.
But if you ask the social scientists what has produced this change, they will rightly not start with a story about reasons.
They will give you a historical account that concludes with a sort of perspectival shift.
The increasing presence of "openly gay" people in social life and in the media has changed our habits.
And over the last 30 years or so, instead of thinking about the private activity of gay sex, many Americans and Europeans started thinking about the public category of gay people.

One of the great savants of the postwar era, John von Neumann, liked to say, mischievously, that "in mathematics you don't understand things, you just get used to them."
As in mathematical arguments, so in moral ones.
Now, I don't deny that all the time, at every stage, people were talking, giving one another reasons to do things: accept their children, stop treating homosexuality as a medical disorder, disagree with their churches, come out.
Still, the short version of the story is basically this: People got used to lesbians and gay men.
I am urging that we should learn about people in other places, take an interest in their civilizations, their arguments, their errors, their achievements, not because that will bring us to agreement but because it will help us get used to one another -- something we have a powerful need to do in this globalized era.
If that is the aim, then the fact that we have all these opportunities for disagreement about values need not put us off.
Understanding one another may be hard; it can certainly be interesting.
But it doesn't require that we come to agreement.

The ideals of purity and preservation have licensed a great deal of mischief in the past century, but they have never had much to do with lived culture.
Ours may be an era of mass migration, but the global spread and hybridization of culture -- through travel, trade or conquest -- is hardly a recent development.
Islamic states stretch from Morocco to Indonesia; Christianity reached Africa, Europe and Asia within a few centuries of the death of Jesus of Nazareth; Buddhism long ago migrated from India into much of East and Southeast Asia.
Jews and people whose ancestors came from many parts of China have long lived in vast diasporas.
None of this is modern.

Our guide to what is going on here might as well be a former African slave named Publius Terentius Afer, whom we know as Terence.
Terence, born in Carthage, was taken to Rome in the early second century B.C., and his plays -- witty, elegant works that are, with Plautus's earlier, less-cultivated works, essentially all we have of Roman comedy -- were widely admired among the city's literary elite.
Terence's own mode of writing -- which involved freely incorporating any number of earlier Greek plays into a single Latin one -- was known to Roman littérateurs as "contamination."

It's an evocative term.
When people speak for an ideal of cultural purity, sustaining the authentic culture of the Asante or the American family farm, I find myself drawn to contamination as the name for a counterideal.
And it's in his comedy "The Self-Tormentor" that you'll find what may be the golden rule of cosmopolitanism -- Homo sum: humani nil a me alienum puto; "I am human: nothing human is alien to me."
The context is illuminating.
A busybody farmer named Chremes is told by his neighbor to mind his own affairs; the homo sum credo is Chremes's breezy rejoinder.
It isn't meant to be an ordinance from on high; it's just the case for gossip.
Then again, gossip -- the fascination people have for the small doings of other people -- has been a powerful force for conversation among cultures.
The ideal of contamination has few exponents more eloquent than Salman Rushdie, who has insisted that the novel that occasioned his fatwa "celebrates hybridity, impurity, intermingling, the transformation that comes of new and unexpected combinations of human beings, cultures, ideas, politics, movies, songs.
It rejoices in mongrelisation and fears the absolutism of the Pure.
Mélange, hotch-potch, a bit of this and a bit of that is how newness enters the world."
No doubt there can be an easy and spurious utopianism of "mixture," as there is of "purity" or "authenticity."
And yet the larger human truth is on the side of contamination -- that endless process of imitation and revision.
A tenable global ethics has to temper a respect for difference with a respect for the freedom of actual human beings to make their own choices.
That's why cosmopolitans don't insist that everyone become cosmopolitan.
They know they don't have all the answers.
They're humble enough to think that they might learn from strangers; not too humble to think that strangers can't learn from them.
Few remember what Chremes says after his "I am human" line, but it is equally suggestive: "If you're right, I'll do what you do.
If you're wrong, I'll set you straight."

A year earlier, at the end of 2003, market seers were united in expecting long-term interest rates to rise.
If the conventional wisdom this year is going to be as wrong as it was the last two years, there are at least two ways for it to be wrong.
One would be for housing to continue at an extraordinarily strong pace.
An accompanying chart shows sales of single-family homes, both new and previously occupied, for 12-month periods over the last 20 years.
The totals can be a little misleading, because new home sales are usually reported when contracts are signed, while sales of existing homes are reported a month or two later, when the transaction closes.

But no sign of slowing is to be seen in those charts, and, as Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG Hoenig, notes, if the next move in long-term interest rates is down, sales could rise even more.

The stock market clearly was forecasting a decline in the housing market a few months ago.

Another way that the conventional wisdom could be wrong is that the impact of a declining housing market could be less benign than expected.
Most economists say they think that the United States economy will grow around 3.3 percent this year, a little, but not much, slower than the 3.7 percent estimated for 2005.
Another factor that could weigh on consumers, and on business investment, is oil prices.
As it happens, the last four years have all ended with spot oil prices seeming high.
What is different now are market expectations.

Now, the oil futures market sees no evidence of quick relief.
The nearby oil futures contract, expiring in February, is at $61.04 per barrel.
That is down from its peak of more than $70 reached in August, when Hurricane Katrina raised fears of oil shortages,.
but it is well above what anyone expected a year ago.
Moreover, the futures contract for the end of 2008, three years from now, sells for $61.99, a little higher than the current price.
That is persuading oil companies to step up spending on exploration and development, and there are limited signs that consumers now care more about fuel economy than they did in recent years.

The S.& P. 500, like most indexes, is calculated on a capitalization-weighted basis.
That means that the four largest stocks -- General Electric, Exxon Mobil, Citigroup and Microsoft -- account for 10.7 percent of the index movement.

"Members thought the policy outlook was becoming considerably less certain and that policy decisions going forward would depend to an increased extent on the implications of incoming economic data."

They want Chinese officials to let the yuan rise faster to make the country's exports more expensive in foreign markets.
The slowing of speculative investments "takes the pressure off" Chinese authorities to allow appreciation, said William Belchere, chief Asia economist at Macquarie Securities here.
The reduced speculation has brought measurable advantages as well: inflation has almost disappeared, even as the economy grew at a 9.8 percent rate last year.

As economists trickle back to work this week, what has particularly caught their eye in China's economic statistics was an announcement over the holidays that the nation's foreign reserves rose $9.3 billion in November, less than a third of the increase a year earlier.

Foreign reserves are the best indication of money flowing in and out.
The Beijing authorities try to maintain a stable value for the yuan against the dollar, printing and issuing yuan as needed to reflect the dollars coming into the country.
The issuing of yuan prevents an excess of dollars from circulating in China and declining in value.

But stringent measures to limit overheating of the economy and the slump in speculative investment helped bring inflation down to an annual rate of 1.3 percent in November.
The government has also tempered increases in gasoline and diesel fuel prices.
Yet the yuan has climbed just 0.5 percent against the dollar since then, although more sharply against other currencies.
It added that big fluctuations "will adversely affect China's economic and financial stability and undermine China's fundamental interests."
Speculative inflows have virtually disappeared as a result.
But even excluding the swap agreement, Chinese foreign reserves would still have increased at the same pace as in September and October and much slower than over the summer.

Moreover, growth in China's foreign reserves tends to be highly seasonal and in previous years was fastest in the autumn, when investors conclude deals begun earlier in the year.
While there are other components to the balance of payments, like workers' remittances, the rough match of the increase in reserves with the trade surplus and foreign direct investments suggested to economists that speculative investments, recently running at close to $20 billion a month, had largely evaporated.
Slower growth in currency reserves has prompted the government to slow somewhat the pace at which it recycles the money by buying United States Treasury debt -- purchases that finance American budget and trade deficits.
But economists said that because many speculators had switched from investing in China to buying short-term Treasuries to profit from rising American interest rates, this may not have much effect on the United States.

Mr. DeVecchio's lawyer, Douglas Grover, has dismissed the current inquiry as baseless, insisting his client has done nothing wrong.

The tangled tale of Lin DeVecchio, the diamond-cuff-linked agent, and Gregory Scarpa, the gangster who died of AIDS in 1994, has long stood as one of the odder stories from the underworld.
He suspected Mr. Grancio of having tried to kill him and, according to court documents, set about to seek revenge.

Now, far from homes where Christmas trees slide needle-free into storage, these two men began to prowl the darkened streets of foreign neighborhoods for the holiday detritus of others.
They found their first two trees at the corner of West End Avenue and 65th Street, lying on the ground as though overcome by too much cheer.
A fourth slumped outside a firehouse.
The sanitation workers did not pause to imagine the Christmas carols and children's smiles these trees might have conjured.

A truck like theirs can compact several hundred trees into its hold, although the number depends, oddly enough, on the borough.
A Sanitation Department survey once determined that Queens and Staten Island have the largest trees, probably because those boroughs have many single-family homes.
Manhattan, island of cramped high-rises, has the smallest, meaning more trees to a truck.

The city will not, however, collect the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, which this year is a nine-ton, 74-foot-tall Norway spruce.
The private contractor who carried the monstrous evergreen in will have to carry it out.
Trees of more modest size are compacted in the holds of trucks and taken to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island or to Randalls Island, where they are fed into wood chippers.
Their dusty remains are mixed with collected autumn leaves to create compost that is used in the city's parks, ball fields and community gardens, transforming their purpose from the aesthetic to the practical.
But Mr. Baer and Mr. Ortiz do more than simply pick up and toss.
They have to make sure that people have stripped their trees of the tinsel and lights that would make them ineligible for composting.
Trees that cling to vanity -- that insist on glittering from curbside -- are destined for the dump.

The gesture said: January.
In the eyes of many New Yorkers, chewing tobacco and its cousin, tobacco dip, is hick.
Sure, urban fashion has embraced trucker hats, Pabst Blue Ribbon and cowboy boots, but only as hip irony.
Chaw is something different.
Compared with cigarettes or cigars, these products generate small sales, and because of the way tobacco sales are measured in the city and the state, their exact revenues are unknown.
But whether their use is a fad or a smokeless reaction to the city's strict smoking rules, the proprietors of bodegas, drugstores and tobacco shops that offer chew and dip say sales are growing.
Rafas Khan, the manager at Adams Tobacco on Second Avenue, now orders a box of chew pouches every week, compared with a box every 15 to 20 days a year ago.
But fans of chew and dip still get a hard time.

But veterinarians at Cornell University Hospital for Animals, which has become a Northeast hub for dogs believed to be poisoned by the food, including Minnie, are worried.
In the three weeks since the recall, veterinarians at the hospital in Ithaca have increased their estimate of dog fatalities so far to 100 nationwide from a handful.
Some pet owners may not have heard of the recall because it was announced just before the holidays.
And aflatoxin poisoning does not always take effect quickly and can be mistaken for less serious illnesses, so Cornell has adapted a human protein test to quickly detect the toxin.
Veterinarians fear the number of fatalities could grow to several hundred in the coming months.
"I've never in my life seen anything like this," said Dr. Sharon Center, a professor of veterinary medicine at Cornell.

Ms. Patrick has lost 7 of her 25 dogs and all of the others are still sick.
Many cut short holiday plans and are still working long shifts trying to figure out how to stave off death in the dogs.
There is no antidote.
If a human contracted aflatoxin poisoning, which sometimes occurs in Third World countries, that person would need a liver transplant.
Dr. Center is giving the dogs a series of drugs to sustain them until their livers can regain some function.

Still, the fatality rate at Cornell is about 70 percent.
The dogs that survive could face lifelong liver complications and a greatly increased risk of liver cancer.
Dr. Center is fielding calls from concerned veterinarians from the East Coast, and she fears that many other pets have died at their local animal hospital or at home without the disease's being diagnosed.
The hardest calls, she said, are from older pet owners.
"They're anguished," she said.

About 1,000 people a day call in.
"They're getting hammered," said Dr. Stan Casteel, a veterinary professor who is working at the call center.
Diamond has also created an additional level of testing for aflatoxin and it will reimburse people for their veterinary bills and the cost of their lost animal in confirmed cases, Mr. Brinkmann said.

The Dow's advance has been building since last Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its December meeting, which signaled to many that the Fed would raise rates just one or two more times in the next few months.
"It's not the force that did it; it is the catalyst."
The Dow, a collection of 30 blue-chip stocks selected by Dow Jones & Company, is the longest-running major market index.
It is the one most likely to be brought up at a cocktail party or wind up in a newspaper's headline, but it is not the market's broadest or best measure.
The small size of the index and the way it weighs individual stocks limits its utility, analysts and academics that study the stock market say.

Yet, Dow 11,000 remains a powerful symbol for the ordinary investor.

The Dow's recent trading gains mirror the advances the index made when it first surpassed the 11,000 milestone, on May 3, 1999.
Before yesterday, the Dow had been hovering above 10,000 for more than 182 trading days.
Of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones average, manufacturers like Caterpillar, 3M, Boeing and United Technologies have been the strongest performers since May 1999.
The Altria Group, the holding company for Phillip Morris and Kraft foods, led the pack with a return of nearly 110 percent.
Verizon Communications and AT&T, formerly SBC Communications, have each fallen more than 47 percent since May 1999.
Merck and General Motors, which is down almost 72 percent, have posted similarly large declines.

From 1999 to 2001, the Dow rose above 11,000 on 19 occasions.
But during the last 12 months, the Dow has flirted with the 11,000 milestone twice.
By late fall, however, the Dow had climbed back to within striking distance of the 11,000 mark.

The Dow is still more than 6 percent off its record of 11,722.98, set on Jan. 14, 2000.

At the center of the story are Brad (Rory Cochraine) and Lexi (Mary McCormack), a couple contending with strains in their marriage.
The morning after a fight, Brad has just kissed Lexi off to work when the bombs go off, and the film stays with Brad as he first tries in vain to go find his wife, then barricades himself in their home with plastic and duct tape, and ultimately wrestles with the grim choice of whether to save her or himself.

Geoffrey Gilmore, the director of Sundance, praised the film's "restraint and attention to detail" on the festival's Web site, and compared it favorably to big-budget disaster movies.
He wrote, "This is ambitious and accomplished storytelling, wonderfully conceived and executed, that stands apart from similarly themed, multimillion-dollar extravaganzas that have nowhere near the tension, thoughtfulness and impact of this very independent feature."
Indeed, what makes Mr. Gorak's disaster film more of a feat is that he made it on a shoestring budget: his producers, Palmer West and Jonah Smith of Thousand Words, who hope to sell it to a distributor at Sundance, would say only that it had cost less than it would to buy a Manhattan apartment.
"And that kind of stuff is second nature to me.
I'm a firm believer in setting tight parameters, because within that box you sometimes, and hopefully more often than not, you make a stronger creative decision."

So he avoided moving from location to location, instead spending his money on extra cameras to shoot the inside of Brad and Lexi's house from every possible angle.
He contrived to have the cable television out, forcing Brad to get his information from radio -- both to avoid the expense of creating fake television-news reports and to spare the audience having to relive the 9/11 experience of being glued to the tube.
But the only reason that works is because of the world we live in.
In 'Jaws' it works because we know the shark's in the ocean.
This works because, unfortunately, we live it, and it can happen at any time."

As with other movies inspired by 9/11 -- Universal is preparing to release a film about doomed Flight 93 while Oliver Stone and Paramount have a World Trade Center drama in the works -- the inherent risk of "Right at Your Door" is whether audiences will want to watch a fictional terrorist attack unfold after having lived through the real thing in real time not so long ago.

I don't know," he said over lunch at the Farmer's Market here.
"But everything I was feeling inside for the last three or four years, and what's still going on in the world -- I guess I wanted to harness that, and wrap it up tight and throw it on the table."
And he said he had learned from the two filmmakers that "you don't have to look too far to pull this kind of story together: all this is here, it's now."
That experience -- of "feeling that the world's coming to an end and the one person I want to be with is 2,000 miles away" -- gave Mr. Gorak his sense of the desperation that can grow out of separation.

On a political scale, the ensuing war in Iraq -- which Mr. Gorak views as a gigantic diversion -- fed his outrage at what he sees as the poor preparedness of the United States for another attack on a big city.
"I understand it's an insurmountable task, but if you're going to take a step in one or the other direction, then move in the right direction," he said.
Maybe it makes someone else want to move the skirmish line back here."

"It just boils my frustration level, and makes me want to scream," he added, "and maybe this is my little punk-rock song to get it out, you know?"
What Mr. Gorak did not anticipate, though, was that his finished movie with its depiction of emergency workers promising "help is on the way," but then delivering help that is ambiguous at best -- would be eerily borne out by the flooding of New Orleans.
"And having lived there, and seeing what unfolded over that week of delay, of confusion -- I mean, I was horrified, but to hear the news reports saying, 'Help is on the way,' a line from the film, was so spooky, so saddening.

American and Iraqi officials believe that the conflicts present them with one of the biggest opportunities since the insurgency burst upon Iraq nearly three years ago.
They have begun talking with local insurgents, hoping to enlist them to cooperate against Al Qaeda, said Western diplomats, Iraqi officials and an insurgent leader.
It is impossible to say just how far the split extends within the insurgency, which remains a lethal force with a shared goal of driving the Americans out of Iraq.
Indeed, the best the Americans can hope for may be a grudging passivity from the Iraqi insurgents when the Americans zero in on Al Qaeda's forces.

But the split within the insurgency is coinciding with Sunni Arabs' new desire to participate in Iraq's political process, and a growing resentment of the militants.
Iraqis are increasingly saying that they regard Al Qaeda as a foreign-led force, whose extreme religious goals and desires for sectarian war against Iraq's Shiite majority override Iraqi tribal and nationalist traditions.

While American and Iraqi officials have talked of a split for months, detailed accounts of clashes were provided by men claiming to be local insurgents.
Despite its name, its members have nationalist and largely secular motivations.
While their membership in the insurgency could not be independently verified, the descriptions the four men offered of themselves and their exploits were lengthy, detailed and credible.
The four men interviewed are, by all accounts, ordinary Iraqis.
One worked as a trash collector.
Some of their assertions, including specific examples about clashes with Al Qaeda's forces, were confirmed by American and Iraqi officials.
According to an American and an Iraqi intelligence official, as well as Iraqi insurgents, clashes between Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and Iraqi insurgent groups like the Islamic Army and Muhammad's Army have broken out in Ramadi, Husayba, Yusifiya, Dhuluiya and Karmah.

In town after town, Iraqis and Americans say, local Iraqi insurgents and tribal groups have begun trying to expel Al Qaeda's fighters, and, in some cases, kill them.
It is unclear how deeply the split pervades Iraqi society.
Iraqi leaders say that in some Iraqi cities, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and local insurgent groups continue to cooperate with one another.

American and Iraqi officials believe that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is largely made up of Iraqis, with its highest leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian.
Even so, among Iraqis, the group is still perceived as a largely foreign force.
Evidence of the split is still largely anecdotal, and from most available evidence, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia remains the most virulent and well-financed group fighting in Iraq.

Still, its aggressive campaign to market Ms. Sonders is part of a broader initiative to provide intelligent market advice and recommendations to its clients and move beyond the bare-bones do-it-yourself model that has been the core of the firm's strategy for years.
In that vein, the firm has been sending out shiny media kits extolling the expertise of Ms. Sonders and its other analysts.
It is an approach that stands in contrast to that of many of the larger firms on Wall Street, which, in the wake of the 2000 market meltdown and the scandal over conflicts of interest involving research and opinions, have kept their strategists on a tighter leash.

At the same time, the changes in rules and procedures in recent years have also deprived policy makers of many of the tools that Tokyo once used to manage the economy.
Deregulation ended the trade and finance ministries' control of everything from foreign exchange to the interest rates that banks could pay on savings accounts.
In addition, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has significantly cut government spending on road construction and other public works, closing Japan's traditional route for spending its way out of a recession.
So, perhaps it is not surprising that now, when Japan is finally recovering, policy makers cannot seem to agree on what to do next, or even who has the final say in making policy decisions.

One of the bitterest debates involves the role of the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank.
In most developed economies, central banks lead management of the economy by setting interest rates and are given autonomy from the rest of government to prevent political interference.
The Bank of Japan, which won independence from the powerful Ministry of Finance just seven years ago, is keen to prove that it is up to the task.

But many economists and investors in Japan still lack faith in the bank.
It has been criticized for not moving more aggressively to end the deflation -- the economically damaging downward spiral in prices -- that hit Japan in the 1990's and early 2000's.
Seeking to restore its credibility, the bank wants the freedom to make one of the most important decisions now facing the Japanese economy: whether to end a radically loose monetary policy adopted five years ago that has kept interest rates near zero and essentially flooded banks with cash to avert a financial collapse.
The bank's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, has signaled that he wants to move toward tighter money for fear the current policy could touch off another bubble in the nation's rebounding stock market.

"This is a decision that should be 100 percent the Bank of Japan's responsibility," Mr. Fukui told reporters in November.

Many lawmakers have called on the bank to follow the lead of the government, which wants money to remain easy to maintain robust growth.
One of Japan's most influential lawmakers on economic affairs in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the general affairs minister, Heizo Takenaka, has even threatened to rewrite the central bank law to require the bank to cooperate with the government before acting.

Other government bodies have been criticized for failing to shift away from a crisis footing, even with the economy on sounder ground.
One is the Financial Services Agency, the bank watchdog established in the late 1990's to strengthen oversight of a banking industry in crisis over bad loans.
Now that those loans have largely been cleaned up, bankers complain that the agency continues to use heavy-handed tactics even during routine audits.
Some lawmakers say the country needs to take even bolder steps toward letting market forces rule.
They back new legislation that would further deregulate the stock market, and oppose efforts by other members of Parliament and business leaders to limit free-market activities like hostile takeovers.

"We need a new overall framework for managing the economy," said Yoshimasa Hayashi, a Liberal Democrat member of Japan's upper house who served on a special committee in Parliament for revitalizing the economy.
Economists say that behind many of the policy debates lies a larger tug of war between lawmakers and bureaucrats for control of economic policy.
But in recent years, lawmakers have expanded their powers, as a series of corruption scandals discredited the nation's bureaucrats.

Lawmakers have excluded bureaucrats from new advisory bodies like the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, a sort of economic cabinet set up by Mr. Koizumi.
While Mr. Yosano said he would not cede power back to the bureaucrats, he said he would seek to be more accommodating.

"You can't always get the best results by constantly being on the attack," Mr. Yosano said in an interview.
"At some point, you need to re-establish relationships of trust."
These conflicts also underscore what economists call a broader uncertainty in Japan over how exactly to manage a market economy, and over exactly how free the nation wants its now-revitalized economy to be.

The problem is, experts say, Japan still needs to figure out what that model will be and then, how to manage it.
Bandits prowled the southern mountains of Spain in the 19th century, smuggling, robbing and kidnapping travelers for ransom.
Now, being forced off a bus, bound at the wrists and marched through the scruffy mountains of Andalusia (below) hardly sounds like something travelers would want -- but some visitors to southern Spain are paying for just that.
Bandolero Tours, a small outfit in a town outside Cadiz, has full-day and half-day tours in which travelers are "kidnapped" and taken to the bandits' lair, where, as long as they behave, they are regaled with legends about great bandoleros (in Spanish only), and treated to flamenco shows and equestrian performances while they await rescue.
Hospitality among thieves dictates that the captives be fed well, so meals -- which include the excellent local hams, stews and rices cooked over an open flame according to 19th-century recipes -- are included.
Juan Luis Moreno Bernal, the Bandolero Tours director, explains the attraction of his program in terms of mythology.
And of course, the whole myth of 'Carmen' helps."
The kidnappings, which cost 100 euros for a full day (or $121 at $1.21 to the euro) and 50 euros for a half day, are held only for groups of 20 or more, and depart from Villamartin.

LISA ABEND
A reporter for the Arizona Republic found several people in the Phoenix metropolitan area who have decided to sell their homes and rent with the intention of buying a home when prices drop.
The reporter quotes one man who is now living in a $900 a month apartment:
“I figure interest rates will probably rise 1 to 2 percent in the next year, and people who can barely afford to buy will be priced out of the market.
“When inventories rise, and sellers lower their prices, I can jump back in.”
How much would prices have to fall before it makes sense to buy back in?
Just to break even, prices would have to fall more than the combined transaction costs of selling the house you own and the house you will buy.
That means adding up the agent commissions (you pay on both ends of the deal even if you don’t pay them directly), the taxes, transfer fees, escrow fees, mortgage fees, etc.
Will they fall that much?
Any hesitation you have in answering that question shows why housing prices don’t crash the way stock markets do — unless there is economic upheaval like a major factory closing or an industry collapsing.

"There's opportunity popping up all over the U.S.," said Greg Hulsizer, chief executive of California Transportation Ventures.

"It's not uncommon to see public-private partnerships for infrastructure around the world, especially in Europe," he said, "Here in the States, it's a new, emerging trend."
It is now a deal powerhouse; in 2004 and 2005, it bought $17 billion worth of global infrastructure assets, according to Thomson Financial.
Its model looks particularly alluring to Wall Street.
Using a small capital base, Macquarie acquires giant assets by borrowing other people's money, then packages the assets into funds, which are sold to investors through public offerings or as unlisted funds.
Along the way, it makes a killing on fees.
"It's an obvious gold mine," said one competitor who asked not to be named because his bank is working on its own infrastructure strategy.

The pitch to governments is simple: Macquarie will look after the assets -- maintaining the roads or ports, raising toll road fees to make the investment more profitable -- then give them back, in 99 years or so.

"It's not a sell-off of the family silverware," says Murray Bleach, head of Macquarie's North American infrastructure advisory business.
"You leave it with someone who can polish it up and earn more money for the use of it."
Unlike private equity funds, which look for rates of return of 20 to 30 percent, these funds expect returns in the low to high teens, according to Macquarie officials, or 6 to 12 percent, according to competitors.

Macquarie has recognized that global investors have a seemingly insatiable appetite for dependable returns of 5 to 10 percent, especially since government bond yields have been lower of late.
The potential for fees in these public infrastructure deals is astounding, even by Wall Street's obsessive and excessive fee standards.
Bankers can make advisory fees on the sale of the often-large assets.
Then, once packaged into funds, the assets earn Macquarie management fees (1 to 1.5 percent) as well as incentive fees: 20 percent on profits above a certain threshold.
The thresholds vary, based on benchmarks appropriate to the assets in the funds.

The model has risks.
Low interest rates have provided flush financing for Macquarie.
In essence, its deals are like leveraged buyouts: it provides the equity, borrows the debt and rakes in rich fees.
Higher interest rates would make debt financing less attractive and could affect returns across the board.

This week, Macquarie's chief financial officer told Bloomberg News that the bank would earn no performance fees for any of its infrastructure or specialized funds for the six months that ended Dec. 31, which will reduce the bank's revenues.

The Australian bank's model is a result of national circumstances.
A 1992 law required employers to set aside a percentage of their employees' income for retirement.
Today, workers are required to set aside at least 9 percent, which has helped build a national retirement nest egg of $591 billion, with $70 billion to $80 billion added every year -- providing a huge cushion of capital to Australian banks.
Nicholas Moore, the head of investment banking in Sydney, decided the bank should get in on the action.

Today, Macquarie has roughly $23 billion invested in what the bank calls specialized infrastructure funds.
The specialist funds have contributed heavily to the bank's bottom line.
Macquarie shares have risen more than 900 percent since they made their debut on the Australian Stock Exchange in July 1996.
Macquarie's funds are invested all over the world and trade on various global exchanges: Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust trades on the New York Stock Exchange, for example.

Macquarie's name is everywhere -- its deals have been called Macquisitions -- including a listing as a lead bidder for the London Stock Exchange.
Recently, Macquarie has bought cooling systems in Chicago, satellite parking lots at various American airports and, most recently, with Black Diamond Capital Management, the Smart Carte Corporation, the concessionaire for baggage carts and strollers at airports across the United States.
The bank is frequently accused of overpaying.
"The market says we didn't."
The bank refinanced about $1 billion of the debt in 2005, recouping about half of that for the equity partners.
The Chicago Skyway deal sheds some light on why such a concession might be attractive to governments.
In exchange, Macquarie and Cintra will operate the toll road, which generates about $20 million in cash flow a year, for 35 years.
The concessionaires will be able to raise tolls and will be required to maintain the tollway.

California has also seen advantages in doing a deal with Macquarie.
In 1991, California Transportation Ventures won the right to build Route 125, a 10-mile toll road connecting one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, Chula Vista, to a major thoroughfare.
In two deals, Macquarie bought 100 percent of the partnership rights to the concession, and the toll road is under construction.
"We get a much-needed facility without having to divert funds from other projects to build it," said Laurie Berman, deputy district director for the California Department of Transportation.

Now that most of Wall Street is rushing in, it is unclear whether there will be enough investors who want to put their money in public infrastructure funds.
And more competitors may just raise the prices of available assets.
As it grows, Macquarie will face its own challenges.
It has had only two major mistakes, investments it has since sold: a power station and a fiber optic network, both in Australia.
It cannot afford many more.
"It's not like we will make 50 percent on one asset and zero on another," Mr. Bleach of Macquarie said.
"It's more like 13, 14, 15.
We can't have any zeros."

Ford has already taken some steps to shrink its work force.
In mid-2005, it began eliminating white-collar jobs through layoffs, buyouts and leaving vacancies unfilled.

The white-collar layoffs have thrown many people back into the job market, where some have not been for years.
Recent studies say that when laid-off workers find work, they often accept jobs that pay less.

In decision research, individual differences "are regarded as a nuisance -- as just another source of 'unexplained' variance," Shane Frederick, a management science professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in "Cognitive Reflection and Decision Making."

Professor Frederick discovered striking systematic patterns in how people answer questions about risk and patience, including those above.
This short problem-solving test, he found, predicts a lot:
1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total.
The bat costs $1 more than the ball.
How much does the ball cost?
2) If it takes five machines five minutes to make five widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
3) In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads.
Every day, the patch doubles in size.
If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half the lake?

Getting the math problems right predicts nothing about most tastes, including whether someone prefers apples or oranges, Coke or Pepsi, rap music or ballet.
But high scorers -- those who get all the questions right -- do prefer taking risks.
"Even when it actually hurts you on average to take the gamble, the smart people, the high-scoring people, actually like it more," Professor Frederick said in an interview.

High-scoring women show slightly more willingness to wait than high-scoring men, while the differences in risk-taking are much larger.
High-scoring women are about as willing to gamble as low-scoring men, while low-scoring women are even more risk-averse

For instance, 80 percent of high-scoring men would pick a 15 percent chance of $1 million over a sure $500, compared with only 38 percent of high-scoring women, 40 percent of low-scoring men and 25 percent of low-scoring women.
The connection between cognition and risk preferences challenges some of the "prospect theory" developed from the pioneering work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.
The same person might take a sure $100 instead of a 50 percent chance of $300, yet prefer a 50 percent chance of losing $300 rather than a sure $100 loss.

This result, which has implications for investment and insurance, is one of the major findings of behavioral economics.
Although prospect theory "is spectacularly true" for the low-scoring group, Professor Frederick writes, high scorers treat potential gains and potential losses about the same.
Psychology studies often find that small differences in wording seem to produce large differences in survey answers.
But since these experiments are usually done on college campuses using students, the real difference may lie elsewhere.
The test groups may not really be the same.
"Most researchers are finding that subtle differences in framing cause different preferences," he said, "but it might just be that these people are a whole lot smarter on average than these other people, and that's why you're getting these results."

Currently, only about three million Americans have signed up for the high-deductible insurance policy required for such accounts, up from slightly more than one million last March, according to findings released yesterday by America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group.
It is not clear how many of those people have actually opened a linked account.
Still, the number is expected to rise sharply over the next five years.
By 2010, more than 15 million Americans, or about 10 percent of all those insured, will have a health savings account, according to an estimate by DiamondCluster International, a management consulting firm.
The average individual's account balance, it projects, will grow from $1,500 today to about $3,500 in 2010.
Even if people pull out some or all of their money to pay their medical bills, the ballooning balances may mean that $75 billion or so in new money to manage will soon be at stake.

Banks and others are drawn by the promise of lucrative fees they can generate by offering consumers mutual funds and other investment vehicles as their account balances grow.

To be sure, health savings accounts will make up only a small fraction of earnings at a financial giant like Citigroup.

Health savings accounts are akin to the private accounts that were proposed to help overhaul Social Security.

The idea behind the accounts is simple: forced to pay out of pocket for medical care, Americans workers will spend health care dollars more wisely.
The way it works is more complex.
Americans under the age of 65 with a high-deductible health care plan can contribute tax-free to the new 401(k)-like account as much as $2,700 this year for individuals and $5,450 for families, or the amount of their deductible if it is less.
Unlike health reimbursement plans, which were controlled by the employer, health savings accounts belong to employees even if they change jobs.
The money can be used to pay for medical, dental and vision expenses as well as a portion of qualified premiums for long-term-care insurance.

The rest can be invested in stocks, bonds and mutual funds -- and grow tax-free.
That money would be available to pay for a broad range of health care expenses in the future, and would remain untaxed as long as it was spent on health care.
At any time after age 65, money can be withdrawn for any reason without penalty, but the entire amount taken out would be taxed.

For wealthier people, the tax break could provide a generous incentive to build a nest egg for future health care; poorer people with smaller annual contributions could wind up spending all the money they put away during the year.

Geoff Dougall's accounting firm in Beaverton, Ore., is among the thousands of employers that have switched from a conventional health insurance plan to offering health savings account.

Banks hope to use their close ties with their customers to enter the health insurance market.
For now, they collaborate with insurance providers as much as they compete.
Health savings accounts must be opened in conjunction with a high-deductible health insurance plan.
After choosing an insurance policy, the consumer must pick a bank.
Even though the health plan and savings account are separate products, big banks and insurance companies pitch them together as an "integrated solution" and split the fees.
Health insurers keep the premiums; banks retain the investment management fees and the debit card transaction fees.
The two split the money earned for opening and maintaining the accounts.

Health insurers, said David Josephs, J. P. Morgan's vice president for health care business development, "are good at explaining benefits."

Mr. Bernanke should use his influence.
But to make the most of it, he must first show he can sustain Mr. Greenspan's extraordinary record on monetary matters.
To that end, he should re-examine his pet philosophy of centering monetary policy on an inflation target.

Mr. Greenspan has spoken out against this narrow approach, a cousin of the old method of setting a target for the size of the money supply (remember M-1?)
that he abandoned in favor of basing interest rate decisions on a vast stew of variables, all analyzed in a quest for balance between steady growth and low inflation.
Inflation targeting, which has been used with seeming success in Britain and several other prospering countries, may be a fine idea.
But with job and productivity growth in the United States high and inflation low, why do we need to start experimenting?

Even as Mr. Bernanke shows that he can manage monetary policy, he should begin to speak out on other issues, aiming particularly for those that bear on the Fed's effectiveness, like deficit control.
Wise Fed chairmen, of course, never comment on interest rates and other sensitive matters.
Nor do they issue streams of economic prognoses that are not much more likely to be accurate than those of other well-trained economists.

But warning about economic dangers should be fair game, particularly when using Fed policies would not be appropriate, as has been the case with recent asset bubbles -- high-flying stocks back in 2000; housing prices today.
Mr. Bernanke should reemphasize the deficit's impact on interest rates and stress that its meaningful reduction requires both curbing spending and raising revenue through taxes or other means.
In these matters, Mr. Bernanke's clear speaking can be put to good use.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Greater transparency about the Fed's own actions would also increase Mr. Bernanke's credibility and influence.
For starters, the Fed should release the economic forecasts prepared for meetings of its interest rate-setting body (a release that Mr. Bernanke has indicated he favors), clearly explain its interest rate decisions and provide more timely and illuminating summaries of its deliberations.
Because he lacks Mr. Greenspan's considerable political experience, Mr. Bernanke may seem at a disadvantage if he ventures beyond interest rates.
But we are sorely in need of economic wisdom, and perhaps Americans (and the politicians who represent them) are ready to heed a fresh voice.

The guest list also included Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the millionaire lawyer and ubiquitous adviser to Democratic leaders, and Peter G. Peterson, a Republican who has infuriated the White House by lambasting Mr. Bush's budget deficits.
The list underscores how Mr. Greenspan, despite being a lifelong Republican, had a knack for building friendships across the political spectrum and, almost unheard-of in today's bitterly divided capital, made few enemies in his 18-year tenure.
"He likes to be challenged by intelligent people," said Andrea Mitchell, Mr. Greenspan's wife and a correspondent for NBC News.

Mr. Greenspan is almost an institution in Washington -- ubiquitous on the party circuit and a constant dispenser of economic advice to top lawmakers and presidents, regardless of which party is in power.
Mr. Bernanke has already told lawmakers that he will keep a lower political profile.
Where Mr. Greenspan waded into explosive political debates over Social Security and tax cuts, Mr. Bernanke has vowed to stay silent on issues that are not directly tied to monetary policy.
Mr. Bernanke is a champion of greater openness and demystification at the Fed.
He would like it to publicly peg its policies to an explicit target for inflation -- an idea that Mr. Greenspan opposes because it might restrict the Fed's maneuvering room.

But for all of Mr. Greenspan's flair, from his visibility at parties to his knack for catchy phrases like "irrational exuberance," many veterans of economic policy say it is a mistake to think no one can fill his shoes.

That stopped when President Clinton took office, and has not resumed.
Current and former Fed governors say there is little disagreement between Republican and Democratic board members that the Fed's top priority is to maintain stable prices.
The debates are primarily about differing views on where the economy is headed.
But the composition of the Fed's policy-making board has changed, as Democrats have gradually left the board and Mr. Bush has named Republicans to take their seats.
Indeed, on Friday Mr. Bush nominated two Republicans, both economists who have worked in his White House, to fill open seats on the Federal Reserve Board.

One of the nominees is Randall S. Kroszner, a professor at the University of Chicago who worked on the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Mr. Bush's first term.

Mr. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary who became a particularly close friend of Mr. Greenspan during the Clinton years, said Mr. Bernanke's biggest problem may prove to be the United States' soaring trade deficit and overall foreign indebtedness.
If the imbalances lead to a crisis for the dollar or a plunge in foreign confidence about the United States, Mr. Rubin said, the Federal Reserve could face unpleasant choices similar to those that Paul A. Volcker, Mr. Greenspan's predecessor, faced in taming inflation.
"It may be that the next Fed chairman will face a challenge a little more like what Volcker faced, which is a challenge routed in the economic conditions of this country," Mr. Rubin said.
In this case, it may be the imbalances."
MR. GREENSPAN'S main accomplishment, as the tributes of the last few months have pointed out, was the taming of inflation.
He built on the success of his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, and used the Fed's biggest policy tool — the interest rate on overnight loans between banks — to keep the economy growing without letting prices get out of control.

Today, a box of cereal is just 60 percent more expensive than it was when Mr. Greenspan joined the Fed 18 years ago.
This is a big deal.
Families can afford more, and businesses can do a better job planning for the future.
Recessions come less often, and do not linger as long.
But interest rate policy is not the reason Mr. Greenspan's image is what it is.
He promoted a new flexibility, led by entrepreneurs and technological change, that is the envy of Japan and Europe.
To put it another way, he was a singular force in telling us that the unsettling changes of the last couple of decades — especially globalization — really were making us better off.
In his office hung an 1819 treatise by David Ricardo, the British economist who came up with the classic argument in favor of trade: When England specializes in cloth and Portugal in wine, they end up better off than if each tries to make everything.

But as Mr. Greenspan exits, these benefits are not the main thing on people's minds.
The costs of the changes are.
When we start buying lower-priced goods from abroad, it often means American jobs are lost.
When we embrace new technology, these productivity gains also often come at the expense of someone's job.
While that is undoubtedly true, it is not exactly a persuasive argument to unemployed workers for whom the "short term" encompasses the rest of their lives.

In recent years, even the elite consensus in favor of freer trade has begun to break down.
Around the world, trade talks are largely stalled.
Few Democrats in Congress are willing to vote for trade deals these days.
Many of us are torn.
By a wide margin, Americans still say trade is good for the economy, but a solid and growing majority also wants restrictions to protect domestic industries.

Laid-off workers need help, Mr. Bernanke said.

"Reducing the burdens borne by displaced workers is the right and fair thing to do," Mr. Bernanke said.
"If workers are less fearful of change, less pressure will be exerted on politicians to erect trade barriers or to take other actions that would reduce the flexibility and dynamism of the U.S.
economy."
Wage insurance could make up some of the difference between a lost job and a new one.
The insurance benefits would be low enough that people still had incentive to find new work, but high enough to soften the blow.

In the weeks leading to today's handover, some experts — including, quietly, some inside the Fed — have urged Mr. Bernanke to have smaller ambitions than Mr. Greenspan did.
Don't talk about big ideas, they say; stay focused on interest rates.
So I put the question to Mr. Mankiw, the last high-profile economist to get himself in trouble by talking about trade.
I began the conversation by pointing out the obvious, that selling people on trade is hard.
So should Mr. Bernanke stick to platitudes?
"Having a smart economist like Greenspan or Bernanke in a position where people will listen to him is too valuable," he said.
"Bernanke comes from a background of being a teacher and a textbook writer.
He may prove to be very good at boiling things down to their essence.
He may prove to be a fantastic communicator."

So speak up, Mr. Chairman.
Under current law, the interest rate on federal Stafford loans, taken out by students, will rise to 6.8 percent from 5.3 percent.
Republicans, Mr. Miller said in a statement yesterday, "obviously don't understand the kinds of sacrifices that families have to make so their children can go to college."
Both Democrats and Republicans have sought to characterize the bill as cutting expenses, although it is actually raising revenue, said Michael Dannenberg, director of education policy at the New America Foundation, a public policy institute in Washington.

"Republicans want to say that they're cutting the program because they want to say that they're cutting down the size of government," Mr. Dannenberg said.
Democrats want to say that Republicans are cutting the program "because it plays into the image that Republicans are anti-education," he added.
The increased rates and the windfall provision produce almost one-third of the overall savings in the budget bill.
But the changes have led some advocacy groups, which had hoped to have the windfall money somehow returned to students, to describe the new system as a hidden tax on student borrowers.

"This bill turns to students and families as the predominant source of revenue, rather than trying to identify inefficiencies in the loan programs," said Luke Swarthout, higher education associate for the State Public Interest Research Groups, a nonprofit consumer organization that opposed the law.
"This bill asks students and parents to pay for tax cuts."
Nearly 10 million students take out Stafford loans annually and about 800,000 parents take out PLUS loans, according to the Department of Education.
The law raises the maximum amount that students can borrow through the Stafford program, putting more costly educational opportunities within reach, but also deepening the potential hole students may find themselves in after graduation.
It also makes some existing types of loans available to graduate and professional students.

The fixed higher interest rates could prove to be good news for students and their families if market interest rates rise, provided that Congress does not raise the rate again in the future.

Jörg Krämer, the chief economist at the HVB Group in Munich, said, "The E.C.B.

The Fed has been raising rates regularly, "whatever the economic statistics," Mr. Krämer said.
"It would be very difficult to do that at the E.C.B., given the divisions on the board."
Those divisions bubbled to the surface on Thursday when Mr. Trichet pointedly reminded financial markets that he alone speaks for the bank's 18-member governing council on monetary policy.
He was referring to remarks made by an Italian member of the council, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, who has publicly expressed his reluctance to raise rates further in an economically fragile Europe.

The bank faces similar doubts on its economic analysis.

In Germany, investor confidence is soaring, yet retail sales continue to be weak and unemployment rose in January.
In France, manufacturing production slowed markedly in the most recent survey.

He considers the risks well worth it, because he can now reconstruct the evolutionary history of leeches -- how an ordinary worm hundreds of millions of years ago gave rise to sophisticated bloodsuckers that spread across the planet.

This was not a case of love at first sight.
"You couldn't exactly talk about it over Thanksgiving dinner."
Knowing that required knowing how leeches are related to one another, something that Dr. Siddall found was an open question.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In the late 1990's, scientists were developing methods that could shed light on the evolution of leeches like sequencing animal DNA and computer programs that could use the sequences to reconstruct evolutionary trees.

There was just one catch.
To collect leeches, Dr. Siddall and his colleagues take off their shoes, roll up their pants and wade into the water, even if its waist-high muck full of electric fish.
"You can't set traps for leeches," Dr. Siddall said.
"We are always the bait.
You can turn over rocks.
You can turn over branches.
But ultimately the interesting stuff is going to come to you."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Turning himself into bait is paying off.
Dr. Siddall's research has shown that the ancestors of leeches were probably freshwater worms that fed harmlessly on the surface of fish or crustaceans, as the closest living relatives of leeches do.
Not only do these worms have the most leechlike DNA of any animal, but they also grow the same sucker on the base of their tail that leeches use for crawling.

The leech evolutionary tree suggests that the earliest land vertebrates may have been the first hosts for leeches.
Dr. Siddall has identified several major innovations that early leeches evolved as they became blood feeders.
They acquired a proboscis they could push into their hosts to drink blood.
Leeches also needed chemicals that could keep their host's blood thin so that it would not clot in their bodies.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Leeches have evolved many different molecules for that work that interfere with different stages in clotting, along with other molecules that prevent inflammation.
Pharmaceutical companies have isolated some of these molecules and sell them as anticoagulants.
Blood is a good source of energy, but it does not make for a balanced diet.
Mosquitoes and other blood feeders have evolved a symbiosis with bacteria that can manufacture the vitamins and amino acids necessary for life.

Leeches appear to have evolved their own partnerships, even producing special chambers in their throats where bacteria can live.
It is particularly tough to study these bacteria, because scientists need to find leeches with big bacteria-housing organs to dissect.
It turns out that some of the biggest are in a species that lives just on the rear end of the hippopotamus.
So Dr. Siddall has traveled to South Africa in recent years to wade into crocodile-infested waters to look for them.

Terrestrial leeches became particularly adept at ambushing hosts, using their keen senses to detect carbon dioxide and heat.
They have 10 eyespots on their heads that they can use to detect moving objects.
"They've got incredible vision," Dr. Siddall said.
"You move your hand across their field of view, and they'll track the movement."

After the eggs hatch, the young leeches have to crawl to the water.
Dr. Siddall has been making a careful study of North American medicinal leeches in recent years, figuring out which genes do the best job of revealing the variations between different populations of leeches.
It turns out that some populations may actually represent entirely new species.
"We think we've found a new species in Harriman State Park here in New York," he said.

Although physicians no longer bleed their patients, Hirudo medicinalis has been enjoying a renaissance.
Surgeons reattaching fingers and ears find that patients heal faster with the help of leeches.
By sucking on blood and injecting anticoagulants, leeches increase the flow through the reconnected blood vessels.

In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration approved Hirudo medicinalis as a medical device, and a number of companies do a brisk business importing them from Europe to the United States.
Working with Peter Trontelj at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, Dr. Siddall began collecting the leeches from across Europe and ordered them from supply houses.
"The European medicinal leech is not one species at all," Dr. Siddall said.
"It's at least three."

Dr. Siddall and Dr. Trontelj are trying to determine the ranges of the three species and their differences.
He expects his discovery will lead to changes in F.D.A.
regulations.
More important, he hopes it will draw attention to the plight of European leeches.
Overharvesting and habitat destruction have cut their numbers drastically.
To understand the true condition of all three species, Dr. Siddall plans to go to Europe.
He will have to work the trip into a schedule filled with other expeditions.
"There are all sorts of things out there like Dinobdella ferox, which means the terrifying and ferocious leech," Dr. Siddall said.
"It lives in eastern Bengal, and it will literally crawl up your nose and lodge in the back of your throat."
Dr. Siddall knows that the notion of leech conservation may strike some people as an odd pursuit.
He points out how many medical surprises leeches have yielded.
New species will presumably yield new surprises.
But he also thinks people should be concerned about leeches simply because they are leeches.

Missing from the plan are the sweeping layoffs and deep cost reductions that Mr. Ghosn imposed to stem the losses at Nissan.
At a time when General Motors, Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler are cutting their payrolls, Mr. Ghosn said he did not foresee any job losses at Renault.

"Renault is not in crisis, but Renault is fragile," Mr. Ghosn said at a news conference in this suburb of Paris.
"What Renault needs today is not restructuring.
Renault needs growth."
The trick for Mr. Ghosn will be finding this growth in a European market that is stagnant, competitive and likely to become even more cutthroat as Toyota and other Japanese carmakers begin making the same inroads here that they made in the United States over the last decade.
In contrast to Nissan, where Mr. Ghosn was an outsider and could challenge Japanese conventions, he is an insider at Renault, working within the confines of French society.
Some analysts suspect that he avoided talk of layoffs for political reasons, with France entering an election season.

"It's a higher-risk plan," said Adam Jonas, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, comparing Mr. Ghosn's program for Renault with what he did at Nissan.
"It's missing some of the ingredients of a classic Ghosn turnaround.
There's no sense of crisis, no sense of urgency."

Urgency might be in order, Mr. Jonas said, given the deepening problems in Europe.
Sales of cars in Europe declined 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, and are not expected to rebound much this year.
Renault's unit sales in the region tumbled 7.3 percent in the second half of last year, contributing to a 37 percent decline in its 2005 operating profit.

Moreover, the Japanese are quickly developing the expertise in diesel engines that has been a competitive edge for the Europeans.
Mr. Jonas predicts that the major Japanese carmakers, plus Hyundai, will increase their share of the European market to more than 20 percent, from 17 percent, by the end of the decade.
Mr. Ghosn acknowledged Europe's poor prospects with a startling number -- of the 800,000 extra cars a year he plans to sell, 550,000 will be sold outside Europe, 250,000 within the Continent.
"We do not see the European market better in 2009 than it is today," he said, citing rising interest rates and energy prices as additional hurdles.
"Most of the growth will come from outside Europe."

While Dieter Zetsche of DaimlerChrysler and Wolfgang Bernhard of Volkswagen are relying heavily on cost reductions -- Mr. Zetsche has announced 14,500 job cuts at Mercedes-Benz -- Mr. Ghosn is betting that he can transform Renault into a more full-fledged competitor to the Germans.

Among his plans is a luxury line that would compete with Mercedes and BMW.
He pledged that Renault's new Laguna sedan, to be introduced in 2007, would rank in the top three in quality in its category.
Propelling a mass-market carmaker into the luxury segment is both costly and prone to failure.
"We are working to recover Renault's brand," he said.
Polishing the Renault name with stylish new cars, Mr. Ghosn said, should enable the company to achieve a profit margin of 6 percent by 2009, compared with slightly more than 3 percent last year.
That would put Renault at the same level of profitability as BMW and Toyota.

He also made a commitment to raise the annual dividend to 4.5 euros a share, compared with 1.8 euros a share in 2005.
But Mr. Ghosn played down the chances that Renault would buy a luxury brand, like Jaguar, to vault it into the market for higher-priced cars.

Renault's 44.3 percent stake in Nissan, however, is a clear source of strength.
Mr. Ghosn said the sharing of technology and parts between the companies would allow Renault to move faster in its overhaul.
The only downside for Mr. Ghosn is the inevitable comparison between his dramatic success at Nissan, and the murkier job he faces at Renault.
The comparison, he says, is flawed.
"I don't have a pattern of not meeting my objectives," he said.

That means the nation will go deeper into debt with the rest of the world as Americans continue to rely on the strong flow of foreign money, particularly from central banks in Asia, to finance the trade gap.
China, Japan and other foreign governments are some of the biggest holders of government securities, lending money to cover the substantial federal budget deficit and helping to keep interest rates and home mortgage costs here relatively low.
As a result, American consumers are able to spend more and save less.
Many economists say this situation is unsustainable over the long run, arguing that the United States could eventually face a harsh correction that would depress spending, increase the cost of borrowing and sharply lower the value of the dollar.
"There are certainly going to be inflows, the question is at what price?"
"As time goes on, it will become a little more difficult to attract foreign funds.
That's another way of saying the dollar will fall."

A stronger Chinese currency would make imports to the United States more expensive and American exports to that country cheaper.
Most analysts agree the yuan would rise significantly if it were set free, but many experts also worry that many financial institutions in China are not strong enough to survive the shocks that might accompany a fully convertible currency.
In the Senate, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, have proposed imposing a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese imports if the country does not allow its currency to appreciate further against the dollar.

Mr. Schumer said "there is a very strong likelihood that we will move our bill in March should the Chinese not show further movements."
"If you believe in free trade, you play by the rules," he said when asked if a protectionist tariff would hurt the American economy.
"The long-term damage of the Chinese pegging their currency far exceeds any immediate benefits and almost every economist would agree with that.
They might not agree with our methodology."

Experts note that a large portion of the deficit with China reflects its growing role as a hub for the assembly of goods as Asian manufacturers have shifted production there to save money.

While China draws most of the attention, perhaps the most important factor behind the swelling deficit last year was the rising cost of importing oil and other energy supplies.

After a fourth-quarter "speed bump," in which economic output increased at a 1.1 percent annual rate, investors have worried that growth is weakening, he said.
He does not share that concern, describing the economy as one of "sustainable growth, with many sectors operating at full strength."
Yet as evidence arrives confirming his view, he said, it may stir fear that the Federal Reserve, in Ben S. Bernanke's first weeks as chairman, is not nearly as inclined to stop raising interest rates as many people think.

The Bloomberg poll predicts a drop to 91, from 91.2 in January.
In 2005 spending on home construction as a percentage of G.D.P.
reached its highest level in more than 50 years.
People who already own houses are treating them like A.T.M.
's, converting home equity into spending money: last year the personal savings rate fell below zero for the first time since 1933.
And it's a sign of our degraded fiscal state that the Bush administration actually boasted about a 2005 budget deficit of more than $300 billion, because it was a bit lower than the 2004 deficit.

It all sounds unsustainable.
And it is.
Some people insist that the U.S. economy has hidden savings that official statistics fail to capture.
I won't go into the technical debate about these claims, some of which resemble arguments used not long ago to justify dot-com stock prices, except to say that the more closely one looks at the facts, the less plausible the "don't worry, be happy" hypothesis looks.
Denial takes a more systematic form within the federal government, where Dick Cheney is doing to budget analysis what he did to intelligence on Iraq.
Last week Mr. Cheney announced that a newly created division within the Treasury Department would show that tax cuts increase, not reduce, federal revenue.
That's the Bush-Cheney way: decide on your conclusions first, then demand that analysts produce evidence supporting those conclusions.

But serious analysts know that America's borrowing binge is unsustainable.
Sooner or later the trade deficit will have to come down, the housing boom will have to end, and both American consumers and the U.S. government will have to start living within their means.
So how bad will it be?
It depends on how the binge ends.
If it tapers off gradually, the U.S. economy will be able to shift workers out of sectors that have benefited from the housing boom and the consumption spree into sectors that produce exports or replace imports.
Given time, we could bring the trade deficit down and bring housing back to earth without a net loss in jobs.

In practice, however, a "soft landing" looks unlikely, because too many economic players have unrealistic expectations.
This is true of international investors, who are still snapping up U.S. bonds at low interest rates, seemingly oblivious both to the budget deficit and to the consensus view among trade experts that the dollar will eventually have to fall 30 percent or more to eliminate the trade deficit.

It's equally true of American home buyers.
Most Americans live in regions where housing remains affordable.
But a detailed new study by HSBC, a multinational bank, confirms what I and others have been saying: most of the rise in housing values has taken place in a "bubble zone" along the coasts, where housing prices have risen far more than the economic fundamentals warrant.
According to HSBC's estimates, houses in the bubble zone are overvalued by between 35 and 40 percent, creating trillions of dollars of illusory wealth.
So it seems all too likely that America's borrowing binge will end with a bang, not a whimper, that spending will suddenly drop off as both the bond market and the housing market experience rude awakenings.
If that happens, the economic consequences will be ugly.

All in all, Alan Greenspan, who helped create this situation, can consider himself lucky that he's safely out of office, giving briefings to hedge fund managers at $250,000 a pop.
And his successor may be in for a rough ride.
Best wishes and good luck, Ben; you may need it.
Here is a link to the Economic Report to the President.
There is a section there on the national real estate market.
It’s a very measured report, talking about the rent-to-price ratio without pointing out what it means.
Just as nearly every pilot adopted Chuck Yeager’s drawl, has every economist in Washington adopted Greenspanspeak?
The report offers this forecast as well:
“During the next five years, the Administration expects the pace of homebuilding to decrease gradually because of demographic trends and slowly rising long-term interest rates.
A gradual slowing of homebuilding appears more likely than a sharp drop because the elevated level of house prices will sustain homebuilding as a profitable enterprise for some time.
On balance, residential investment is not projected to contribute to real GDP growth during the four quarters of 2006; in subsequent years, it is expected to subtract a bit from overall growth.
— DAMON DARLIN
The new chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, delivers his first report to Congress today, covering interest rate policy and the Fed's economic forecast for this year and next.
It's a big moment for Mr. Bernanke, and perhaps for the economy.
The new chairman's success at establishing his Street cred will be a big factor in controlling that most unpredictable of economic forces: market psychology.
His predecessor, Alan Greenspan, could help by playing the circumspect banker a while longer.
Last week, days after becoming a private citizen, Mr. Greenspan talked privately to an audience at Lehman Brothers, the world's biggest bond-trading outfit.
The extent to which Mr. Greenspan's remarks moved the markets is debatable.
We also don't know how accurate the leaks were.
(It does seem unlikely that Mr. Greenspan has suddenly taken to speaking with crystal certainty, as suggested by the traders' interpretation of what he is supposed to have said.)
What's not arguable is that any transition at the Fed is tricky, and that this one is particularly fraught.
What will happen to consumption -- and economic growth -- when the housing boom subsides?
Would the new chairman even be able to do that, given that higher rates help to attract the foreign capital to cover America's deficits?
How would more rate increases affect deeply indebted households?
Mr. Greenspan's devotion to the strength and integrity of the Federal Reserve is beyond doubt; the institution's solidity owes much to his leadership.
But the public and the markets need to have confidence in the new chief, and that is best built by hearing from Mr. Bernanke without what is likely to be interpreted as cues from the wings or, worse, cross talk.
It has been more than 18 years since anybody other than Mr. Greenspan occupied the bully pulpit of Fed chairman, and there may never be anyone else in the position whose every utterance is parsed so painstakingly by so many people.

But Mr. Bernanke, a former professor at Princeton whose name is still unfamiliar to some members of Congress, barely broke a sweat in three hours of nonstop testimony that was broadcast live on C-Span and scrutinized by analysts around the world.
"I give him an A-plus," said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, a forecasting firm in New York City.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And he refused to echo Mr. Greenspan's longstanding plea that Congress reinstate budget rules requiring that it pay for both new tax cuts and new spending with savings in other parts of the budget.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That was the one point on which Mr. Greenspan consistently disagreed with Mr. Bush, who has opposed any such restriction on tax cuts.
"I don't feel it's appropriate for me to make recommendations to Congress about their procedures," Mr. Bernanke said.
For the most part, Mr. Bernanke was soothing about the risks ahead.
In particular, he played down worries about the United States' record trade deficit, its growing foreign indebtedness and the possibility of a plunge in the housing market.

The central bank's current forecast, he said, calls for the economy to expand at a fairly strong pace of 3.5 percent in 2006, the fifth year of above-average growth, and unemployment to remain at 5 percent or below.

Core inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, is expected to be 2 percent in 2006 -- just at the upper end of the Fed's unofficial comfort zone.
"I am comfortable with these projections," Mr. Bernanke said, carefully warning lawmakers and investors not to assume that the Fed has finished raising its benchmark interest rate, currently at 4.5 percent.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The central bank will have to make "ongoing provisional judgments" about the risks to inflation and growth, he said, and decisions will be "increasingly dependent on incoming data."

By contrast, Mr. Bernanke delivered essentially the same message this way: "Some cooling of the housing market is to be expected and would not be inconsistent with continued solid growth."
He fielded questions about the trade deficit, inequality in wages, terrorism risk insurance and reforming the government-sponsored mortgage finance companies.

"No one talks like him, and we don't want you to," said Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California.

But within an hour of answering his first question, Mr. Bernanke had offered opinions on contentious legislative proposals that have little direct connection to monetary policy.

He strongly endorsed efforts by President Bush and Republican leaders to speed up the construction of big new terminals for importing liquefied natural gas.
Supporters of such terminals say they would lower natural gas prices in the United States, which are much higher than prices elsewhere in the world.
But political leaders in many port cities oppose such terminals, fearing that they could lead to deadly explosions.

Similarly, Mr. Bernanke also supported legislation to reduce government guarantees for terrorism risk insurance, arguing that private insurers should assume more of the financial responsibility.
And when asked about legislation to increase the number of scientists and engineers, he suggested that the government focus on giving students tuition vouchers and letting them choose where to spend them.

"If the tax relief expires, which would amount to basically a tax increase at that point, what if any impact do you think that would have on the economy and jobs and growth?"
asked Representative Paul Gillmor, Republican of Ohio.

Mr. Bernanke responded that "most economists would agree that the tax relief earlier this decade was helpful in helping the economy recover from the recession in 2001."
"You're forgiven," Mr. Gillmor said.
"It is a time-tested pattern," said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, noting that builders may have started work on homes that they sold ahead of construction at the end of last year.
"February has essentially returned to normal conditions, suggesting to me that we will see a substantial decline in housing starts."

The effect of the weather could further be magnified because most economic data, including housing starts, is adjusted to account for seasonal weather and other patterns.
Because January is usually one of the coldest months of the year, those adjustments would have bolstered the data that the Commerce Department reports for the month even if construction were flat.
Before adjusting for seasonal factors, housing starts were up 11.3 percent from December.

Housing start data is also subject to a significant margin of error, plus or minus 9.9 percentage points in January, because it is based on a relatively small sampling of data.

But even as they acknowledge the slowdown, many housing industry officials are generally optimistic about the year to come, given that mortgage interest rates remain low and that the economy has been adding jobs at a stronger clip in recent months.
The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.15 percent in January, up from 5.71 percent a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac, but that is still low by historical standards.

But taking a hard look at itself is crucial to repairing a company that lies at the heart of the American housing market, Mr. Mudd maintained.

On top of the Rudman report, a flurry of federal regulators -- including the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight -- are continuing to look under Fannie's hood.
They are examining how executives violated accounting rules to smooth its earnings, leading Fannie Mae's board to force out Mr. Raines and most of his senior management team beginning in December 2004.

About 2,000 outside accountants and consultants have swarmed through its offices, taking over parts of the cafeteria and Mr. Raines's former wood-paneled office, to help clean up the accounting mess.

On Wall Street, where the company's share price and dividend have been almost halved, investors are hearing from Fannie more often but can glean few details.
Until the company completes its accounting restatement -- a job that analysts suggest will take at least another year -- it is limited in what it can say.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
At the same time, Fannie is not quite the mortgage behemoth it once was.
Today, the market is flooded with more nontraditional mortgages, like interest-only and ARM loans, that the company largely eschewed.
And Fannie is now facing intense competition from companies like Countrywide Financial, Lehman Brothers and Wells Fargo, which have become huge packagers of mortgages in the secondary market.
More ominously, legislation that threatens the very core of its business looms in Congress.
Among the options the Senate is considering are creating a new, stronger regulator and imposing sharp limits on the size of its highly profitable portfolio.
For all the discussion of a humbler, gentler Fannie Mae, critics say little has changed.
"All the talk of the new Fannie Mae -- we are warm and fuzzy now, everybody loves us -- means nothing unless you put the proper oversight structure in place," said Mike House, executive director of FM Policy Focus, a lobbyist group backed by the company's mortgage industry rivals.

Created by Congress during the Great Depression, Fannie Mae and its smaller sibling, Freddie Mac, have become twin titans of the American housing market.
Instead of lending directly to consumers, they buy bundles of mortgages and then either resell them as securities or hold them in their portfolios.

Supporters argue that this greater liquidity has helped lower housing costs and keep interest rates low, and the perceived stability has allowed homebuyers to lock in rates for as long as 30 years.
But critics say that Fannie Mae's status as a quasi-public enterprise has simply subsidized rich investors instead of homebuyers and led to a heavy-handed approach in dealing with critics and regulators.
Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate banking committee, has advanced legislation that he expects to bring to the floor this year to impose a tougher regulatory regime and curtail the company's portfolio.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The legislation sponsored by Mr. Shelby goes further, but in the process has alienated many Democrats, who say that reining in Fannie could result in higher housing costs for those in lower income levels.

Since becoming Fannie's chief executive a little more than a year ago, Mr. Mudd, 47, has been on a mission to reshape the company's culture and distance himself from its previous management team.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The new tone of outreach and humility acknowledges that Fannie's old insular and arrogant stance was not working.
Yet, it also reflects the leadership style of Mr. Mudd, a confident but approachable former Marine captain who is a son of Roger Mudd, the former TV newsman.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
On Capitol Hill, Mr. Mudd has tried hard to repair relationships with Fannie Mae's main regulators, lawmakers and critics.
He has made contrition a central theme.
Last fall, he invited Richard H. Baker, a longtime critic who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees Fannie Mae, to address the company's advisory council.
In a speech before the National Association of Home Builders last month, Mr. Mudd referenced the old parable: pride goes before the fall.
"They are now a partner where you can conduct conversation and dialogue."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Mudd has also ratcheted down Fannie's well-oiled lobbying machine.
The company cut its external lobbying 24 percent in 2005, to $3.7 million, by letting go about six out of several dozen lobbying firms and eliminating advocacy spots on television.
But tactically, Fannie seems to have simply lowered the volume of its approach instead of scaling it back.
"Plus, they had the homebuilders and Realtors lobby for them."
With three groups of federal investigators routinely banging on its doors, Fannie may have little choice but to keep a lower profile.
At the same time, profits from its core business of buying and holding mortgages are under pressure.

Shortly after its chief regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, required Fannie to increase substantially its capital reserves because of the accounting troubles, the company began selling off parts of its portfolio.
It shrank by about 20 percent by the end of 2005.
Only in the last few months has Fannie again become a buyer.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Although Mr. Mudd expects to continue increasing the portfolio, Fannie no longer wields the buying clout it had just a few years ago.
"The markets are getting more competitive and the protection afforded by their implicit subsidy is getting eroded," said Dwight M. Jaffee, a professor of real estate finance at the University of California, Berkeley.
And hedging against home price inflation and interest rate risk could eat into profits even more.

The accounting issues, meanwhile, have done little to help.
"Fannie is so involved in the massive accounting restatement that they don't have time to focus on new products, marketing to new customers, or just building the businesses," added Guy Cecala, the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.
Mr. Mudd plans to change that, too.
Even as its critics try to limit Fannie's activities, the company is trying to grow its nascent business of financing apartment projects.
He also has plans to enter the construction lending business and subprime mortgage market, among others to be announced this summer.

But with release of the Rudman report next week, there may be another crisis to manage.
"I have," Mr. Mudd said.
"I obviously would have liked to have gotten the job under a different set of circumstances."
"I hope things work out positively for Frank," he added.
Correction: February 23, 2006, Thursday Labels on a chart in Business Day on Saturday showing market share in secondary mortgages were reversed.
THE Greenspan Federal Reserve did the heavy lifting, never missing a chance in its last 14 interest-rate-setting meetings to execute a quarter-point upward nudge.
Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, says he expects a core consumer inflation rate of 0.2 percent for January.
That would be the same figure as in the preceding three months and the number forecast in a Bloomberg News poll of economists.
The government report is to be released Wednesday.
The core Consumer Price Index excludes the volatile components of food and energy.
When those are tossed back into the mix, the Bloomberg poll sees a gain of 0.5 percent.
The C.P.I.
component that Mr. Yardeni will examine especially closely covers rent and comprises about one-fourth of the basket of goods and services tracked in the report.
Rent is important, he said, because of its close association with wages.

Yet SageCrest is not the only hedge fund in this business.
So why are hedge funds -- supposedly the sophisticated money, making bold, broad bets -- rushing into lending?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Part of the answer is that while interest rates are low, hedge funds are able to lend money at sky-high rates.
SageCrest, for example, charges LawCash 16 percent annually for what it borrows.
But the trend also reflects the fact that as some 8,000 hedge funds look for ways to put their billions of dollars to work, they are pushing further into uncharted territories in search of high returns.
"Hedge funds seem to be sticking their nose into just about everything these days," said Charles M. Roame, managing principal of Tiburon Strategic Advisors, a San Francisco management consultant to financial services companies.
"They're in every crazy asset class you can think of" including bottles of wine, paintings and coin collections, he said.
"The esoteric-ness of the alternative investments just keeps getting more and more esoteric."
Lending, an old and seemingly ho-hum business, is now one of the hottest new investments for hedge funds.
The funds are making investments in consumer credit card debt and specialty finance companies, and are going head-to-head with banks to provide loans to small companies and even individuals.

"We have seen phenomenal growth in the last couple of years in hedge funds expanding their horizons to the credit space," said Chad Leat, head of global credit markets at Citigroup.

Besides hoping for a big payoff in these types of loans, hedge funds are also seeking returns that are not related to movements in the stock or even bond markets.

"In the past several years, the hedge fund industry has undergone dynamic changes where managers are seeking to utilize strategies which do not correlate to traditional market gyrations," said Ron Geffner, a lawyer at the New York law firm of Sadis & Goldberg.
Besides trading weather derivatives and complex life insurance products, some of Mr. Geffner's clients are preparing to start hedge funds that will invest in class-action lawsuits and precious coins.
The greatest activity by hedge funds has been in the credit business.
And in October, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Farallon Capital Management, two hedge funds known for unusual investing, lent $64 million to Pay By Touch, a San Francisco-based company that sells devices to make payments using a fingerprint.

Market participants say the entry of hedge funds has increased the availability of money in the market.
As a result, small and midsize companies may have greater access to loans at a time when most big banks have abandoned that market.

It is unclear how long this will last.
While some hedge funds have long-time horizons for their investments, the majority are known for moving rapidly in and out of sectors as they seek the next great investment idea.
And hedge fund investors have the ability to redeem their investments, which could force a hedge fund to exit a business sooner than it would necessarily like to raise money.
The more important issue for hedge funds as they venture further out on the risk scale is what types of loans and investments are appropriate.
In one case, Citadel and Wells Fargo Foothill got into a legal tangle after making a $60 million loan in 2000 to Jack Abramoff, the lobbyist who has since been indicted, to help him buy SunCruz, a company that operated floating casinos in Florida.

Interest rate policy is made at periodic meetings in Washington.
The Fed's seven governors have permanent seats on the policy-making committee.
Five of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks rotate the right to vote every few meetings.

Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Bernanke have differed mildly on inflation policy and there was speculation among Fed watchers -- none of it on the record -- that their differences might have contributed to Mr. Ferguson's resignation.
The vice chairman opposed publicly targeting an inflation rate of, say, 2 percent, a procedure that Mr. Bernanke has strongly favored.

Mr. Bernanke, however, has softened his approach.
Rather than insist on setting a target, he has moved closer to the more informal practice of Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Ferguson.
Already, Mr. Berner said, "the Fed has clearly moved in the direction of de facto inflation targeting."
The findings come as Fannie Mae's regulator considers whether to force some former executives to return bonuses.
And the report will not be the final word on the scandal: the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are still investigating former executives.

Fannie Mae was run with "an attitude of arrogance," according to the report, which catalogs how the company violated accounting principles repeatedly to show stable earnings and less volatility.
But the most troubling finding was that the company, rattled by falling interest rates in 1998, improperly delayed taking nearly $200 million in expenses.
That move and other, smaller accounting steps let it meet earnings goals, enabling executives -- including Franklin D. Raines, then the chief executive-designate, and James A. Johnson, the chief executive -- to receive the maximum amount in bonuses for that year.

The report comes as Fannie Mae continues to struggle through the accounting scandal.
The company has not filed an earnings statement since 2004.
Later this year, it is expected to make a $11 billion restatement of its earnings going back to 2001.
The company's main regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, is preparing a report to be issued in the next few months.
And Congress, with the urging of the Bush administration, has been preparing legislation that could restrict Fannie Mae and set up a more aggressive oversight agency.

Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, said the report "describes a corporate culture at Fannie Mae that put earnings ahead of any other consideration."
Mr. Shelby's legislation would set up a more aggressive regulatory regime and sharply limit Fannie Mae's business.
It was approved on a party line vote by the Banking Committee last July and has run into resistance from Democrats and industry allies of Fannie Mae.

Fannie Mae and its smaller sibling, Freddie Mac, hold a combined portfolio of about $1.5 trillion.
"We may now have better accounting practices at the institution," Mr. Quarles said.
"But that doesn't reduce the risk associated with size of their portfolios."

Fannie Mae provides hundreds of billions of dollars to the home finance market yearly by buying mortgages from banks and savings associations.
It keeps some mortgages in its portfolio.
Others are repackaged and sold as mortgage-backed securities.

That decline prompted many homeowners to prepay then refinance mortgages, leading to an estimated new expense of about $440 million for Fannie Mae.
Company officials decided, however, to take only a $240 million expense and defer the remaining $200 million, in violation of an accounting rule.
"For 1998, I'm reasonably confident there's enough in the 'non-recurring earnings piggy bank' to get us to $3.21," Mr. Small wrote.
"While that number should satisfy investors, you should be aware that last year the A.I.P.
paid out just short of the maximum.
This year, the maximum is $3.23, so at $3.21, the bonus pool will be noticeably lower than in 1997, a fact which will, of course, be rapidly observed by officers and directors come January."

Perhaps so, but year over year, the core rate has been lower than the overall gain in the C.P.I.
for 39 consecutive months.
That is the longest such stretch since the government started computing the core rate in the 1950's.
Energy prices have been volatile, but the expected return to lower levels is not happening.

Another reason the inflation view from Main Street is less rosy than the one on Wall Street is the way a third necessity -- housing -- is measured in the index.
The government estimates what rents would be on homes occupied by owners, and ignores sale prices.
The 4.3 percent rise in housing costs over the last 12 months is higher than the rent increase of just 2.5 percent, largely because the cost of heating homes is up.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That is not the way the government used to do it.
Greg Jensen of Bridgewater Associates, a money management firm, estimates that if the C.P.I.
housing component were still computed the old way, both the core and the overall rate would be about 2 percentage points higher.
How does 6 percent inflation sound?
Even the old method did not fully pick up the rising value of homes.
The government's best house-price index, from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, will be out next week for the fourth quarter.
Since the end of 1995, that index shows that home prices have doubled, while the C.P.I.
shows housing costs are up by a third.
Rising home prices have made consumers feel more wealthy and given them more money to spend as mortgages are refinanced.
But Wall Street looks at a Consumer Price Index that pays little attention to such rises, and says inflation is low.
It is fun while it lasts.

He did not like to dwell on the past, much less advertise it.
To avoid alarming eavesdroppers, he referred to his former compatriots as "the Tangoes."
But sometimes the past had a way of finding him.
Four years earlier.
March 2001.
Twenty-two years old and a member of the Taliban -- at that moment, in fact, the very face and voice of the regime in America.

They'd say things like, 'The Russians have a missile that can hit the White House,' and I'd say, 'The Americans have a missile that can hit a dot on the back of a cow standing in the Kremlin!"'

"Why didn't your older brothers help out?"
"That's a good question," Rahmatullah said.
I thought I would never see school again.
We were in a constant economic crisis, moving from one house to another."
To guard the stock against thieves during the night, his younger brother, Asadullah, would lock Rahmatullah inside behind a steel shutter.
He read the Persian poets Sa'di Shirazi and Rumi by candlelight, and the Pashtun Shakespeare, Rahman Baba: "An ignorant man is like a corpse."
"Who is it?"
he shouted, grabbing his father's knife.

In 1992, Rahmatullah's father sold the shoe shop to take a job working for a United Nations demining program in Afghanistan.
Learning English was considered as valuable as a high-school degree anyway.
From 1992 until 1995, internecine fighting killed more than 40,000 people in Kabul alone.
In the fall of 1994, a group of mullahs and madrassa students emerged in the Kandahar region as yet another of the seemingly numberless factions vying for control of Afghanistan.
To one young Afghan exile, following the news from Quetta on BBC radio broadcasts, the Taliban looked like the saviors of his homeland; like thousands of other Afghan refugees hungry for a future in their own country, he was eager to be one of them.
I said to my father, 'I really want to join them."'

The Taliban might still be in power today but for the hospitality they extended to Osama bin Laden.
I heard about him again when I was taking notes during a meeting, I think it was in 1997, with the U.S. chargé d'affairs in Kandahar.
The first was stopping the fighting with the Northern Alliance.
I had to have one of the Americans repeat the name for me."

Rahmatullah heard bin Laden speak at a house in Kandahar in 1998, not long after Qaeda agents financed by bin Laden blew up two U.S. embassies, in Kenya and Tanzania, and President Clinton retaliated by launching 75 cruise missiles at what were thought to be four terrorist training camps near the eastern Afghanistan town of Khost.
The job of translating the indictment into Pashto fell to Rahmatullah.
'Confederated.'
'Vanguard.'
'Heretics."'
Another factor may have been the possibility that the deaths of 224 people in far-off American embassies wouldn't seem all that notable in a country in which 40,000 people had already been killed in the rocket-riddled capital, and where war was still raging in the north and you could die if you stepped in the wrong place.
Afghanistan was then, and remains today, one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.
It is also one of the poorest, and has one of the lowest rates of life expectancy.
The average Afghan is dead at 43.
Truth be told, Rahmatullah was beginning to wonder about some aspects of life with the Taliban.
The international image of the Taliban was increasingly dominated by the Vice and Virtue busybodies who were checking the lengths of beards and thrashing women with leather straps and herding crowds into the Kabul soccer stadium to witness lashings amputations and executions.
Before long he found himself wrapping on turbans of a less controversial color.
Needing to urinate, he pulled the car to the side of the highway.
"Oh, man, I'm really tired, I just want to go home," Rahmatullah said.
Outside I could see a giant Hiroshima-like mushroom cloud."
The explosion, believed to be the work of Iranian-backed agents, killed 40 people, including two of Mullah Omar's stepbrothers.
"There were limbs all over the place, hanging from trees.
If we had driven over there, you wouldn't even have found pieces of us."
Once in Germany, he saw the extremes to which Western companies will go to boost sales.
He and another diplomat craned for a glimpse.
"Who is Pierre Cardin?"
The Camel: May 2000 to October 2001
Midday on May 21, 2000, Rahmatullah was holding a sign at the airport in Quetta, Pakistan: "Mr. Mick Hoober."
Close enough.

Rahmatullah had a driver, and Hoover was traveling with another filmmaker, Cindy Carpenter Spies, who was working on a documentary about Afghan women.
"I thought, They're probably going to kill us right here."
One night, a week or so into the trip, Hoover was sitting on the floor of the foreign office guest house in Kandahar, drinking tea as Rahmatullah and some other Taliban peeled potatoes and onions.
"Do you believe people are related to dogs?"
Dogs are not favored in Afghan society; the question dared him to contradict common sense.

"Yes," Hoover said.
The Taliban all laughed in amazement.
"How can you possibly believe that?
We are so different."
"You see only differences.
I see similarities."
"Similarities!
Like what?"

"Bilateral symmetry," he said.
"What does that mean?"
"It means dogs have eyes on either side of their nose, just like humans.
Dogs have two nostrils, just like humans.
They have two lungs.
They have toenails.
They have a heart in the center of their chest.
Dog blood and human blood are indistinguishable."
They were starting to get uneasy.
It was scraggly and covered with sores; I think the appropriate word for it would be 'cur.'
After a long time they came to the conclusion that it would."
He was a diplomat, an envoy, a spokesman hoping to translate the conditions of his country into terms Americans could understand.

The trip had been Hoover's idea.
He put up a lot of the money for the travel expenses and called people who could help arrange places for Rahmatullah to sleep and set up speaking gigs and interviews.
"The way to break down cultural barriers is exchange," Hoover says.
"The reason Rahmatullah was called a 'roving ambassador' is because nobody would have him.
Why not let him talk, let him explain, let him have his say?"
The idea that he could help improve the Taliban's public image was probably doomed from the start.

Five years later, his U.S.C.
talk seems both shrewd and naïve -- in some places well informed and rhetorically effective; in others disingenuous or just plain ignorant.
If "the world is destroying our future with economic sanctions," Rahmatullah said, "then they have no right to worry about our past."
Citing the Taliban revocation of ancient tribal practices like honor killing, exchanging women as gifts and arranging marriages without a bride's permission, he insisted that the Taliban had actually enhanced the lot of women by giving them the right of "self-determination."
Was that not terrorism?
If part of being a good Muslim means always telling the truth, as he was raised to believe, he was learning how hard it is to be virtuous and a government spokesman at the same time.

"On the East Coast the questions were much harder, especially about bin Laden and the Buddhist statues," he recalls.
"You have imprisoned the women -- it's a horror, let me tell you," she cried.
Rahmatullah was caught on videotape responding: "I'm really sorry to your husband.
He might have a very difficult time with you."
Looking back, sitting in the Commons after his class on terrorism, he said that were he to do the trip over, he would be less antagonistic.
"I regret the way I spoke sometimes.

The most substantive debate took place at Yale on March 27, 2001.
"He said, 'Women under the Taliban cannot go to doctors,' and I said, 'Do you think I cannot take my daughter to a doctor?'

At one point, Rahmatullah asked, "Have you ever been to Afghanistan?"
"Well, if you were my only source of information about the Taliban, I'd hate them too!"
But it might have been wise to recall the words of Rahman Baba: "An ignorant man is like a corpse."
What Koh may have lacked in personal experience of Afghanistan he had offset with time in the library.
He had just finished serving more than two years in the Clinton administration as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor.
"I remember three moments," he says.
He said, 'It's not that we refuse to let the girls study in school, it's that we haven't prepared the materials yet.'
Harold replied, 'What you're hearing this afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, is the sound of a diplomat hung out to dry.'

On the flight home, Rahmatullah was optimistic that relations with the United States could be improved and that the United Nations sanctions that were punishing the people of Afghanistan could be lifted.

I said: 'There isn't any time.

That spring and summer of 2001, from a Western perspective at least, Mullah Omar and the hard-line Taliban seemed driven by a perverse desire to pile folly upon folly.

Rahmatullah thought that if he could live his life over, he would steer clear of politics.

Rahmatullah had been nervous about getting an adversarial debriefer.
Somebody could put whatever he felt like in his file, and he would be on a transport to Guantánamo Bay with his head in a sack.
She asked if he knew of anyone who would pose a threat to Muttawakil, who as a moderate ex-Taliban might be in the cross hairs of extremists on both sides.
Rahmatullah had no idea how much time or how many interviews it would take to "clear" his name.
He passed the hours in limbo reading the Hadith, the sayings of the prophet Muhammad, and playing "chinny chockers" with Muttawakil.

The Karzai administration invited Rahmatullah to work for the government, but with the Northern Alliance now controlling the Afghan military, he feared for his safety in Kabul.

Schuster called the provost's office to ask how an ex-Taliban envoy with a fourth-grade education and a high-school equivalency degree might go about applying to one of the world's top universities.
Rahmatullah should send a short bio to Richard Shaw, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale.
Not knowing how long he would have to wait for the Yale interview, he had arranged to stay with an Afghan family on Long Island.

The letter came in January 2005.
He was in, admitted to Yale as a nondegree student, with the understanding that if he did well after a summer term and two regular freshman terms; if he could get the grades, improve his math, refine his writing, prepare for the science; if he could figure out how to pay for tuition, room, board and books; if he could endure the cultural dislocation, the difficulty of visa restrictions, the plaintive voice of his wife on the far side of the world, his little boy, Suleman, telling him to slip out of class when the teacher wasn't looking and come home; well, then he would be welcome to apply for regular degree status in the spring of 2006.

Pashtun friendships are often characterized by a certain brusqueness.

"Some of what I am studying at Yale in theory I think I have already learned in practice.
Theory is always distant.
Theory and experience hardly ever meet.

Many distinctions could be drawn between his old life and his life at Yale.
"You have to be reasonable to live in America," he said.

A few weeks after our visit, aching for his family, Rahmatullah hit a low point.
The semester was ending.
Everyone was heading home to see his family but him.
He could not leave the country on his visa with any assurance of its being renewed in time for class.
The future, his vague hopes of returning to Afghanistan to work in education, seemed remote.
He said to Ahmed one day, "What is the meaning of life?"

Investors once hung onto every word — even the abstruse ones — uttered by Alan Greenspan.
It’s not entirely obvious that readers will want to do likewise, based on a copy of the book proposal that Mr. Greenspan, who a month ago stepped down as chairman of the Federal Reserve after 18 years, is currently shopping to publishers.
In the 10-page document, a copy of which was obtained by DealBook, Mr. Greenspan says he will use his book to “outline what I have learned over the past 30 years, how I learned it and how it has helped policy makers like me anticipate the future.”
Still, there is clearly a ready audience for Mr. Greenspan’s prose.
He has of late been busy on the lecture circuit, earning $250,000 for a speech last month at Lehman Brothers, for example.
(That’s $150,000 above his regular $100,000 speaking fee.)
Mr. Greenspan’s treatment starts with an anecdote describing the moment he learned of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, while flying from Zurich to Washington.
The document moves on to discuss economic issues like protectionism (he is against it), the “conundrum” of long-term interest rates (he says he will explain it) and China’s future role in the global economy (he thinks it’s big).
The proposal drops a lot of names, though mostly foreign ones – Boris Yeltsin, Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Chirac – and it dances around the question of whether or not Mr. Greenspan will get personal.
“I do not intend to dwell on personality aberrations, except as they affect policy decision-making – which, of course, always involves personalities.”
More excerpts from Mr. Greenspan’s proposal:
On September 11
In the weeks and months following 9/11, I struggled to find some sense of certainty in a world in which senseless violence threatened to revisit at any moment.
Widespread fear usually induces consumers and businesses to disengage from economic exchange, sharply contracting economic activity.
But to my surprise that didn’t happen.
It is at such moments, when developments challenge my previous understanding of the way the economy works, that I gain new insights.
On Presidents and being a ‘prop’
With the exception of President Carter, I have known and worked with — or for — every resident of the White House since 1969.
Some I have known exceptionally well; others less so.
I will offer my impressions and comparisons along with evaluations of cabinet secretaries, ambassadors, members of Congress and lesser, but important, policymakers.
I do not intend to dwell on personality aberrations, except as they affect policy decision-making — which, of course, always involves personalities.
I will also describe what it’s like to be a prop at a congressional hearing, which is too often the role of witnesses.
On political parties
The eventual dominance of Republicans in southern national politics brought the two major parties to numerical equality but, in the process, induced an ideological divide between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, leaving a vast untended center from which a well-financed independent Presidential candidate is likely to emerge in 2008 or, if not then, in 2012.
On China
The book will ultimately conclude that the longer-term outlook for the global economy and, for that matter the U.S. economy as well, will be significantly affected by the future of China.
And China’s future, in turn, will depend to a large degree on the internal struggle within China between the liberal technocrats, who seek a market-based China, and those whose primary concern is political control.
[…] I believe the liberals are currently winning and will ultimately prevail, for reasons I’ll spell out.

By giving little hint of the timing of the next increase, Mr. Trichet has left the bank's 18-member governing council a degree of flexibility.

The euro rose against the dollar Thursday, settling at $1.2033 in New York, up from $1.1915 late Tuesday, as currency markets reflected the likelihood of tighter monetary policy.
Economists generally expect the bank to act again in June, and nothing Mr. Trichet said threw that into doubt.
"They believe that rates are very low and need to be higher."
With the bank's decision so widely expected, much of the attention on Thursday focused on whether Mr. Trichet would wade into the debate in Europe over the resurgence of protectionism and nationalism in France and Spain, in the wake of several cross-border takeover attempts.

"There is a serious problem" with growth, Mr. Urso said in a statement, "and hiking the cost of money takes oxygen from the recovery."
Yet others noted that the bank's forecasts would suggest a bolder upward move on rates.
Its revised projections, for example, foresee inflation running solidly above 2 percent this year and in 2007.
The bank's cardinal goal is to keep inflation at or below the 2 percent threshold.
"The way the data are shaping up, they might consider slightly speeding up the pace of tightening," said Elga Bartsch, an economist at Morgan Stanley.

Those fears have largely dissipated.
Economists now say that corporate optimism was not a fluke.
"As long as the data point to an ongoing economic recovery, they should feel comfortable about normalizing rates," Ms. Bartsch said.
"If anything, the survey numbers are more robust than before."
Economists hold different views of what constitutes a normal level for short-term interest rates, but it tends to be in the range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent.
That would imply at least one further increase this year, and more likely two.
"It's a sign that Japan's economy is finally returning to relative normalcy," said Naoki Iizuka, an economist at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance in Tokyo.

But as Japan's economic troubles have lifted, the policy has had the unintended effect of turning the nation into a cash spigot for the rest of the world.
Low interest rates have prompted Japanese investors to go overseas in search of higher returns, pouring funds into American and other markets.
If interest rates rise in Japan, as they have begun to do already in anticipation of a tightening by the central bank, that flow of money could stop or even reverse.
This could prompt sell-offs in world financial markets, and possibly even raise borrowing costs for American consumers.
"Many believe that the Bank of Japan has been providing liquidity to global markets," said Stefan Worrall, an economist in Tokyo for Credit Suisse First Boston.
"The risk is that a return to normal interest rate policy and an eventual tightening may lead to a tightening" of this money flow.

The Bank of Japan has tried to ease these fears by saying it wants to keep interest rates near zero even as it eases out of the current policy by reducing the amount of free cash available to banks.
But the Bank of Japan may eventually have to raise interest rates to head off a return of inflation as Japan's $4.6 trillion economy roars back to life.

A rising number of economists and policy makers say that the country is now on stronger economic footing.
A REPORT published today by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group, confirms that meat and the milk from cows fed only grass have higher levels of omega-3's, beneficial fatty acids, than meat and milk from cows raised conventionally, on grain.
Omega-3's may prevent heart disease and bolster the immune system.
There is little argument that grass-fed steaks and ground beef are almost always lower in fat than those from cattle raised conventionally.
But according to the author of the report, Kate Clancy, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, steak from grass-fed cattle also has higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than steak from cattle raised conventionally.
Milk from grass-fed cows also tends to have higher levels of one of the omega-3's.
But for C.L.A., another omega fatty acid, Dr. Clancy said, human studies do not exist.
There are more than 750,000 Web sites promoting the benefits of C.L.A., including its ability to reduce the risk of breast cancer, decrease body fat and enhance the immune system.

"C.L.A.
is a very interesting phenomenon as a fatty acid and the animal findings are unbelievable," Dr. Clancy said on Monday.
"But the research on the human side has not caught up."

Her study pointed out that consumers have lower exposure to antibiotics when they eat grass-fed animals.
Conventionally raised animals are routinely given antibiotics to promote growth and prevent disease while those that are grass-fed receive only therapeutic doses.
The report also discusses environmental benefits from raising animals on grass instead of on grain requiring fertilizers and pesticides: less soil erosion and improved water quality.
And there are economic advantages: more profit per animal for producers.

The world has been awaiting the decision because the tightening by the bank will end one of the biggest financial free rides in modern history.
The policy was adopted in 2001 as an emergency measure to inflate prices and prop up the country's teetering banks.
But it also had the unintended side effect of turning the country into a huge pot of free money for the rest of the world.
That is because half a decade of near-zero interest rates has driven Japanese investors, from retirees to megabanks, to buy foreign stocks and bonds in search of higher returns.
Global markets have also gotten a boost from the so-called carry trade, in which investors borrowed cheaply in Japan to invest elsewhere.
The fear is that this flow could suddenly reverse if interest rates start to rise.
That could spell trouble for overseas markets like New York and London because Japanese investors could start selling stock and bond holdings to repatriate their money.

While most economists call these concerns overblown, they do acknowledge that there is some basis for them, because Japan is a huge buyer of foreign securities.
They also warn that the anxieties could end up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy if nervous investors start pre-emptively pulling out of financial markets.

"There is a risk of people overreacting," said Richard Jerram, a Tokyo-based economist for Macquarie Securities.

The focus of all this attention has been the Bank of Japan's governing policy board, whose nine members began a two-day meeting in Tokyo on Wednesday.

The policy also kept short-term rates near zero in the hope of ending a downward spiral in prices.
Concerns of a tightening have already been felt as long-term rates in Japan's bond market have jumped since mid-January.
One reason for all the anxiety about the behavior of Japanese investors is the size of their holdings overseas.
Japanese individuals and companies held overseas assets worth 107.7 trillion yen, or $915 billion, at the end of 2004, according to the Finance Ministry, the most recent data available.
The pace of Japanese investment overseas has also been quickening in recent years.
According to Bank of Japan, Japanese investors bought foreign securities worth about 9.9 trillion yen in the three months that ended in Sept. 30, three times as much as a year earlier.

A reversal of these huge flows of cash could have even broader ripple effects in the global economy, some economists say.
If money grows scarcer in the United States, interest rates could rise there, too.
Economists say this could lead to a situation -- far-fetched but not entirely implausible -- in which the Bank of Japan deflates the American real estate market, as homebuyers face more expensive mortgages.

"It probably won't happen, but there's always the possibility of unexpected consequences," said Atsushi Nakajima, chief economist at the research arm of Mizuho Financial, which is based in Tokyo.
The bank's decision could also have huge consequences for Japan's own $4.6 trillion economy, which is finally growing again.
This has fueled a political debate between bank supporters, who caution against undermining its independence, and detractors, who warn that tightening too soon could hurt the recovery.
The Bank of Japan feared that maintaining easy money for too long could cause the reviving economy to overheat, possibly creating inflation or a stock market bubble.
The Bank of Japan's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, has repeatedly said that he would like to return policy to a more "normal" footing as soon as consumer prices show sustained gains, a sign that deflation is over.

Such discretion is all well and good, Fed watchers say.
Even the big payoff after so many years as Fed chairman goes lightly challenged in this era of big payoffs for brand-name personalities -- from former President Bill Clinton on down -- who leave government for the private sector.
But the speed with which Mr. Greenspan cashed in has raised questions among critics.
So have the unintended consequences.
"It is an unusual performance on his part because of the secrecy associated with the Fed," said Albert Wojnilower, a contemporary of the 80-year-old Mr. Greenspan and a famous Wall Street economist in his own right in the 1980's.
"There are literally hundreds of Fed staffers and former staffers, and you hardly see any of them speaking out of turn.
If Greenspan had waited three months, he would have no longer been thought of as privy to the Fed."
Even limiting himself to innocuous remarks, said James Glassman, senior domestic economist for J. P. Morgan Chase, Mr. Greenspan should have anticipated how they would be twisted.

"He has to know that people who report what he says at this sort of private gathering -- they can put words in his mouth," Mr. Glassman said.

Mr. Greenspan's predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, also cashed in after he left the Fed in 1987, but not as soon after or as spectacularly.
During his tenure, his savings, which add up now to a reported net worth of $4 million to $8 million, were invested in one-year Treasury bills.
"I sat around scratching my head for quite a while," Mr. Volcker remembered in an interview this week, adding that his indecision "drove my wife crazy."
But for the first six months of his post-Fed life, he turned to speaking for income, as Mr. Greenspan has.

Bill Leigh, who books high-end speakers as head of his own firm, said that the range for celebrities of Mr. Greenspan's stature is $90,000 to $150,000 a speech.
So far he is the only associate.
He is operating with a support staff of fewer than five people.
They occupy a rented two-office suite: his office and the one occupied by the staff.
His room is modernistic and brightly lighted, paneled in light brown wood.
The dominant feature, apart from the bay window and sitting area, is Mr. Greenspan's large dark-wood desk -- strewn with papers, like his desk often was at the Fed.
Two imposing flat screens are set up on a side table at a right angle to the desk.
They suggest a sophisticated computer system giving him access to much of the vast array of data once available to him at the Fed.

Mr. Greenspan, in any case, is not selling his expertise to clients, at least not yet.

Mr. Greenspan's daily schedule has changed very little.

The 10 hours go mostly to writing his memoir.
He has promised his publisher, Penguin Press, the first draft by the end of the year.
A collaborator -- probably David Wessel, the deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal -- will shape the second draft, after which Mr. Greenspan said that he would do the third, which he hopes will be the final manuscript.
The 10-page proposal for the book promises, among other things, first-person, narrative detail about such earth-shaking events during his Fed tenure as the 1987 stock market crash, the economic reverberations from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

As a self-described free market libertarian -- that is, one who believes in a market system with limited government involvement -- he welcomed the rise of a global economy and, with the end of the cold war and the collapse of planned economies, "the gradual integration of educated, low-wage workers into the global work force."
Lest the book proposal sound too heavily weighted with economics, Mr. Greenspan promises some early life history, including the influence of his mentor, the author and novelist Ayn Rand, who shaped him as a young man into a libertarian.
And he will describe his "encounters with, and impressions of" numerous politicians, cabinet members, presidents and world leaders.
Turning to politics, he plans to argue that the current "ideological divide" separating conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats leaves "a vast untended center from which a well-financed independent presidential candidate is likely to emerge in 2008 or, if not then, in 2012."
His reputation as a forecaster, though, rests more on his economic insights than his political predictions.
He promised to delve "into the forces that will determine how the next decades are likely to unfold," concluding approvingly that "global competitive pressures are likely in the years ahead to bias most market-oriented economies toward the U.S.
model."

Yet the job market may not remain as robust as it now appears, as employment over the last two months has been inflated by exceptionally mild weather.
Temperatures across the country averaged 36.3 degrees from December through February, making it the fifth warmest winter since 1895.

"I still expect construction to be adding jobs but at a more modest pace," said Ken Simonson, chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of America, a trade group based in Arlington, Va. A backlog of home orders and continued strength in commercial real estate should keep contractors busy.
Brian Bethune, United States economist at Global Insight, an economic analysis firm in Lexington, Mass., said that if one excluded the temporary effect of the balmy winter -- as well as some boost to jobs from the reconstruction efforts on the Gulf Coast -- employment growth is averaging about 180,000 jobs a month.

Indeed, some sectors remain exceptionally weak.
Manufacturing employment contracted by 1,000 jobs in February -- its first decline since September -- as the nation's beleaguered automotive industry cut 10,600 jobs, offsetting gains at makers of electronics, machinery and other products.

Wars followed -- briefly in Slovenia, then in Croatia, most devastatingly in Bosnia, and finally in Kosovo.
"The national and historic being of Serbs is a liberating one," Mr. Milosevic declared during his rise to power in the 1980's.
It was to this vision that he and many of his disoriented people clung through the discovery of an array of Serbian concentration camps in Bosnia in 1992 and even through the killing of thousands of Muslims near the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995.

That the killings of six men could have such an effect in Serbia after the killings of tens of thousands of Muslims at Serbian hands was one measure of the powers of Mr. Milosevic as an illusionist.
Even today, as a democratic but still traumatized and relatively isolated Serbia tries to move toward membership of the European Union, the country's ability to face what happened under Mr. Milosevic often appears limited.

The unraveling that Mr. Milosevic set in motion has proved immensely costly to his people and his region.

Shares of North Fork, which is based in Melville, N.Y., jumped 15 percent, or $3.80, to $29.20.
Under the agreement, North Fork shareholders will receive cash or stock valued at $31.18 a North Fork share, which represents a 22.8 percent premium over the closing price on Friday of North Fork shares.
The high premium may lead other regional banks to consider putting themselves up for sale.
The North Fork deal is part of a strategy that Capital One has been pursuing for years.

Capital One, which has excelled at reaching consumers through direct mail, plans to take advantage of North Fork's branches as well as its expertise in attracting small and midsize business customers.
It also hopes to put its marketing muscle behind its products, hoping to ramp up sales of mortgages and home equity loans.
Starting sometime next year, all North Fork branches will adopt the more widely recognized Capital One name.
"To do this without a consolidated brand would be, frankly, silly."
With so little overlap between the companies, Capital One expects the deal to start generating pretax benefits of about $275 million in 2008.
Besides potential integration problems, there are other risks.
For North Fork, the deal is the final chapter for the small Long Island community bank that transformed itself through a series of acquisitions into one of the New York market's major players.
Over the last decade or so, it has been highly successful.
But with a flat yield curve in interest rates, a slowdown in the mortgage market, and intense New York area competition, its long-term prospects have recently been dim.

The Wal-Mart Bank would not accept normal deposits or lend money.

But even for this limited purpose, the bank has generated an impressive list of opponents, on both the left and the right.
The group includes big-business lobbyists, small banks, influential Republicans, Senator Hillary Clinton (who once was on Wal-Mart's board) and regular Wal-Mart critics like the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
They worry that the new bank is a Trojan horse.
Eventually Wal-Mart may help its customers open checking accounts and pay them interest.
Imagine that.
FOR all the criticism of Wal-Mart -- much of it deserved -- you simply cannot argue with the fact that the company saves its customers money.
It roots out inefficiencies, cuts the price on a product and forces its competitors to match.
That is why it is easily the nation's most popular store.
Now think about what would happen if Wal-Mart applied its legendary price-cutting to banking.
Because starting a new bank is quite difficult, banks have been able to get away with things that other companies just can't.
They refuse to give you access to money for days after you cash a check, even though the money itself now moves within minutes.
And they have long ignored low-income families, because the banks can make enough money elsewhere.

As a result, many of these families pay exorbitant fees to cash checks.
They have credit card interest rates and mortgage rates that look as if they came out of the 1980's.
It is not just poor people who are ill served by the financial-services business, either.
More than half of American families still do not have their own retirement accounts.

Robert B. Reich, the former labor secretary who was often a lonely voice of liberalism among the Clinton administration's economic centrists, describes Wal-Mart as "not my favorite employer -- far from it."
But he is also in favor of a Wal-Mart bank, for the very liberal-sounding reason that it would improve life for ordinary people.
All the opposition to the plan, he added, "is a pretty good indication that consumers would be helped if Wal-Mart could get in somehow."

To see what he means, take a look at just about the only thing Wal-Mart does that remotely resembles banking.
At customer service desks near the front of most stores, you can cash a check for a flat fee of $3.
By comparison, many check-cashing stores charge 3 percent of a check's value, or more than $10 on a $350 paycheck.
Not surprisingly, Wal-Mart's check-cashing business is booming.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But it is still no bargain.
A two-income family that cashes all of its weekly checks at Wal-Mart could spend close to 1 percent of its after-tax income on the fees.
Most of us with checking accounts pay nothing at all.
So we allow Wal-Mart into one of the most exploitative parts of financial services, but we do not let the company try to make money by offering truly useful services.
We let it offer a Wal-Mart-branded credit card (through General Electric) but do not let it sell retirement accounts to all the moderate-income Americans who shop there.
"Banks talk about going after the 'unbanked,' " said Jane J. Thompson, president of Wal-Mart's financial-services group, "but they don't do much to make them comfortable or to welcome them in."

Next month, banking regulators will hold hearings in the Washington and Kansas City, Mo., areas on Wal-Mart's application for a narrow charter.
In an ideal world, the hearings would be examining how a Wal-Mart bank would need to be monitored differently from one owned by an investment company.
The government would have to make sure, for example, that the bank was not pushing loans on customers to get them to buy more items at the store.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Unfortunately, though, these hearings will be more of a sideshow.
Wal-Mart executives say they no longer plan to start a real bank, at least not anytime soon.
Instead, they are signing 15-year leases to rent space to existing banks, which are then opening branches inside Wal-Mart stores.
And the company's application for a charter -- which, again, would allow it to reduce its own credit card processing fees -- will probably be approved, despite the opposition.
But I don't think this issue is going to go away.
Ben S. Bernanke, the new Federal Reserve chairman, has been saying recently that the law should be clearer about what kinds of companies can own banks.
Eventually, there needs to be a larger discussion about why we unnecessarily restrict bank competition -- an issue that should resonate with both Republicans and Democrats.
Remember that this is not a fight between Wal-Mart and the little guy.
It's a fight between Wal-Mart and Wall Street.

For the last year, retail prices are up 3.6 percent, down from 4 percent in January, and the core rate is up 2.1 percent, unchanged from the month before.
[Page C6.]
The Fed's rate-setting committee is scheduled to meet on March 27 and 28, and is widely expected to raise its benchmark short-term rate by another quarter-point, to 4.75 percent.
Many on Wall Street are now betting that the new Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his colleagues may stop after that or engineer only one more rate increase, to 5 percent, before taking a rest.
"There is certainly nothing from the core inflation numbers to egg the Fed on to keep tightening," James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS, said.

One category drawing more attention recently is rents, which increased 0.3 percent last month from January and 3.1 percent from a year earlier.
Stronger hiring and slowing home purchases appear to be driving down high vacancy rates for apartments and forcing up rents.
Clothing prices are also expected to rebound, and there is lingering concern that businesses will feel freer to pass on the high costs of energy and transportation to customers as the economy strengthens.
"This was a pretty tame report," said David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, "but there are at least a few categories that are going to show some acceleration going forward."

"It's a market that is trying to find its footing," said Nicholas Buss, a senior vice president at PNC Financial Services' real estate finance group.
Mr. Buss expects home sales to fall by about 10 percent this year.
Still, the number of homes under construction in February increased 0.6 percent, to 1.43 million, its highest level since February 1974, an indication that home building is strong by historical standards.
Rebuilding in the Gulf Coast areas hit by hurricanes, an effort that is only now getting under way on a large scale, is also likely to bolster construction in coming months, Mr. Buss said.
The number of housing permits issued, an indication of future construction activity, fell 3.2 percent, to an annual pace of 2.15 million, after rising 6.8 percent in January.

A combination of Merck and Schering would create the second-largest drug maker in Germany after Bayer, with annual sales of $13 billion.

Buyers say they no longer feel pressured to make an offer the moment they step over the doorsill.

Of course, the real estate market in the New York City suburbs has long had its ups and downs.
But over time, houses there have proved to be extraordinary investments because people want to be close to the city while enjoying the relative safety and good public schools the suburbs offer.

Frank Anthony, a sales associate for Coldwell Banker in Mendham, N.J., called the current market "town sensitive."

For all the talk of a bubble, prices do not seem ready to collapse or even edge south, with the exception of houses whose price tags were plainly inflated.
Brokers say the $1 million mark seems to be a dividing line: houses priced for less sell quickly, while houses listed for more are sitting longer and, in some cases, going for less than their list prices.
The most recent statewide real estate data for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut show that housing prices continued to appreciate late last year, but at a less breathless clip than the year before.
According to Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist and assistant vice president for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the growth rate in the price of an average house peaked at the same moment in all three states, the third quarter of 2004.

By comparison, in the last quarter of 2005, housing prices in New York rose 12.6 percent over the year before, 11.9 percent in Connecticut and 14.6 percent in New Jersey.
And some brokers believe that housing prices may be leveling off.

"It's like going from 60 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour," Ms. Rosen said of the rise in prices.
"We're just decelerating.
It looks like the market is moving away from its peak."
Armed with reports of an easing market and steeped in Internet research, some buyers are heading to open houses with raised hopes, expecting to find a house or a condominium they can not only afford but also actually want to inhabit.
Some are equating a softening market with falling prices; they are often disappointed.
"There's been so much talk about the market changing, but I don't see anything dramatic.
When you talk about a drop, it should be significant."
What many buyers do report is greater choice.

For sellers, the new market dynamic can lead to frustration.
He has since dropped the price twice, to $519,900.
He believes his house stands out because of the abundant custom wood molding he installed himself.
"The discouraging part is that when the people go through the house, they don'teven take that into consideration," he said.
"You could have holes in the house and it wouldn't matter."

Other sellers are newly self-conscious about the style of their house.
Contemporaries, ranches and split-levels tend to sell more slowly than traditional houses, but that is even more true in a softening market, brokers say.
Lori and Greg Margolis are about to put their 1960's ranch in Harrison on the market for $2.2 million.
It is a sizable property: 4,000 square feet on one and a half acres.
They have transformed the house, which Mrs. Margolis termed a "complete 1980's abomination," by renovating the bathrooms and painting the rooms stark colors.
Still, she is approaching the listing with trepidation.
"It's a nice house, but it's a certain look.
The buyers in Westchester are not eclectic.
It's very conservative.
This house in L.A. would be the hippest, coolest house.
People here like English country."

Buyers, for their part, are feeling the pressures of rising interest rates and limited investment potential.
The first would seem to propel buyers toward a purchase, so that they can lock in what is still a desirable rate.
The second factor -- the possibility that the market may be at its peak -- may suggest caution.
Brokers say that buyers are responding by looking for attributes that tend to prop up a home's value over time, like good schools and attractive commuting.
More buyers are taking property taxes into account, too.
Ruth Chizzini, vice president and director of relocation in Westchester for Sotheby's International Realty, said that escalating property taxes in the county were deterring some.
"When you come to New York, you can live in three states, and buyers are going with value," she said.

Of course, some towns in the region enjoy such a buzz that market shifts are not acutely felt.
There is Rye on Long Island Sound, with top-rated schools and many old and charming houses (quite a few of them mansions -- without the "Mc").

Earlier this month, a house in the prestigious Milton Point section that was listed for $1.7 million went to a sealed bid, a more civilized take on the bidding war, when the seller's broker asks all potential buyers for their best offers and terms.
Ms. Chizzini says tear-downs are still common in Rye, another sign of a superheated market: in March a builder closed on a $1.6 million house on less than a half-acre, with plans to knock it down and build anew.
And two young couples were recently competing for one of Ms. Chizzini's Rye listings -- a four-bedroom split-level asking $875,000 that, in her words, "needs everything, everything."
But for every situation like that, there is one like the town house listed in late January by Carol Ann Decker, a sales associate in the office of Country Living Associates in Westport, Conn. Mrs. Decker put the town house, in Fairfield, Conn., on the market for $535,000.

Then three other buyers expressed interest.

In "Decade of Nightmares," the scholar Philip Jenkins argues that the late 70's ushered in an era in which the liberal and libertarian ideas of the 60's were succeeded by "a more pessimistic, more threatening interpretation of human behavior" and "more sinister visions of the enemies facing Americans and their nation."
He argues that economic woes, gas shortages, "steeply rising rates of violent crime" and sensationalistic reports of serial murders and cult atrocities contributed to a "sense of pervasive national malaise, decadence and social failure," which in turn created a reservoir of fear and anxiety that fed a conservative counterrevolution, even as the Iran hostage crisis and post-Vietnam worries about America's declining status in the world were fueling calls for a more aggressive foreign policy.

The cultural historian Andreas Killen similarly argues in "1973 Nervous Breakdown" that the 70's have "entered the historical lexicon as a virtual synonym for weakness, confusion, and malaise," adding that by the end of 1973 (a year that witnessed the unraveling of the Watergate cover-up, the Arab oil embargo and the end of the Vietnam war), "the institutional failures of American society routinely evoked expressions of systemic, perhaps irreparable crisis."

Both of these books look at how many of the ideas and ideals of the 60's petered out in the 70's, and how a yearning for more traditional, moralistic values during that decade laid the groundwork for the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.
The authors' approaches, however, could not be more different.
Mr. Killen has focused less on politics per se than on pop culture reflections of the national zeitgeist, giving us an impressionistic volume that deconstructs leitmotifs from the year 1973: like the idea of parricide, which rippled beneath calls for the impeachment of President Nixon and informed movies like "Badlands"; or the mood of paranoia, which wafted through post-Watergate America and through Thomas Pynchon's classic novel, "Gravity's Rainbow."
Mr. Killen's free-associative book is smart and insightful, but at times succumbs to grandiosity, trying too hard to turn disparate phenomena into representative tropes.
He argues that "the preoccupation with air travel and its risks that overtook the nation in 1973 reflected anxieties about the larger catastrophes overtaking the American ship of state"; and he contends that Watergate (and Nixon's White House tapes) and America's first reality show "An American Family" (starring the Louds) "aroused anxieties about the hollowing out of private space" and "sounded the alarm about the breakdown of traditional authority."

As for "Decade of Nightmares," it is a much more ponderous production, dutifully sifting the many events, foreign and domestic, that helped shape the disappointing presidency of Jimmy Carter, and dutifully looking at the many factors (demographic, social and religious) that helped set the stage for the ascendancy of Ronald Reagan and Republican conservatism.
Unfortunately, the book is peppered with gross generalizations and hyperbolic assertions that undermine Mr. Jenkins's more considered assessments.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
For instance, he writes almost hysterically of growing worries in the 70's about serial murderers, child abuse, pornography and Satanism: "The generation that came of age in the late 1960's was now prepared to believe that America was under assault from armies of faceless nightmare figures.
In little over a decade, utopianism and libertarianism transformed into as threatening a social vision as had prevailed in America since the time of Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards.
What both "Decade of Nightmares" and "1973 Nervous Breakdown" very clearly do is leave the reader with a palpable sense of how the legacy of the 70's (or the anti-60's, as Mr. Jenkins terms the post-1975 years) reverberates to this day in America.
And Mr. Jenkins not only emphasizes similarities "between the economic situation then and the one that exists now" -- namely, serious deficits, lax fiscal discipline, rising energy prices and high spending on defense and national security -- but also underscores similarities in the absolutist, Manichean language employed by both the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations.

"Every one's a new challenge," said Gregory Fox, 54, an archaeologist who works on several recovery missions a year.

One of the dead men was listed as Leo M. Mustonen, age 22.
Close to the nameplate, but with a different middle initial.
His death report listed his emergency contacts as his parents, Arvid and Anna Mustonen, Finnish immigrants on Maple Street in Brainerd, Minn.
A piece of bone generated mitochondrial DNA, but for a successful match, a sample has to be drawn from a maternal relative.
The lone relatives of the airman named Mustonen were the wife and daughters of his brother, in Jacksonville, Fla. Their DNA would not be of help.

On the contrary, the senator appears to be treating her re-election bid as, among other things, a chance to prove her viability in tough parts of the New York, with Democrats and associates saying that she is aiming both to run up a big margin of victory statewide and to exceed expectations in Republican strongholds.

Rather than traveling to New Hampshire or Iowa as have the other likely presidential contenders -- she has not visited New Hampshire in roughly a decade -- Mrs. Clinton spends significant amounts of time in areas of New York that have historically been enemy territory for a Democrat.
Many of her recent stops -- in the Niagara Falls, Rochester and Syracuse regions -- are, on the surface, even more difficult political territory for her than Suffolk County, which she lost, 56 percent to 41 percent, in 2000.
The strategy is strikingly similar to the one used by George W. Bush in 1998, when he ran up the score among Hispanics and moderates in Texas during his re-election campaign as governor, allowing him to promote the results as proof of his broad electoral appeal.
Still, even if it proves successful, the approach has its limitations.
New York Republicans, by and large, are less conservative than their counterparts in the South and West, especially on social issues like abortion.

But it is also true that Mrs. Clinton has strengthened her standing in parts of the state in which she was viewed skeptically at best in 2000, and that showing her own party that she can temper her image as a liberal can only help her in 2008.

"They're going to try to write a story about her success here coming out of 2006, to try and answer some of the questions people have raised" about her ability to reach past liberal Democrats and build an appeal nationally, said David Axelrod, a Democratic media strategist.

"Some of our suburbs are old now themselves, and they need some help, so what we've tried to do is pay attention," she said, specifically citing Long Island, Westchester and suburbs upstate as the objects of her attention.
Polling data strongly suggests that Mrs. Clinton has managed to pick up what would have once seemed like unlikely support across the state, and not simply because she is running without formidable opposition.
There is even greater anecdotal evidence that the junior senator has overcome some initial concern among Republicans.

Her ability to help mostly Republican and upstate areas "has surprised everybody," Mr. Regan said.
Potentially, Mrs. Clinton could use solid gains in those communities to argue that she is viable in the outlying suburbs that have tipped the balance in the last two presidential elections -- and among white, middle-class voters in places like Ohio and West Virginia.

Mrs. Clinton's advisers would not publicly discuss what, if anything, the 2006 election might mean for any national run.
"She is single-mindedly focused on this '06 race right now," said Terry McAuliffe, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a close friend of the Clintons'.
At the same time, Mrs. Clinton could get herself into trouble if she and her strategists publicly set a bar for how well she should perform in 2006.
Indeed, aides to Mrs. Clinton are reluctant even to predict how much of the overall vote she will win.
Last time, she reached 55 percent; most Democrats believe she will do much better this fall.

Mr. Bernanke comes to the helm of the nation's central bank at a delicate moment for monetary policy.
Since the Fed started increasing interest rates, financial markets have come to expect a quarter-point rise in interest rates at pretty much every committee meeting.
But after 15 consecutive rate increases, the cycle of monetary tightening is reaching its peak as interest rates approach what is seen as a "neutral" rate that is not so high that it slows economic growth but not so low that it allows inflationary fears to come back to life.

With underlying inflation at 1.8 percent, excluding food and energy, the Fed's preferred measure is still within the range of 1 percent to 2 percent considered comfortable by most officials.
That leaves the Fed debating how far to raise rates merely to counter the risk of higher inflation as opposed to the reality of prices rising too fast.
In a note to investors, a Goldman Sachs economist, Andrew Tilton, said that "the potential for disagreement on policy decisions increases now that the Fed is roughly at 'neutral' and the data become more important."

Fed economists have argued that a slowing housing market is likely to dampen overall economic growth.
Housing, however, is not sinking yet.
Sales of existing homes rose in February, housing starts remain strong and by some measures home prices are still rising.
In testimony to Congress last month, Mr. Bernanke argued that in coming quarters the Fed's policy-setting committee "will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary policy action will be increasingly dependent on incoming data."

But he may have written himself into a corner with the earlier title, he agreed with a laugh, leaving him next time around with something like "A Little Bit Better Than Your Best Life Now."

The church, which was founded by Mr. Osteen's father, John Osteen, in a former feed store in the Lakewood district of Houston in 1959, is still run as a family affair.
But unlike some scandal-tainted TV ministries, Lakewood issues financial statements notable for their accountability.

In "Your Best Life," Mr. Osteen counsels patience, compassion, kindness, generosity and an overall positive attitude familiar to any reader of self-help books.

"There's breadth but not too much depth, but the breadth is quite spangly, exciting to look at -- that's his power," said Dr. Twitchell who called Lakewood "the steroid extreme" of megachurches.

Laceye Warner, assistant professor of the practice of evangelism and Methodist studies at Duke Divinity School, praised Lakewood's reach, but she said that "Christian faith is about relationship with God and neighbor and such form of worship has become entertainment."

WASHINGTON, March 30 - The House voted largely along party lines on Thursday to approve the main measure governing colleges and universities, adding provisions to expand student grants based on need and pressing colleges to control tuition.
The $70 billion proposal, which would renew the law until 2012, sets the terms for loans and grants along with the limits for maximum aid.
Republicans, who are particularly striving to control a soaring budget deficit by avoiding new spending, said the bill would make college more affordable.

In its final form, approved 221 to 199, the measure would simplify the financial aid application and make Pell Grants, the major grant that helps low- and middle-income students, available for summer study.
The bill would also raise the spending cap on Pell Grants to $6,000, up from $5,800.
The increase would be largely symbolic, however, as the maximum grant Congress appropriates has been frozen for four years at $4,050.

The bill would require colleges and universities that raise tuition at more than twice the rate of inflation for three years in a row to explain the increases.
But lawmakers abandoned a provision that would have set off audits by the Education Department in the event of increases.
The bill would set the interest rate for subsidized loans at 6.8 percent, regardless of whether commercial rates rise or fall.
Prices for consumer purchases excluding food and energy rose by 1.8 percent in the 12 months ended February, unchanged from the month before and slower than the 2 percent that Federal Reserve policy makers consider ideal.
Including food and energy, prices rose 2.9 percent in the last 12 months, down from 3.1 percent in January.

Many analysts expect economic growth to slow as the short-term interest rate increases by the Fed make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend money.
Mortgage applications, for instance, have already fallen by about 16 percent in the last 12 months, and the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.32 percent, up from 5.93 percent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac.
Most economists expect one more increase, to 5 percent in May, but there is less unanimity on whether the Fed will go further.
Consumers, though they are gaining faith in the economy and their own job prospects, appear to have reservations.

Some analysts say an early indication of slowing consumer spending is already evident.
Spending on durable goods, which are big-ticket items like cars, appliances and furniture that are expected to last more than three years, fell 1.9 percent in February, a sign that consumers may be starting to cut back on discretionary purchases, according to Bernard Baumohl, executive director of the Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm based in Princeton Junction, N.J.

But life isn't anime, or not always, and Mr. Ishihara may have more in common with the hip-nerd artists at Big Sight than it would initially seem.
But Japanese pride, he believes, should be inclusive: business, technology and literature, and the nation's indigenous postmodern art forms, too.
As he said Saturday, of anime, "The Japanese are inherently skilled at visual expression and detailed work."

Thus, the Tokyo International Anime Fair, of which Mr. Ishihara is chairman.
Here, anime's creators are enjoined to come up with inventive, culturally salutary and above all export-worthy cartoon concepts that will bring honor to Japan and, once and for all, unseat Mickey Mouse.
"I hate Mickey Mouse," Mr. Ishihara pronounced acidly from the podium on Saturday afternoon.
"He has nothing like the unique sensibility that Japan has."
That Japanese-cool-is-the-new-Japanese-car ideology is fine with Mr. Sato, as most things are.
If he sees the creative ascendancy of Korea and China as one day making Japanese anime obsolete, and if he moreover thinks that's a good thing, he doesn't emphasize those views here, where patriotism is as much the order of the day as satanic-looking bunnies and hip-hop bounty hunters.

He, and the like-minded colleagues he greets as he makes his way through the crowd, don't see themselves as belonging particularly to their country; if they have an affiliation at all, it's to the confederacy that the Japanese call otaku -- the vast network of slovenly, asocial and diffident fanboys who spend their days watching anime on DVD; reading the heroic, erotic, cutesy or literary comic books known as manga; and surfing the Internet.
The otaku are a proud group, in their way, but they're not used to getting medals of honor from state officials.

AMONG the most dedicated fans of anime, it has become popular to dress up as favorite characters -- not just in T-shirts and masks but in wigs, body makeup, wax prosthetics and lifelike elf ears.
The spectacle of misfits turned out as sexpots and musclemen is a considerable part of the allure of most otaku conventions.
One young man sat trembling on the floor near the entrance to the trade-show arena, where he rocked rhythmically while clutching the pink DVD cover for a show called "Pretty Cure."
Elsewhere, fans pressed in to see Mr. Sato, who was appearing with the actor Kouji Yusa to promote their latest television show, "Ergo Proxy."
Mr. Yusa, who resembles a young David Cassidy, lends his voice to the character of Vincent Row, a government worker from the provinces whose "listless" exterior, Mr. Sato explained, conceals internal reserves of "violent energy and wildness."
The fans, most of them female, were loving Vincent.
"But the more we get to know him, the more we find he's full of deep mysteries."

"Ergo Proxy" is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi story of humans and androids living together in the domed city of Romdo, "a paradise that doesn't require emotions," as the trailer puts it.
But a murder, a virus and a monster all conspire to defile paradise, induce emotions and force a mayhem in which it's unclear who is real and who is robot.
This show, Mr. Sato explained, marks a departure from past projects because it's openly about adults and "mature" themes, including what the English-language Web site Anime News Network calls "sex, drugs and extreme graphic violence."

"My anime has grown up with me," Mr. Sato explained.
In the past, when he wrote for younger characters, he entertained himself with references for an older generation: the hero of "Eureka seveN," for example, is Renton, named for a character in "Trainspotting"; his father, Adrock, is named for the Beastie Boy; and a helpful duo named Jobs and Woz are named for Steven P. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak of Apple.
All of this Mr. Sato is willing to explain, and patiently, but he does so somewhat by rote.
It's plainly no great pleasure anatomizing anime for people outside otaku culture; the plots and characters sound stupid when you spell them out, and it's much more comfortable for fanboys to be around people who just get it.
But Mr. Sato indulges the naïve questions because he is determined that his work find an audience outside Japan, among what he refers to as the "foreign otaku."
Where Mr. Ishihara's sloganeering concerns Japan's primacy, Mr. Sato's rallying cry comes closer to "Otaku of the world unite."

The Canadian variation of a minority shareholder fight is fed by several factors, including the prevalence of companies with dominant shareholders, the market influence of pension funds and Canadian laws.

Still, the crossed wires left bank watchers puzzled, especially since Mr. Trichet has labored in recent months to dispel confusion about the bank's plans.

The $83 million New Alternatives fund focuses on companies that develop and distribute alternative sources of energy.
Its co-managers are David J. Schoenwald, 56, and his father, Maurice L. Schoenwald, 86.
Shares of the fund rose 20.6 percent in the quarter, buoyed by rising energy prices and the growing interest in fuels like ethanol and in energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal power.
But the fund's long-term record is not as strong; it rose just 3.7 percent a year, on average, in the last five years.
Overseas investments, which had been capped at 35 percent of total assets before the change, now account for nearly 50 percent of assets.
"We've increased our foreign stock holdings because we're finding more profitable companies overseas, where government policy has been more supportive and more consistent than it has been in the U.S.," David Schoenwald said.

Mr. Schoenwald says he is concerned that alternative energy stocks are richly priced after their recent rally.

But it is more than a shift in the age of the anchors that is behind a network strategy to try to revivify the evening news as a franchise.

While corruption is a familiar story in Thailand, strongman politics is not.
"In Thailand when you want to do things, you have to do it the Thai way," he said.
It may be too early to write Mr. Thaksin's political epitaph, however.
An election boycott by opposition parties has left Parliament with too few delegates to convene legally.
But in the meantime, Mr. Thaksin has entrusted the government to his college friend and unelected deputy prime minister, Chitchai Wannasathit.
Indeed, some analysts suggest that Mr. Thaksin is only biding his time until public tempers cool.
He has used similar tactics to wait out previous protests, including rural opposition to a gas pipeline to Malaysia and union demonstrations against privatizing the state-owned power utility.

Mr. Thaksin's headstrong policies have often courted controversy, even ridicule.
He once raced by helicopter to a small town in a vain effort to locate a mythical hoard of wartime Japanese gold, saying it could be used to pay off the nation's foreign debts.
He suggested helping the country's financial markets by advancing Thailand's clocks past those of its eastern neighbors, to the same time zone as the financial centers of Hong Kong and Singapore.
And he fired his first central banker because the banker refused to raise interest rates, a move intended to stimulate spending by making Thai depositors feel wealthier.

While Mr. Thaksin's incorporation of aspects of microfinance earned plaudits from some economists, others derided his policies as nothing more than pork-barrel politics aimed at winning rural votes.
Some have accused Mr. Thaksin of returning Thailand to the kind of easy credit environment that set the stage for its 1997 financial crisis.
Others say that Mr. Thaksin achieved little more than coaxing his recession-racked nation to begin spending again in time to catch the updraft that came with the global recovery of 2002.

Nevertheless, after five years, Mr. Thaksin has left the country in better economic shape.
One of the important elements of the success of the Thaksin administration "was restoring confidence among the business community as well as consumer confidence," said Vincent Milton, the Bangkok-based managing director of Fitch Ratings.
Thailand's economy is on track to grow at least 4.5 percent this year, compared with the 2.2 percent growth it posted in 2001.
Exports rose 18 percent in the first two months of 2006, according to the Bank of Thailand, after growing nearly 15 percent in 2005.
Thailand's foreign currency reserves have risen to more than $50 billion.

And after years of delays, Thailand is on the verge of opening a $4 billion airport in place of the dilapidated, congested airport that now serves the capital.

But there have been allegations of corruption surrounding those accomplishments, and other troubling signs have emerged in the economy that some economists say expose the more threadbare patches of Thaksinomics.
After trying to use subsidies to offset the impact of rising oil prices, Thailand eliminated subsidies for gasoline in late 2004 and last year lifted subsidies on the diesel fuel that powers many of the pickup trucks favored by working-class Thais.
The subsequent rise in fuel prices helped push inflation above 6 percent, tipping Thailand into a trade deficit last year and dampening consumer spending.
At the same time, easy credit has sent household debt as a percentage of income to more than 57 percent, from below 50 percent in 2001.

But the most immediate concern to economists is what will happen to Mr. Thaksin's privatization and spending policies now that he has stepped aside.

This is the period when the Orange Order, the staunchly Unionist Protestant society, marches through Catholic communities in Northern Ireland.

While these provocative parades have occurred annually since 1795, the word in the pubs and on the street is that nobody should be surprised if these marches are disrupted more frequently and more violently than they have been in the past.
If this happens, sectarian chaos can be expected to ensue.
Gerry Doherty, who served 15 years in Long Kesh prison for blowing up the Guildhall in Londonderry in 1973, is also worried that dissident republicans could return Northern Ireland to the most violent days of the Troubles.
"What do they want to do, fight for another 30 years?"
"We couldn't beat the British, how do they think they're going to do it?"
It is not only republican dissidents who are the concern.
Unionists with their own paramilitaries and a history of anti-Catholic violence have so far refused to turn in their weapons.
To them, the British military drawdown amounts to abandonment, an endorsement of a Dublin-led Ireland.
It is no secret that Unionist paramilitaries are just as eager to see the peace process scuttled, forcing the British to maintain a strong military presence.

Mortgage delinquencies have already started climbing, although they remain at relatively low levels.
In the fourth quarter of last year, 4.7 percent of all home mortgages were delinquent, up from 4.4 percent in the third quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
A delinquent loan is one in which monthly payments are past due for 60 days or more.
But experts note that by past standards borrowing costs still remain modest and that the recent interest rate increases may have only a limited effect on economic growth.
For many Americans, the growing number of jobs and improvements in incomes are likely to outweigh the impact of higher mortgage costs.

"We have seen some moderation in buying from Asia, and I think we will continue to see that," Ms. Kung said, noting that recent interest rate increases by central banks in Europe and Japan were conditioning investors to higher borrowing costs across the world.
The Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that the burden of higher interest costs would fall on about 7 percent to 8 percent of all homeowners.

He also soils himself as if there were no tomorrow.
I'm the first to admit that he has a thing or two to learn before he can be shot into space or allowed to fly an F-16.
But in principle, he's a complete person wrapped in a 19-inch package, and not just any person, but a very extreme one, an eccentric, a character.
The kind you respect but may not completely understand.
Because, like all complex people, regardless of their height or weight, he has many sides.
My son, the enlightened: As someone who has read a lot about Buddhism and has listened to two or three lectures given by gurus and even once had diarrhea in India, I have to say that my baby son is the first enlightened person I have ever met.
He truly lives in the present: he never bears a grudge, never fears the future.
He's totally ego-free.
He never tries to defend his honor or take credit.
His grandparents, by the way, have already opened a savings account for him, and every time they rock him in his cradle, Grandpa tells him about the excellent interest rate he managed to get for him and how much money, at an anticipated single-digit average inflation rate, he'll get in 21 years when the account comes due.
The little one makes no reply.
But then Grandpa calculates the percentages against the prime interest rate, and I notice a few wrinkles appearing on my son's forehead -- the first cracks in the wall of his nirvana.

My son, the junkie: I'd like to apologize to all the addicts and reformed addicts reading this, but with all due respect to them and their suffering, nobody's jones can touch my son's.
Like every true addict, he doesn't have the same options others do when it comes to spending his leisure time -- those familiar choices of a good book, an evening stroll or the N.B.A.
playoffs.
For him, there are only two possibilities: a breast or hell.
"Soon you'll discover the world -- girls, alcohol, illegal online gambling," I say, trying to soothe him.
But until that happens, we both know that only the breast will exist.
Lucky for him, and for us, he has a mother equipped with two.
In the worst-case scenario, if one breaks down, there's always a spare.

My son, the psychopath: Sometimes when I wake up at night and see his little figure shaking next to me in the bed like a toy burning through its batteries, producing strange guttural noises, I can't help comparing him in my imagination to Chucky in the horror movie "Child's Play."
They're the same height, they have the same temperament and neither holds anything sacred.
That's the truly unnerving thing about my 2-week-old son: he doesn't have a drop of morality, not an ounce.
Racism, inequality, insensitivity, discrimination -- he couldn't care less.
He has no interest in anything beyond his immediate drives and desires.
As far as he's concerned, other people can go to hell or join Greenpeace.
All he wants now is some good milk or relief for his diaper rash, and if the world has to be destroyed for him to get it, just show him the button.
He'll press it without a second thought.
My son, the self-hating Jew.. .
"Don't you think that's enough?"
my wife says, cutting in.
"Maybe instead of dreaming up hysterical accusations against your adorable son, you could do something useful and change him?"
THIS includes everything from T-shirts that bear the simple slogan: "Tom is not my friend" (a reference to Tom Anderson, the co-founder of MySpace and his cutesy habit of adding himself, and his visage, to every new member's "friends" list) to thriving, pile-on discussions among veteran Web users who find the design skills of many MySpacers to be, well, so 1995.

"Visit any random profile on MySpace, and you are instantly beamed back to the Bad Old Days of Web design, with flashing graphics, unreadable text and -- worse -- random songs that start playing unbidden," wrote John August, a screenwriter from Los Angeles, in his blog last week.
It is a common complaint against the behemoth -- "the Google of social networking," as Mr. August put it -- which now has something on the order of 50 million users.
That is, for all of the hand-wringing that parents and the press do over cyberpredators and other dangers attending the MySpace phenomenon, a much more passionate undercurrent of MySpace invective is fed by a simpler lament: Why, critics ask, must the most popular social networking site on the planet be typified by a garish, kitchen-sink aesthetic and a girls-gone-wild I.Q.?

That appears to be at least partly behind the grievances expressed by two revolutionaries identifying themselves as Katie McIntyre and Casey Primeau.
They have published a little online "manifesto" that explains why, in their opinion, MySpace does something that I am not really at liberty to describe in these pages.
The title of the manifesto concludes with "and So Do You," with suitable misanthropy.

Among the reasons for MySpace's lameness, according to the manifesto, are My-Space features like "Cool New People" ("Why anyone would label these folks 'Cool' is beyond our comprehension"); the "About Me" section ("Chances are no one comes to your MySpace to learn about how you 'dont hav much 2 say' about yourself"); and, of course, Tom ("How does a lonely, single nerd become the antichrist of the Internet?").

"And by support group, we mean a chainsaw to the face."

A similar subtlety can be found on anti-MySpace sites like WorstOfMySpace.com.
The site makes occasional nominations for the most haphazard, graphically overindulged MySpace pages, and the most recent candidate (snipurl.com/JesusCowboy) exemplifies the sort of Frankenstein creation that critics find deserving of scorn.
It is a frenzy of animated devotional graphics and random bits of scripture set to the pulsating rhythms of the Christian rock band Petra.
The word "Jesus" rains down the page in an effect that the proprietor of WorstOfMySpace describes as having been "cool for a day back in 1997" and "cheesier than an episode of 'Blossom.'
"Ugh, no thanks," wrote one user, 19thNervousBreakdown, responding to news of the Nielsen Top 10.
"That place is the most awful cesspool on the Internet."
It is the kind of place, he suggested, where one finds "girls with six inches of cake makeup posing for cleavage shots, guys dressed up like Gotti with one eyebrow raised, and the most inane, unintelligible comments imaginable."

ANOTHER user, Firehed, suggested that "anyone publishing content should have an understanding of the medium on which it's being published," adding that those unfamiliar with basic Web page design "really shouldn't be putting stuff online and thinking highly of themselves, as the MySpacers tend to."

But therein, defenders of MySpace say, lies the rub.
"Because most people have terrible design sense, most profiles look pretty terrible," Mr. August, the screenwriter, noted, "but they look exactly how the user wants them to look.
This element of self-expression is a large part of why teens and tweens and twenty-somethings love their MySpace."
Indeed, one can reasonably argue that MySpacers do not fancy themselves A-list designers and programmers, nor professional photographers or wits.
It is "a place for friends," after all.
Aesthetes and code-snobs need not apply.
"MySpace is popular BECAUSE it doesn't look 'professional,' " wrote Robert Scoble, Microsoft's "technical evangelist," in a discussion of the topic on his blog last month.
"It's approachable."

"Yes, there are some horrific sites out there that are completely standards incompliant, that are garish, that cause your browser to crash, that take an hour to load and have horrific Celine Dion music in the background," wrote a Slashdot user called Transmogrify--UK, in a stirring defense of MySpace on Friday, "but does it really matter?"

Mr. Weill's successor, Charles O.
Prince III, the chief executive, assumes the post of chairman today.
Citigroup, to be sure, is not sending Mr. Weill away with nothing more than a gold watch and a big thank-you.
About 350 of New York's political, financial and cultural elite were expected to attend, including James Dimon of J. P. Morgan Chase; Philip J. Purcell, the former chief of Morgan Stanley; the Rev.
Jesse Jackson; and the cellist Yo-Yo Ma.
The celebration was as much about Mr. Weill's charitable activities -- for Carnegie Hall, the Joan and Sanford I. Weill Medical College of Cornell and a national education initiative -- as it is about his leadership of Citigroup.

The party also seemed to suggest the passing of an era.
At a time when Wall Street seems to be increasingly dominated by hedge funds and private equity firms run by nameless and faceless yet undoubtedly powerful financiers, Mr. Weill, once a volatile and insecure boy from Brooklyn, is a throwback.
He is among the last of the classic deal makers who broke many of the rules and rewrote history on Wall Street.

Under a 10-year consulting contract with Citigroup, he will earn a daily rate of $3,846 for dispensing advice for up to 45 days a year.
Citigroup will also cover the costs of a car and driver, health and life insurance for him and his wife, Joan, and rent for an office in the General Motors Building, as well as administrative support.

"They ended up doing me a big favor.

By now, the story of how Mr. Weill rose to become one of the world's most powerful bankers is well known.
After being ousted as president of American Express in the mid-1980's, Mr. Weill began rebuilding his career at a down-and-out consumer lending outfit in Baltimore called Commercial Credit.
Over time and through a series of quick and sometimes messy acquisitions, including Primerica and Travelers, the insurance company, Mr. Weill and his team of deal makers cobbled together a financial services behemoth.

But in the eyes of Mr. Weill's critics, those returns came at a high price.
During his career, Mr. Weill often turned harshly against some of his closest confidants, mostly notably Mr. Dimon, who now is at the helm of J. P. Morgan Chase.

Others were critical of the free-wheeling culture and loose controls within Citigroup, contending that it had become too unruly for Mr. Weill's successor, Mr.
Prince, to manage.
Indeed, after a series of scandals overseas, the Federal Reserve took the unusual step early last year of telling Citigroup to forgo further deals until it could get its controls in order.
When Mr. Weill gets out of bed tomorrow, he will start what he calls the next chapter of his life, in which he plans to devote more time to his many nonprofit educational, medical and culture organizations and to give away much of what he spent a lifetime accumulating.

When asked about some of his nonprofit pursuits, Mr. Weill becomes even more animated, speaking at some length about three groups in particular: the National Academy Foundation, a nationwide network of career-themed "schools within schools" that he founded; Carnegie Hall, where he has been chairman for the last 15 years; and the Weill Cornell Medical College.
"We talk every day or so, sometimes several times a day," said Antonio M. Gotto Jr., a professor of medicine and dean of the medical college.
Mr. Weill is also having a yacht built, which should be finished this summer, and said he hoped to play a little more golf.

When swaps perform as advertised, they do indeed make it cheaper for governments to borrow.
But when something goes wrong, they can wreak havoc.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Experts say blowups are the exception.
But because governments are not required to report the details of their swap activity, no one knows for sure the extent of the total exposure, or where the trouble spots may lie.
"The public needs to better understand the nature of these transactions," said Robert H. Attmore, chairman of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, an independent group that writes accounting rules for state and local governments.

One example of what can go wrong is now playing out at the Delaware River Port Authority, which handles bridges, railroads and other transportation services near Philadelphia for Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In 2001, the port authority was planning to sell $358 million of bonds.
Officials wanted to economize by using a floating interest rate, much as a home buyer might choose a variable-rate mortgage because it has a lower interest rate than a fixed-rate mortgage.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But the port authority also wanted to protect itself from future interest rate increases.
So it struck a side agreement with UBS Securities, involving a type of derivative called an interest rate swap option, or swaption.
The swaption gave UBS an option which, if exercised, would start streams of payments between the port authority and UBS.
The terms meant that UBS would get the larger payment if interest rates fell below a certain point, and the port authority would get larger payments if rates rose above it.
The swap was thus meant to serve as a hedge for the port authority, with the possible stream of payments from UBS offsetting the rising amounts it would have to pay its bondholders if rates moved up.

The concept may have been sound, but in the real world things turned out differently.
Before the bonds could be issued, the governors of Pennsylvania and New Jersey had a falling-out over plans to dredge a long stretch of the Delaware River.
That caused a split on the port authority's board, making it impossible to issue the bonds.
Meanwhile, interest rates have remained low, prompting UBS to exercise its swap option and start collecting its money.
Now the authority must make payments to UBS every month, even though the bonds were never sold.

The port authority's recent financial statements do not show that the problems were looming.
But they did not show how big the payments might be, or explain the risks.

Randal J. Finden, who is managing the accounting board's derivatives project, said interest rate swaps can be tricky to evaluate because they sometimes go through periods when they look like losers, only to recover when interest rates change.
He has been trying to devise a series of tests that would identify swap agreements that are irretrievable failures.
In his approach, governments that find they are caught in unsuccessful swap contracts would be required to show the failures on their balance sheets.
They would report a liability in the amount that it would cost to buy out of the swap contract.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Getting out of a failed swap can mean making a huge payment.
The port authority's swap with UBS would probably fail the tests Mr. Finden is devising, because the swap is not serving any valid hedging purpose.
The accounting board has no regulatory power, and Mr. Finden, the derivatives project's manager, said the board was not trying to discourage governments' use of derivatives.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Still, public finance experts say that fuller disclosure would bring failed derivatives out into the open quickly.
That, in turn, could motivate governments to cut their losses when a swap contract fails, rather than pouring more money into an unsuccessful transaction in hopes that interest rates will eventually turn in their favor.
Peter L. Block, a director in Standard & Poor's government ratings division who has been analyzing governments' use of swaps, said analysts like him were eager to see what would show up once the new accounting procedures come into force.
Mr. Block said he was guessing that most swaps would pass the coming accounting test.
"If 98 percent are stable," he said, "you want to know about the 2 percent that aren't, because you might have big exposure to them."
Some analysts have attributed the sales dip to continuing negative fallout from the controversy that surrounded Guidant's decision not to alert doctors that some of its defibrillators had short-circuited.
Other analysts have speculated that doctors have been more selective in deciding which patients should receive defibrillators, devices that restore a chaotic heart rhythm.

Boston Scientific and its shareholders may see a less robust return than expected on the huge investment in Guidant.

Since December, when Boston Scientific, based in Natick, Mass., made its first bid for Guidant, its stock price has fallen more than 15 percent.
That drop will reduce the value of its bid to about $26.5 billion, a decline of about $500 million from the time the deal was announced.
It will also mean that Guidant shareholders will receive more Boston Scientific shares -- 1.6799 shares for each Guidant share, up from 1.3167 shares.

To help finance its bid for Guidant, Boston Scientific has agreed to sell Guidant's coronary stent business to Abbott Laboratories, which is also taking a stake in Boston Scientific as part of the deal.

A crucial early test for Boston Scientific will be whether it can re-establish Guidant in the good graces of doctors, who are upset that they were not informed fully or on a timely basis about the defects, said Thomas J. Gunderson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray & Company in Minneapolis.

Easy for him to say.
An awful lot of Americans have gotten into the habit of seeing their homes as virtual cash machines.
Whereas using a credit card is truly spending borrowed money, cashing out equity can seem more like using funds you (or your house) have "earned."
In 1995, according to Freddie Mac, homeowners cashed out $11.2 billion in equity; the estimated amount for 2005 is $243 billion.
Those figures do not include the additional money people have borrowed through lines of credit.
But the last thing homeowners need now is the temptation to leverage themselves even further with home-equity cards, spending cash that ultimately might not be covered by their home's appreciating value.

Genie M. Driskill, chief operating officer at Synergistics Research in Atlanta, disagrees.
First, she points out, these cards are not new.
About 41 percent of lenders offer them and only about 7 percent of homeowners use plastic to obtain access to their lines of credit.
She also feels that most homeowners are cautious about using creditlike cards to tap their equity.
"There is an overriding sense that this is my home, and people are very conservative."

According to the Synergistics telephone survey in 2005, the top two ways consumers spend their home equity are on home improvements (56 percent) and debt consolidation (32 percent).
But I don't think it matters whether you spend the money at Home Depot or with a luxury cruise line.
True, putting in a new kitchen enhances your home's value, but the danger either way is the temptation to spend yourself into a hole that might be harder to climb out of than it looks.

If I signed up for a $25,000 Chase EquityCard -- which I did qualify for -- and spent $10,000 on my bathroom, I would be biting my nails until the property values in my small town had risen high enough to cover the loan, and still give me the profit I'm counting on when I sell.
Amy Crews Cutts, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac, says that home-equity lines of credit can be a tremendous blessing for those who need the savings stored in their home in the event of an emergency, like a job loss.
But she is concerned about too easy access to that money in the shape of a credit card "that looks just like every other credit card."
"It's a net plus for the American homeowner to have the opportunity for that credit," Ms. Crews Cutts said, "but it can turn into a nightmare if they aren't able to keep their finances under control."
The Dow is at its highest level since January 2000, and is only about 3 percent away from its all-time high.

The number of homes on the market rose 7 percent, to 3.2 million.
At the current sales pace, that amounts to a 5.8-month supply, up from 5.5 months in February and four months in March 2005.
Economists say the rising number of homes on the market makes it harder for sellers to demand higher prices, as buyers take advantage of greater choice and their increased bargaining power.
"The bidding fever that was present a year or so ago has all but disappeared, and that's another sign that this market is slowing," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at J. P. Morgan's private client services group.

Starting late last year, buyers and sellers of homes, particularly in the East and West Coast markets, appeared to be staring each other down.
Many buyers, sensing a slowdown coming, said they were holding out for a better deal, while sellers, believing they still controlled the market, refused to cut their prices.
The increase in sales in February and March indicate that the standoff is easing as sellers cut asking prices to lure buyers, economists said.
In many Florida and California cities, he said, investors who bought condominiums and other property in a bid to make a quick profit are scrambling to unload them as interest rates rise.

Spain and Germany have similar programs, and Italy recently introduced one as well.

The wattage can be used directly in a home or fed into a utility's power grid.

PowerLight, which was founded in 1991, already operates three interconnected clusters of solar panels in Bavaria that together generate 10 megawatts of electricity, and is building a 3-megawatt plant in Las Vegas, which will be the largest in the United States.
G.E.
's manufacturing arm makes rooftop solar panels that are appearing in California and New Jersey.
And Energy Financial Services already has $162 million invested in assorted solar projects that generate about 149 megawatts of electricity.
But solar farms remain expensive to build, and a persistent shortage of the purified silicon needed to make solar panels has been a barrier to the industry's growth.
That may change, though.
The silicon shortages are easing, and developing technologies are making solar installations more productive.
For example, the PowerLight panels used in the Portugal project track the sun as it moves across the sky, to maximize exposure.

But the central bank did not change bank deposit rates.
By raising lending rates while leaving deposit rates untouched, the government will allow banks to widen their profit margins to cover losses on loan defaults.
Moreover, by isolating deposit rates, China's move is unlikely to address calls by industrialized countries, including the Group of 7 last weekend, for China's currency to gain in value.
One-year bank deposits earn just 2.25 percent in China, and leaving that rate unchanged makes it slightly less attractive for foreign investors to pump money into China and therefore bid up the value of the yuan, the Chinese currency.
Low deposit rates also encourage Chinese consumers to spend more, a government goal, rather than save.
Urban savings rates exceed 40 percent, as families realize that the government has drastically reduced its role in providing pensions, health care and education.

Prime Minister Wen Jiabao warned on April 14 that China would move to tighten controls over lending and real estate.
But most economists were taken by surprise by the central bank's decision to raise interest rates instead of imposing other lending controls.

"They want to send a strong message that they are serious about seeing a slowdown in lending rates," said Frank Gong, the chief economist for greater China at J. P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. "I don't think this is the start of a series of hikes, but it is to send a strong message."
"It's a pre-emptive strike -- they don't want investment to accelerate any further," he said.
All the signs are that China's central bank has acted much earlier this time to rein in economic growth than it did the last time the economy threatened to overheat, in 2004.
Chinese business leaders say that the acceleration of economic growth this spring has not caused the kinds of chaotic problems that surfaced back then, like bottlenecks in some places and excesses in others.

Of the 2,977 New Jersey state troopers, only 34, or 1.1 percent, are Asian, in a state where Asians made up 7.1 percent of the population in 2004.
Asian police say, however, that the current superintendent, Col. Joseph R. Fuentes, has made a bigger effort than his predecessors to recruit members of minority groups.
Other police agencies across the nation have also been trying to bolster their proportions of Asians.
The number of Asians working for the New York Police Department has roughly doubled in recent years to 1,181, or 3.5 percent, according to Michael Collins, a deputy chief.
Nationally, only 1.6 percent of the nation's 664,000 rank-and-file police and sheriff's officers are Asian, according to the Statistical Abstract of the United States.

But in the suburbs, coveted police jobs do not open up often, and New Jersey departments, Asian police officers say, have a history of circumventing Civil Service tests and giving jobs to relatives or friends.

"I disagree with those who say Asians are not looking for police jobs, because a lot of young people approach me to say they want to work as police officers," Mr. Kim said.
Police departments are finding that Asian-American police can be particularly helpful in solving certain types of crimes, like home invasions.
Asian bandits, police say, do not typically break into houses while families are at work.
Rather, they know that Asian shopkeepers often squirrel away money in their homes.
To find it, the criminals need the shopkeeper to point out the hiding place — under the threat of a weapon.

According to a Taiwanese-born state detective, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Tony, because he does undercover work, Asian victims of home invasions will often not report crimes, worried that they will get in trouble for undeclared earnings or will expose a relative who is an illegal immigrant.

The flood of dollars to Asia would under normal circumstances push up the value of Asian currencies, raising the price of Asian goods in dollars and gradually reducing the ability of Americans to keep buying them.
But central bankers in Asia, which has long depended on exports for economic development, then need to put those earnings to work and maintain a stable currency.
They do that by buying safe investments like Treasury bonds, and that keeps their currencies from rising while lending Washington the money to finance the deficits and allowing American consumers to continue buying Toyotas and Samsung TV's and Chinese-made textiles.
That is why some countries like China have gone so far as to fix the value of the currency to the United States dollar.
Economists say the gusher of global funds became a torrent after 9/11, when the Fed and other central bankers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations steered interest rates lower in response to a growing global recession and fears of deflation.

Where once Southeast Asian markets received funds largely from Asian banks or international mutual funds specializing in the region, analysts say these days that hedge funds and pension funds are increasingly dabbling in the region's securities.
And the money is coming not only from America.
A rapidly growing private banking industry has emerged in Asia to service the appetite for risk among the new rich being created by China's rise.
Record oil prices have created a flood of petrodollars from the Middle East in search of investments.
And Japan's own banks and brokerage firms have long been venturing out in search of returns for their depositors and clients since the country's central bank set rates effectively at zero in an effort to jump-start the economy and stave off deflation.

Some fear that financial trends are poised to reverse the situation.
Some economists say that the recent plunge in Iceland's currency and stock prices portends a worldwide retreat by Japanese funds in the aftermath of the Bank of Japan's decision to end what was essentially no-interest financing.
Others say continued low interest rates in Japan will preserve this so-called yen carry trade — in which lenders borrow at low Japanese interest rate and lend at higher rates abroad — and that China's decision last month to begin allowing its own savers to begin investing abroad will only expand the amount of money sweeping global markets.
One thing is sure, economists say: Financial risk has become mispriced.
Perhaps the best evidence is in Asia's bond markets, where the cost to borrow for governments has been steadily declining.
In part, economists say, this reflects how steady capital inflows are improving government finances.
But more and more, so much cash is available that it has become a borrower's market.
Governments in Indonesia or the Philippines are now selling 10-year bonds that offer investors an interest rate only about two percentage points higher than bonds issued by the United States government, which are considered the most risk-free investment in the world.

In 2005, Emigrant Savings Bank of New York and the United States unit of HSBC dived in, as did various smaller banks around the country, all of them viewing the product as a low-cost way to bulk up by collecting deposits nationally.
In March, Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, introduced a high-yield savings account — one of the few with a checking component — along with a vow to offer one of the highest rates in the land.

Amassing deposits is an inherently good thing for banks to do.
Although deposits are liabilities, since they can be withdrawn at any time, banks use them to make loans, which are considered assets because the interest on them produces revenue.
Banks also earn money by investing depositors' cash in financial instruments.

It is the selection of those financial instruments — and the performance of them — that can determine whether a bank profits from high-yield savings accounts, bankers and industry analysts say.

For instance, they say, institutions that invest in fixed-rate assets like mortgage-backed securities could wind up in trouble if the Federal Reserve continues to bump up interest rates, while institutions that invest in floating-rate assets, which are more flexible, will be better able to swing with the punches.
And that is just one reason that high-yield accounts can be a risky or questionable product for some banks, industry analysts say.
Another is that customers might come to expect higher rates all around.

Unlike credit card users, who freely hop from one product to the next to get a better rate, savings account holders tend to be more loyal, Mr. Newman said.

During the 1980's, bonds gained popularity — at least as measured by the market value of all the bonds outstanding, peaking in 1992 at more than 42 percent of all securities.
Few liked bonds then, but since then they have been the best-performing asset class.

Grey Gardens, the 28-room house, was immortalized in 1976 by what remains a popular cult film of the same name.
A full-length feature film, starring Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore, is in the works, too.
Alternately bickering and belting out show tunes, oblivious to the rotting detritus piled up around them, they kept dozens of feral cats and fed Wonder bread to raccoons that had taken up residence in the attic.

The Beales are dead now, but open any stained and tattered book in the house and the fly page will most likely provide evidence of the former occupants.
One novel with a battered red hardcover bears this note, scrawled in pencil in Little Edie's flowery script and characteristically adamant style: "Edith Beale has read this book — and says any other person who reads — is an ass!"
Ms. Quinn recalled finding a dusty piano in the living room.

She and Mr. Bradlee still own the house but for the past dozen years have spent just one month there each summer.
The rest of the time it is leased to Ms. Hayward, who lives there when she is not at her other homes in Palm Beach, the Bahamas and Manhattan.

Like the Beales, Ms. Hayward is an animal lover who takes affection to an extreme.
But rather than allowing feral cats to populate the house or hand-feeding refined carbohydrates to nocturnal vermin, she rescues dogs — she has 10 — and is a leading patron of the Humane Society of Grand Bahama and the United States and a board member at the Animal Rescue Fund in East Hampton.
But just one of her dogs, an amiable mutt she named Amigo, is allowed at Grey Gardens.
Grey Gardens, tucked away in a remote corner of East Hampton's estate district and nearly unrecognizable from the creepy vine-covered house depicted in the Maysles brothers' film, has not been overrun by the fans who maintain various Web sites, message boards and chat rooms devoted to the Beales.
At least not yet.

DELPHI IN COURT The Delphi Corporation's motions to void its labor contracts with the United Automobile Workers will be heard in bankruptcy court tomorrow or Wednesday.
Delphi, an auto parts supplier that is under bankruptcy protection, says it needs to lower workers' wages to stay in business.
The union has threatened to strike if the contracts are thrown out.
Such a strike could hamper not only Delphi but also its biggest customer, General Motors, which spun off Delphi in 1999.
TO YOUR HEALTH Sometime during the week, the Senate is expected to vote on legislation that would pre-empt state laws and allow small businesses to pool health insurance coverage, increasing the number of people who would be able to obtain it.
President Bush strongly favors such a law.
The goal is to make health care coverage cheaper for smaller companies, but the legislation's opponents — which include AARP, the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association — say the federal standards for insurance coverage will be weaker than the state ones they supersede and will thus erode consumer protection.
AND THE WINNER IS...
The National Magazine Awards will be handed out tomorrow night.
The long list of nominees also includes The New Yorker, National Geographic, New York and Harper's, each of which received five nominations.
The American Society of Magazine Editors, which sponsors the awards in conjunction with the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, will bestow the awards at a ceremony in Lincoln Center.

Wall Street ended an uneasy session mostly lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve suggested that it might not be through raising interest rates, if necessary, to fight inflation caused by soaring energy and commodities prices.
The Fed indicated it would be closely watching economic data to determine its next step.
It could be a decade before the new studies — one American, one European — provide any answers.
"It's a slightly uncomfortable time," said Dr. Eric P. Winer, who directs the breast oncology center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
"Some of us feel like we have enough information to start backing off on chemotherapy in selected patients, and others are less convinced."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Among the less convinced is Dr. John H. Glick, director of the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
Dr. Glick tells his patients about the new data but does not suggest they skip chemotherapy.
After all, he notes, the national guidelines were based on results from large randomized clinical trials.
And the recent data indicating that some women can skip chemotherapy are based on an after-the-fact analysis of selected clinical trials.
"We're in an era where evidence-based medicine should govern practice," Dr. Glick said.
For women with breast cancer, of course, the uncertainty is excruciating.
Faced with a disease that already causes indecision and anxiety, they are now confronted with incomplete data, differing opinions from different doctors and a choice that can seem almost impossible: Should they give up a taxing treatment when all the answers are not in and they have what may be a fatal disease?
"If the medical profession is not even close to being of one mind, how is the woman to know?"
said Donald A. Berry, a statistician at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the lead author of a recent paper questioning chemotherapy's benefits in many women.

Barbara Brenner, who has had breast cancer and is executive director of the advocacy group Breast Cancer Action, said, "There's a real problem," and added, "We finally tell people at the end of the day: 'You're going to get a lot of information.
Trust your gut.
Nobody has the answers.'
Doctors worry, too.
It took two years before the National Cancer Institute and its researchers could even agree on a design for the large new American study that will test the idea that many women might safely forgo chemotherapy.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The study, which starts enrolling patients at the end of this month, will involve women whose cancers are fueled by estrogen and have not spread beyond the breast.
They will be randomly assigned to have the standard treatment — chemotherapy followed by a drug like tamoxifen that starves tumors of estrogen — or to skip chemotherapy and have treatment only with a drug like tamoxifen.
Unlike the American study, the one now planned in Europe will also include women whose cancer has spread beyond their breasts into nearby lymph nodes.
The American study may eventually add such women, said Sheila E. Taube, who directs the cancer diagnosis program at the National Cancer Institute.
"To me, the situations are analogous," she said.

The chemotherapy question starts with American and European guidelines that say almost every woman with breast cancer that has gone beyond its earliest stages, when it is confined to the milk duct, should have the treatment.
And for good reason, many cancer researchers say: a series of large studies has shown that chemotherapy saves lives and that newer and more aggressive regimens are improvements over older ones.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone.
"Part of it is that this area of medicine we're practicing in is kind of a high wire act," said Dr. Michael Lee, an oncologist in private practice in Norfolk, Va. "It is more comfortable to adopt things that are aggressive."

Now Dr. Berry, the M. D. Anderson statistician, and a group of leading cancer researchers have found that the chemotherapy benefits in those clinical trials were concentrated almost exclusively in women whose cancers were impervious to estrogen.
The drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine.

There is also another issue.
What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy?
How can they be identified?

One possibility is new genetic tests, which are part of the two studies that are about to begin.
The cancer institute is using the Oncotype DX test, which includes genes associated with response to chemotherapy, among them genes involved with a cell's response to estrogen.

The study is ethical, said Dr. Larry Norton of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, because the only women whose treatment will be decided at random are those in a kind of gray area, not women for whom chemotherapy would be a clear benefit or clearly unnecessary.

"I think the clinical trial is really a superb one," Dr. Norton said.
"I would like to see it go so we have definitive data."

In the meantime, some physicians, like Dr. Winer, are taking their own best shot at figuring out who really benefits from chemotherapy.
He asks how sensitive the tumor is to estrogen, how aggressive a pathologist believes it is, how big it is, how much has spread to the lymph nodes and whether its surface has a type of protein, HER2, that is associated with a better response to chemotherapy.
After talking through the decision with his patients, he says, he is comfortable omitting chemotherapy in some who would have had it not long ago.
Others, like Dr. Francisco J. Esteva of M. D. Anderson, use a computer program to calculate a woman's risks of recurrence and give the option of no chemotherapy only to women with low-risk cancers confined to their breasts.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Still others, like Dr. Glick, are starting to tell women with estrogen-fed cancers that although they still need chemotherapy, they may not need the most intense treatment.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do.
"I don't know that many doctors who are comfortable giving women an option about chemotherapy," said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group.
"A lot of physicians talk about the data, but then they say, 'But, to be on the safe side.
...' "
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Still, doctors say it is not simply that they are urging more and more chemotherapy on patients.
In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.
"A cancer diagnosis is earth-shattering," said Dr. Lee, who has had cancer himself.
"You stay up at night.
You wonder.
Even when you're doing well, you don't know whether to trust it."
And so, he said, "a lot of people will take a treatment even if there is a very low statistical chance that they will benefit."
After a long discussion with Ms. Baty and her husband, Dr. Esteva left them so they could decide what to do.

"My husband said, 'Look, we have two little kids,' " Ms. Baty recalled.
"I called the doctor back in and said, 'We're doing the chemo.'
Women who say they want the most aggressive treatment may not fully realize what they are asking for, said Mary Peelen, 45, of San Francisco.
She had an aggressive regimen, suffered terribly and was left with painful nerve damage in her arms and hands that prevents movements like opening jars or using scissors and frequently makes her drop things.
Ms. Peelen feels that in a way, she just missed the revolution, perhaps one of the last women with her type of cancer who will have to suffer so much.

For now, the answers as to who should have chemotherapy are far from clear.
"I think practice should change, but it's very dicey," said Dr. Berry, of M. D. Anderson.
His colleague Dr. Esteva says it is one thing for a statistician like Dr. Berry to look at retrospective data, and another for a physician, like himself, to sit down with a patient who has to make what may be a life-or-death decision.
"It's not a perfect science," Dr. Esteva said.
"A statistically small reduction in risk may be very important to some women, while for others chemotherapy is not worth it."
And so, Dr. Esteva said, he is left asking many women with early-stage breast cancer to decide what can seem like the undecidable: whether they want "to take something potentially toxic when you have a 90 percent chance of being cured without it."

ven to call politics in France a profession puts the case too weakly; it's more like a mandarinate.
The French view the state — l'État, always capitalized — with a reverence that can seem anachronistic in a world in thrall to the marketplace.
The national educational meritocracy funnels the brightest boys and girls into the great preparatory institutions in Paris, above all the Institut d'Études Politiques, known as Sciences Po, and the École Nationale d'Administration, or ENA.

Ségolène Royal is a rare insider-outsider who managed to get her ticket punched at all the mandarin way stations without ever appearing to join, or even to aspire to join, the old boys' club.
She had to fight her way in; and the fight has never left her.
Life for the eight Royal children, first in Dakar and then in Lorraine, in eastern France, was joyless and harsh, according to accounts Royal has freely offered.
We were sitting in the back seat of a chauffeured car one spring evening after a few local events of the sort that she both enjoys doing and encourages journalists to watch her doing.
Royal, who is 52, was impeccably turned out in a short cocoa-colored jacket and matching flared skirt.
Her manner was straightforward, with few of the girlish high notes that even highly successful French women have a way of striking.
(Our discussions were in French; she says that she understands English, but cannot speak it.)

"Yes, my teachers."
"Anyone in your family?
Your mother?"
"No."
The dark fairy tale is central to her own narrative of resistance and resilience.
"I see a goal, I organize myself accordingly, I evaluate, I achieve it," she said.
"It's very military."

Like Bill Clinton, Royal is a true champion of the educational meritocracy.
In just such a manner does the Énarque convert intellectual capital into political fuel.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mitterand became if not quite Royal's mentor then certainly her role model.
According to Sophie Bouchet-Pedersen, then a colleague at Élysée and now one of Royal's policy advisers, "She learned from Mitterand how to govern, how politics must take primacy over technocracy; and then will — that in the end, politics is a matter of will."
He must have always had this inferiority complex of provincials who didn't sparkle in society.
She, too, was a provincial upstart with the will to sweep obstacles from her path; she could climb the hierarchy as the majestic Monsieur le Président had done.
At the same time that President Bill Clinton was clearing political space for the Democrats by advocating school uniforms and V-chips, Royal was instituting such modest and homey reforms as requiring separate copies of report cards to be sent to both parents, in order to ensure that fathers as well as mothers were engaged in their children's education.

Royal's crusades may actually have lowered her standing among her own colleagues; the books vanished without a trace.
And yet many French women recognized themselves, or an ideal self, in Ségolène.
Michèle Fitoussi, an editor at French Elle, remembers watching her at a luncheon: "She discusses policy, and then the mobile phone rings and it's her daughter, and she says, 'Yes, you have to go here and here.'
We deal with all these things at once."

And Royal had the raw ambition of the parvenu.
"Because Jospin can't stand her," she was told.
In 2004 she ran for president of Poitou-Charentes, a job previously held by Jean-Pierre Raffarin, then serving as prime minister under Chirac.
And again, confounding expectations, she won.
But to be president of the republic one must demonstrate gravitas, stoic endurance, global reach, celestial grandeur.
One should, if at all possible, as the journalist (and Royal's biographer) Daniel Bernard wrote earlier this year, quote "Huntington, Machiavelli, Baverez, Hegel, Jaurès, Sollers and Seneca."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
It was, in fact, a bizarre and very touchy situation.
Royal says that she would not have run against her partner, and in fact waited until it became clear that he would not be a candidate.
Party leaders were meeting in the Burgundian city of Nevers when the article appeared; Royal's brazen display of comeliness, of family and family values — in short, her ragingly successful politics of the self — made the elephants go berserk.
Laurent Fabius issued what must have seemed a wicked jape aimed at both Royal and Hollande: "But who's going to watch the kids?"
"The presidency is not a beauty contest," groused another party leader.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But Royal's strategy, as Daniel Bernard observed, consisted of betting that the French were sick of the culture of the old guard and the narrowness and sterility of its discourse.
She has behaved with calculated insouciance.
Royal's legend has grown apace.
Like Nicolas Sarkozy — minister of the interior, abrasive leader of the ruling Union for a Popular Movement and a likely presidential candidate — she would not toe the party line.
"I will guard my freedom of speech to the very end, come what may," she announced to yet another magazine reporter.
On her Web site, Désirs d'Avenir (Wishes for the Future), she invited visitors to express their views rather than offering pensées of her own.
But she could spit nails if she needed to.
When I asked Royal whether her success had blunted the attack from the left, she shot back: "It's getting worse, because they're afraid.
They've invested so many years themselves that they think my popularity is an imposture, ephemeral, unwarranted, undeserved, dangerous — as if a democracy of opinion is worth nothing."

It is the democracy of opinion that Royal is offering the French people.
She sent me the piece, which was called "The Democratic Disorder" and which barely touches on France's place in the world, the consuming preoccupation of her rivals' manifestoes.
Royal writes instead about the relationship of politicians to voters, arguing that diminishing turnout, the ominous popularity of the far-right-wing National Front and even the repudiation last year of the E.U.
Constitution are all symptoms of a deep national disaffection from, and disgust with, mainstream political culture.
These protest votes, or nonvotes, spring from citizens who are deeply pessimistic about their prospects, who feel that France is adrift.
She argues, in the manner of centrist Democrats courting red-state voters, that the "nostalgia for 'traditional values' " that many National Front voters cite is less a harbinger of protofascism than a rejection of value-neutral politics.
The answer, she claims, is a new kind of politics, respectful of public opinion, modest in its claims, transparent, accountable and, above all, "concrete" rather than abstract.
Her book, which is to appear in September, when the Socialists draw up their official list of candidates, is unlikely to narrow the gulf between Royal's popular following and her standing in the party's inner councils.
The French regard the protection of job security as a fundamental obligation of the state.
But France's unemployment rate, which has not gone below 8 percent for years and now hovers around 10 percent, is usually ascribed to the reluctance of firms to hire new workers whom it will find prohibitively burdensome and expensive to lay off.
Young people with only ordinary credentials, including a college degree, often find it extremely difficult to break into the labor market; unemployment among the young is estimated to be as high as 22 percent.
The employment system that has evolved in recent decades looks and feels very much like an American university, where junior faculty members scramble desperately to find a position, their passage upward blocked by the ponderous mass of tenured faculty, secure for life.
Responding in part to the riots that tore apart the country's suburbs the previous fall, Dominique de Villepin had introduced the "first employment contract," known in French as the C.P.E., in the hope of increasing employment opportunities for disadvantaged youth.
Workers under 26 holding their first full-time jobs would have, in effect, a probationary period of two years during which an employer could lay them off without having to endure the elaborate judicial process to which employees can otherwise resort.
Worse still, by presenting this immensely controversial measure as if he had received it from a whirlwind atop Mount Sinai, thus precluding all debate, the magisterial Villepin only confirmed the worst suspicions, which is to say that the center-right government was in league with "the bosses" to keep workers in a state of serfdom.
Revolution is the only form of political activity in France that feels fully legitimate; so even the deeply conservative demand for security takes the form of insurrection.
And the French still speak of "the bosses" as a class of bloodsuckers.
As Alain Touraine observes: "The main French idea is that there is an absolute contradiction between social good and economic interests.
Where else do you hear this, besides maybe Belarus?"
The historic destiny of the left is to use the power of the state to protect the people from the ravages of the marketplace; the loneliness of the endeavor only increases its nobility.
As Nicolas Domenach, a political commentator and an editor of the cheeky, leftish magazine Marianne, put it to me: "One could be arrogant, that is to say French, and say that someone must guard against the omnipotence of liberalism.
But I would argue that France is not the exception but rather the avant-garde.
If we talk again a year from now, you will see counterliberal movements across Europe."

Yet this sense of moral superiority, and the reflexive horror at the unleashed energies of the marketplace, have plainly been losing force as France's per capita wealth falls behind that of countries like Ireland and Britain.
Scholars and journalists routinely speak of a crisis, or a paralysis, gripping the country.
Gérard Grunberg, a leading scholar at Sciences Po, told me: "There is no liberal tradition on either the left or the right; there isn't even a place for a social-liberal party, because it would imply an acceptance of labor-market flexibility.
It would imply that the state isn't the sole guarantor of the collective interest, which is entrenched in French culture.
It is the state that embodies and guarantees the collective interests; the rest is selfish individualism."
And this antimarket, antiglobalist posture, Grunberg argues, "resounds among the people, because the people are afraid."

The Socialist Party, perhaps wisely, harvested the growing public outrage over the C.P.E.
without offering any alternative of its own.
As party head, François Hollande led the attack on Villepin and the ruling party.
Ségolène Royal kept mum, as she has done on almost all major subjects.
In early February, just as the debate over the labor law was heating up, she was quoted as saying: "I think Tony Blair has been caricatured in France.
It does not bother me to claim adherence to some of his ideas."
She even praised his policy of promoting employment among the youth through increased flexibility.
This was sacrilege: flexibilité is the fighting word of French employers, and thus the symbolic opposite of précarité.
Laurent Fabius, addressing a crowd of 1,200 supporters, declared that the Socialist Party would not succeed by "cultivating I-don't-know-what politically ambiguous position" — a reference meant to be lost on no one.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In fact, Royal seems innocent of any taint of economic liberalism.
She regards Villepin's peremptory imposition of the new law as a sign of a systematic failure to listen to ordinary people; but she does not view the national suspicion of market forces as a comparable source of paralysis.
Royal countered my observation with a familiar refrain: "The problem is that everybody isn't subject to insecurity.
Do you see businessmen being fired for incompetence?
The young see politicians, who also have a stable and secure job, being civil servants, lecturing others on insecurity.
So the young graduate will say, 'In the name of what am I going to sign an insecure contract?'
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Then the conversation took an odd turn.
Royal asked me, with the air of someone pulling out a trump card, "Are you in an insecure situation?"
Actually, I explained, as a contract writer for this magazine, I have little security.
Royal wasn't going to be put off the scent that easily.
"Yes, but how many years does your contract last?"
"I sign a new one every year."
"You could be fired every year?"
For all her own experience, Royal apparently viewed précarité as a kind of socioeconomic stigma rather than the price you might choose to pay for freedom.
Or maybe you could say that for her, as for the left generally — and not only in France — market liberalism and globalization have the status merely of fact, which is categorically inferior to a right.
This is no less so if the fact appears to obviate the right.
"The global economy shouldn't be supported by wage earners," Royal insisted.
"They have to be able to build a future, like any human being."
Royal is not actually opposed to labor-market reform; she advocates the model the Danes call flex-security, in which the state guarantees lifelong training, job placement and unemployment insurance, so that workers can easily move among jobs.
But since she is also on record as advocating giant public-works projects, she may be more devoted to the job insurance than the market-sensitive side of this approach.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Some of Royal's supporters take the optimistic view that her empiricism, her disdain for ideological litmus tests, will ultimately lead her away from the party's hermetic dogma.
One of her most celebrated and least likely advocates, Daniel Cohn-Bendit — Danny the Red, when he manned the barricades of 1968 — suggests just this possibility.
Cohn-Bendit, a leader of the Green Party and a rebel to the last, has outraged compatriots old and new by describing himself as a liberal.
Cohn-Bendit admits that he has no reason to believe that Royal shares his views, but he also feels, as did so many of the people I spoke to, that French politics has reached a dead end.
"You have to create a situation where you're ready to debate your proposition," Cohn-Bendit contends, "where you say, 'We together will decide to take this risk, because there is no easy solution.'
" Royal has, he says, the inner freedom to take this route.
What's more, he says, "To think of a president with four children and not married — it's a revolution!"
What about terrorism?
And Iraq?
Royal responded with a surprising question of her own: "Would you ask this of a man?"
"Of course I would."

I pointed out that she was, after all, hoping to be president of France.
"You're saying it's too early?"
Her smile vanished, and she said: "I refuse to be infantilized by being asked questions which imply that I know nothing, that I'm the result of a media bubble.
I haven't heard Fabius or Sarkozy explain their vision of the world and of interplanetary coherence."
This, too, has become part of the Ségolène legend.
Two weeks after our conversation, "Les Guignols," a popular television show that satirizes France's leading political and cultural figures, had a sketch featuring a puppet Ségolène.
An interviewer asks, "Are you truly a Socialist candidate?"
and Royal, her smile never faltering, shoots back, "You would never ask such a question of a man."
At lunch, the waiter suggests "an excellent sole," and she retorts, "You only recommend fish because I'm a woman, and you assume I have to watch what I eat."
And when she comes home to François, complaining about the obstacles she must clear as a female politician, her partner, ensconced in his reading chair, soothingly says, "Ah, Ségolène."
She cuts him off: "Would you call me Ségolène if I were a man?"
The French do, in fact, expect their president to cut an impressive figure at global meetings, and this weakness, if it is a weakness, will be mercilessly exploited by her rivals in the party, not to speak of those in the Union for a Popular Movement Party.
Has she thought seriously about international affairs, or European integration or the questions of identity and immigration that now beset France and all of Europe?
The paper trail is almost nonexistent.
These days she often gives the impression that "having views" is itself an expression of political arrogance.
She, by contrast, will tap the wisdom of the ordinary voter.
"The citizens are refined, cultivated and very political," she informed an interviewer who had accused her of abandoning political debate itself.
"I believe in the legitimacy of their participation."
Yes, but then what?
She's still listening, she says.
In fact, her advisers say that she won't stake out any positions before June, when the party platform, which she is helping to shape, will be published.
In the meantime, she fires off one round after another of thunderous blanks, vowing to deliver "just order" and "real equality" and "sustainable security."
It's all rather abstract for the candidate of concreteness.
But then, maybe what the French want is not a new set of views but, as Royal plainspokenly puts it on her Web site, "another way of doing politics."

The problem isn't the Democrats' inability to find a message.
It's the American public's inability to face up to the truth.
For a long time, truth tellers risked being framed and narrated out of the picture, with maybe a little ridicule and scorn thrown in for good effect.

Investors have been zigzagging between conflicting concerns that the economy is slowing more than expected because of the Fed tightening policy and that economic growth is still too strong to allow the central bank to stop raising rates.
"Certainly, good news is hopefully inflation starts to peter out a little bit or we've seen the high in commodities and it takes away some of the motivation for the Fed to raise rates," said Jay Suskind, co-head of capital markets at Ryan Beck & Company in Florham Park, N.J.

In the spring of 1999, Mr. Kremer and a group of like-minded independent farmers formed the Missouri Farmers Union "to protect and enhance the economic interest and way of life of family farmers and ranchers and the rural communities they represent," according to the mission statement.
All the members, including Mr. Kremer, adhere to strict protocols: animals must be fed a nutritious diet, free of additives; they must have access to the outdoors; and they must have shelter.
Before slaughter, the pigs are handled without stress to the point of electrical execution, which is strictly monitored.
"The hog feels no pain," said Mr. Kremer, who makes a weekly visit to the plant.
"And then he's dead."
This is the kind of value-added distinction that seems to make a difference to an increasing number of consumers who are interested in the food system, the whole process from farm to fork.

The co-op started to sell its products to regional supermarkets and local restaurants.
At Riddles Penultimate Cafe in St. Louis, the menu describes the source of its $18.50 pork loin (from the Ozark Mountain Pork Cooperative) as "the happy pigs."
Today, the co-op sells to Whole Foods Market; the restaurant chain Chipotle; the food supplier Sysco; and some of the best chefs in the country.
"It's a superior pork chop.
Such reviews are true validation for Mr. Kremer, proof that his efforts are paying off.
His day starts at 4:30 a.m., when he checks on his piglets and perhaps prepares some food.
He keeps accurate records of the feed that he mixes and grinds himself, does some office work on his laptop and checks his BlackBerry.
Then he sets off for the Missouri Farmers Union offices in Jefferson City, about 30 minutes from his farm.

There, he and his tiny staff work on five or six major projects at any given time, including the credit union and building marketing relationships for the pork co-op, as well as Mr. Kremer's activities as the only livestock farmer on Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns's Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st-Century Agriculture.

Of course, it was difficult for him to reconcile himself to the slaughter, but as he reasons: "Food is a part of life.
I know it seems like an oxymoron, but that's why humane handling, care and transport all the way to slaughter have always been important to me."
Mr. Kremer admits that he still names some of his hogs.
There is Petunia, Emma, Honeysuckle and "some more common pork names like Porky and Babe," he said.
He's happiest on his farm, with its two-bedroom house perched on a hillside.
"It's very quiet, and there's only one way to get there and one way to get out.

Last story.
I'm in gray Newark speaking to local businessmen.
I meet Andy Astor, chief executive of EnterpriseDB, which provides special features for the open-source database called PostgreSQL.
His primary development team, he tells me, consists of 60 Pakistani engineers in Islamabad, who interact with the New Jersey headquarters via Internet-based videoconferencing.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
"The New Jersey team — software architects, product managers and executives — comes to work a couple of hours early, while the Islamabad team comes in late, and we have at least five to six hours per day of overlap," Mr. Astor said.
"We therefore have multiple face-to-face meetings every day, which makes a huge difference for communication quality.
... We treat videoconference meetings as if we were all in the same room."
What all these stories tell me is that we are seeing the emergence of collaborative business models that were simply unimaginable a decade ago.
Today, there are so many more tools, so many more ideas, so many more people able to put these ideas and tools together to discover new things, and so much better communications to disseminate these new ideas across the globe.
If more countries can get just a few basic things right — enough telecom and bandwidth so their people can get connected; steadily improving education; decent, corruption-free economic governance; and the rule of law — and we can find more sources of clean energy, there is every reason for optimism that we could see even faster global growth in this century, with many more people lifted out of poverty.

After eight hours' paddling, we were happy to eat almost anything.
The anjoemara were absolutely fearless and spent their time randomly terrorizing anything slightly smaller than themselves.
Doing his wash next to the river one evening, Pieter saw a few circling close by.
Undaunted, the fish bit the end of his branch.
But their aggression was their downfall, as they would almost always have a go at one of our lures.
And what a fight!
To save our rods from being snapped, we resorted to very unsportsmanlike tactics.
As soon as a fish came near the shallows, I would wade in and hit it repeatedly with a wooden club.
I could have brained Mike Tyson — these fish were unbelievably resilient.

We smoked the fish over a campfire, the jungle's ubiquitous night sounds playing on our imaginations.
It was hard not to wonder what other, equally aggressive wildlife might be lurking out there.
As the protective flames slowly withered and we walked back to our hammocks and tents each night, I would sweep my head torch around in an arc through the bushes, crisscrossing the beam like a guard in a prison watchtower.
With the howler monkeys in mind, I would crash about, making as much noise as I could.
The night jungle is undoubtedly a scary place, but strangely, once I'd made it inside the hammock, I was somehow reassured by the paper-thin mosquito net.

"Is that a plane?"
Seconds later we were backpaddling furiously, trying to avoid being sucked into a monster rapid.

Pieter pushed off the rocks, just managing to prevent us from being dashed against them, but by the third drop, we were almost completely submerged.

There are times when ornithology is just plain dangerous.

These eels, which can produce shocks of up to 600 volts, can injure or even kill human beings.
The following five days passed with quiet, contemplative stretches followed by similar jolts of excitement.

Then suddenly, up ahead, a tapir splashed into the water, swimming with surprising agility up onto the bank.
Then, on the right bank, under an overhanging branch, something sandy in color moved with perfect feline grace.

Trivia poured out of them — anacondas allegedly smell terrible, tapirs are related to rhinos, a certain type of vine is pounded and used to stun fish.

A lowbred hodgepodge with the hydrodynamics of a potato, the makeshift vessel looked as if it would buckle on the first rapid.
However, looks, apparently, are not everything, and by this stage, it was only another 45 miles to the pickup point.
The remaining distance passed with mild rapids, and the lowbred coped surprisingly well.
Luxuries like beer and dry clothing were soon taken for granted, and we fed ourselves back up to our natural weight.
The mauled boats lay forlorn on the sandbanks — the only real casualties of our little expedition.
I have seen deserts, mountains and infinite quantities of ice, but the jungle is the only place where I seemed to stay in a constant state of amazement.
Such a rare profusion of life, diverse as it is and interacting on every level.
It could take a lifetime just to make the slightest sense of it all.

In addition, five of the six members of the compensation committee are active or former chief executives, including one whose compensation dwarfs Mr. Nardelli's.
Governance experts say people who are or have been in the top job have a harder time saying no to the salary demands of fellow chief executives.

To its critics, the panel exemplifies the close personal and professional ties among board members and executives at many companies — ties that can make it harder for a board to restrain executive pay.

"When you have a situation like this where it is so incestuous, it creates uncertainty whether Nardelli's pay is a reflection of these relationships or from his performance," said Jesse M. Fried, a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-author of a book on executive compensation, "Pay Without Performance."
A showdown could occur at the annual meeting tomorrow as firms that advise large shareholders and activist groups are urging shareholders to withhold votes from several directors.
The shareholder groups are also seeking the right to vote on the compensation committee's annual report and plan a rally outside the meeting in Wilmington, Del., to protest Mr. Nardelli's pay.

None of the current or former members of the compensation committee returned calls seeking comment, and the company would not make Mr. Nardelli available.

In an e-mail statement, Mr. Langone said: "Each and every board member at Home Depot is totally independent.
Candidates for service have been suggested and put through the nominating process by a wide variety of directors, myself included.
That is why there is such a diversity of thought, opinion and experience on the board and why our discussions are open, robust and objective."

Mr. Langone was instrumental in bringing the former G.E.
star into the company.
While he is not on the compensation committee, he has led the committee that nominates directors for the last seven years.
No stranger to controversy, Mr. Langone is currently under fire for his role as head of the compensation committee at the New York Stock Exchange, which granted the former chief executive Richard A. Grasso a pay package worth more than $140 million.
Mr. Grasso sat on Home Depot's board from 2002 to 2004, including a stint on the compensation committee.
"Arguably, Langone is the ringleader and the one who pulls the strings in this network," he added.
The attitude was one of 'we're all in this together,' " said Mr. Lapides, who has never worked at Home Depot but has studied the company for years.

Representatives of Mr. Marcus and Mr. Blank, both retired from Home Depot, said neither would comment for this article.
Since hiring Mr. Nardelli, 58, the board has awarded him more than $87 million in deferred stock grants and $90 million in stock options, according to an analysis by Brian Foley, a compensation consultant in White Plains.
Mr. Nardelli's salary, bonuses and a company loan make up most of the rest of his $245 million compensation.
The many connections among Home Depot's directors cause some critics to ask whether the nominating committee is failing in finding truly "independent" board members.
"The fact that you have so much overlapping boards here says to me: what was the nomination process to get on the board here, how wide was the net really cast?"
asked Eleanor Bloxham, president of the Value Alliance, a group that advises companies on corporate governance issues.

The net may not have been cast much farther than Mr. Langone's circle of friends and associates, critics say.
For instance, there is Bonnie G. Hill, who leads the Home Depot compensation committee.
The owner of a corporate-governance consulting firm, Ms. Hill is on the board of Yum Brands with Mr. Langone.
Until recently, she served on the board of ChoicePoint, another company with which Mr. Langone has deep ties, including serving as a director.
Mr. Langone's statement defending the ties of board members said the idea that they could not share friendships was ridiculous: "It not only sets up a make-believe standard but it is designed to please an agenda driven by activists with ulterior motives."

Ms. Hill is also on the compensation committee of Albertson's, the grocery chain, where she is determining the pay for the chief executive, Lawrence R. Johnston, who is also a Home Depot director.
"Would Johnston be as eager to promote strict pay practices on the Home Depot board, where one of his pay setters is in a position to apply the same pay principles to his own pay package?"
asked Jackie Cook, a senior research associate at the Corporate Library, an institutional advisory firm in Portland, Me.

Mr. Johnston was at G.E.
at the same time as Mr. Nardelli, running the appliances unit.
When it comes time for Mr. Nardelli to renegotiate his own contract, Mr. Johnston, as a member of the Home Depot compensation committee, is forced to negotiate against his own lawyer, said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.
"By utilizing the same legal counsel, if there's ever a dispute between the company and Mr. Nardelli over pay, it puts a member of the compensation committee in a very awkward position," Mr. Elson said.

More links to G.E.

The longtime chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, a unit of Kimberly-Clark, Mr. Gonzalez has known Mr. Langone and Mr. Nardelli for years as a G.E.
director.

This Year's 'Disney'
The ire of shareholder activists was raised even more with the addition of Mr. Mozilo to the board in February.
Mr. Mozilo now sits on the compensation committee.
His pay package, which is bigger than Mr. Nardelli's, already made him a target of governance groups.
Last year alone, Mr. Mozilo took home $70 million, including salary, bonus, stock options, payments for tax- and investment-advisory services and country club memberships.
"He's hardly likely to be an influence of restraint given his own pay package."
Shareholder activists are taking a more aggressive stance toward directors this year.
"Home Depot, I think, is the Disney of this shareholder season," said Mr. Ferlauto, referring to the 2004 annual meeting of Disney shareholders at which 45 percent of the votes cast were withheld from the chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, in part because of his pay.

At the Home Depot annual meeting tomorrow, several factions are recommending that investors withhold support from most of the directors.
The dissidents include A.F.S.C.M.E.

I.S.S.
claims there is a "disconnect" between Mr. Nardelli's pay and Home Depot's performance.
The board disagrees, saying that it based Mr. Nardelli's pay and bonus last year on the company's "outstanding operating performance," his "continuing success in developing a new foundation for long-term growth" and his "continuing superior leadership," according to a statement from the company.

Mr. Langone concurs.
"I have long felt that Bob Nardelli's abilities are absolutely first rate," he said in his statement.
"He's doing a great job and the strong fundamentals he has built during his tenure are proof of his keen leadership.
There are a whole variety of long-term indicators I find encouraging such as earnings growth, sales growth, equity value in the brand as well as systematic enhancements put in place companywide that have dramatically improved efficiency."
Yet, over the last five years, Home Depot stock has fallen 12 percent, performing worse than its peers and the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which fell 4 percent.

Today, two of Home Depot's four highest-paid executives hail from G.E., including its director of human resources.
In his latest moves, Mr. Nardelli is trying to retool Home Depot, snapping up lumber and building materials companies last year in order to push into the professional contractor market.
"He has made a big decision to get into the supply business, and Wall Street has greeted that decision with a yawn," said Eric Bosshard, a stock analyst at FTN Midwest Securities who does not own shares in the company.
The chief executive at the time, Mr. Blank, one of the co-founders, was actually on the hunt for a second-in-command, someone he could groom to take over his job eventually.

Mr. Langone, who sat on G.E.
2 position.
Worried he would go elsewhere, the Home Depot board decided Mr. Blank should step aside and Mr. Nardelli, who had no retail experience, should take his place.
Luring an executive of Mr. Nardelli's repute, however, came at a high price.

That was just the beginning.
He also received perks like use of a company plane for personal trips; a new car every three years, one similar in price to the Mercedes Benz S series; and a $10 million loan with an annual interest rate of 5.8 percent that would be forgiven over five years.
The target for Mr. Nardelli had been total shareholder return — share price increases plus reinvested dividends — compared with a peer group, and the company was performing poorly by that measure in 2003, according to the Corporate Library.
But that year, the board changed the target to one of growth in average diluted earnings per share, which takes into account the per share earnings decrease that occurs when stock options are awarded.
Other critics say the new hurdle is even easier to hit with a board-approved share-repurchase program.
Since 2002, the company has bought back nearly $10 billion of its own stock.

The one threat to Mr. Nardelli's pay is a proposal by A.F.S.C.M.E., the government workers' union, that would allow Home Depot shareholders to approve or reject the report from the compensation committee.
But even if the proposal is accepted, any future rejection of the board panel's compensation report would be merely symbolic.
The board can simply ignore shareholders and pay executives what they wish.
So far, similar proposals have been rejected at two other companies whose executive pay A.F.S.C.M.E.
identified as a problem: Merrill Lynch and U.S. Bancorp.
The Home Depot board is urging its shareholders to vote against the proposal.
Skepticism about Mr. Nardelli's strategy to move the company away from its retailing roots and concerns about a cooling in the housing market have caused some large investors to move out of the stock, said Michael E. Cox, a stock analyst at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, who does not personally own shares in the stock.
But like the majority of analysts on Wall Street, Mr. Cox recommends Home Depot's stock to investors because he believes that Mr. Nardelli's strategy will pay off in the long term for the company.

Furthermore, Mr. Nardelli's reputation has not been tarnished, insisted Gerard R. Roche, the high-profile recruiter who helped bring Mr. Nardelli to the retailer.
"I know he has been approached by other companies.
There are a number of people interested in lifting Nardelli out," Mr. Roche said.
"I can tell you there are a number of companies telling me to get them another Nardelli."
He gave them tuna fish, crackers and water, along with the free advice to go home and avoid the dangers of the desert — snakes, dehydration, dishonest smugglers, bandits and, of course, United States Border Patrol agents, who are armed.

Mr. Oropeza cannot arrest the migrants, or hold them for long, because they are breaking no Mexican law, unless he can prove they are paid guides.
"We explain to them what they are doing," he said.
"The intention, more than anything, is to convince them not to continue on their journey.
It's pretty hard."
The agents acknowledge they do little to stop the migrants on the Mexican side.
Indeed, they hand out literature containing tips on how to survive in the desert and what to do if apprehended in the United States.
They see their mission as saving lives, keeping people from dying in the desert.
"We are not helping them, we are orienting them," Mr. Oropeza said.
"But we cannot stop them, because they are in Mexico and this is a free country.
They can travel and walk where they like."

Having come hundreds of miles already, few migrants take the advice to turn around.
Most have paid smugglers as much as $1,500 to get them safely to the other side, agents said.

At dawn, Mr. Oropeza and two other agents discover 22 people hiding in some desert brush near the border.
The migrants are dressed in jeans and sweatshirts and carry backpacks and plastic bags with extra clothes, like school children on a field trip.

The migrants do not run, but obediently follow the agent's instructions.
They sit down in the desert sand and give their names, ages and home states to one agent.

On the way back to San Luis Rio Colorado, Mr. Oropeza pointed out a group of about a dozen migrants slipping through a recently built barrier designed to keep four-wheel-drive trucks from racing across the desert into the States.

Back at Grupo Beta's office in San Luis, Mr. Oropeza interviews an 19-year-old man in a bright orange T-shirt and cap, Modesto Mendosa, whom he suspects of being a guide because he has been caught two days in a row, once with a cellphone.
Every month the agents snare a few guides, or coyotes.
The hardest part of the job is spotting them among the regular migrants, Mr. Oropeza says.
Guiding people across the desert has become a kind of industry in border towns, even though the guides face 6 to 12 years in jail.

Outside the office, one of the migrants picked up, Margarito Ortega, 42, says he has had enough and is going back to his home in Michoacán, where he cuts sugar cane for $54 a week.
He says he has spent a week hiding in the trees and trying to slip through to the other side.
He is tired and has a bad cough.
Mr. Ortega has two homes.

Investors, who have been jumpy over even the slightest sign of inflation, responded by igniting a rally in stocks.
Given the Federal Reserve's focus on inflation in its deliberations on interest rates, the markets have responded lately with a high degree of volatility every time inflation fears rise or subside.
That is the fastest rate of growth since 2003.
Still, many expected a growth rate of 5.8 percent, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg News.
Consumer spending, which accounts for the bulk of the gross domestic product, contributed 3.63 percentage points to the overall 5.8 percent growth.

Just how big is shown in the accompanying charts.
United States Treasury data, as compiled by Bank of America, indicates that Americans put nearly $12 billion into Indian securities last year, far more than in any previous year.
Joseph Quinlan, the chief market strategist, notes that in the past developing markets have tended to plunge after big increases in American purchases.
Moreover, the chart shows that the Indian stock market's rise since late 2001 is similar to the run-up in the Nasdaq composite to its peak in 2000, although the decline since the high has been a little more rapid.
He also blamed margin calls for forcing some speculators to sell.
"The secular rise in India in the last two years is attributable to the sound India growth story," he said.
"The India growth story remains intact."
"I have a certain affection for Route 206," said Michael Aaron Rockland, a professor of American studies at Rutgers University, who with a colleague, Angus K. Gillespie, wrote, "Looking for America on the New Jersey Turnpike."
"I have a feeling about Route 206.
It is kind and sweet.
It winds through the state and, let's face it, any winding road has a personality that a straight Interstate can't possibly have."

Route 206 is a microcosm of all that is New Jersey.
Along some stretches the road is a kaleidoscope of strip malls, at other times it is far more rural, with farms and fences and the occasional old store that looks as if it has been there since the Depression.
It also runs through Trenton and Princeton, the oldest of New Jersey's towns, as well as the new exurbia in places like Montgomery Township, with the requisite diners and farm markets, industrial parks and county seats along the way.
At Milepost 18 — the mileage accrues as the road heads north — where Route 206 crosses Route 70, is the Red Lion Circle, one of the few roundabouts left in a state that was once famous — or perhaps infamous — for them.
Nearby are the Red Lion Motel, the Red Lion Diner and Red Lion Plaza.

The curious story behind the name Red Lion, according to one of the state's great storytellers, Henry Charlton Beck, in his book "Forgotten Towns of Southern New Jersey," is that one day, perhaps in the 18th century, a landowner named Parks came up against a mountain lion while hunting for bear.

As the road winds its way up the length of the state, it alternates between two lanes and four, especially in the more-rural areas.
For instance, at the Ro-Ann Farm in Vincentown, where the sign exhorts, "Hay for Sale," Route 206 widens from two lanes to four, then passes such businesses as the Little Mexico Mexican grocery and the Puppy Barn before narrowing once again.

At Milepost 29 in a Burlington County there is a landmark of sorts that has been there since the 1920's, the Columbus Farmers Market, which in its first few decades truly was a farmer's market.
"They would come with their wagons and trucks and trade animals and hay and corn," said Frank Bendi, the manager of the market, who is part of a group that has owned the market since 1990.
The market itself is a series of buildings, tents and stalls, giving it the appearance of a county fair from the side of the road.

"People come here to look around and buy stuff, if you know what I mean," Mr. Bendi said.
"It's a real family-oriented place, old-time like that."

The market is open Thursday through Sunday, and vendors open for business as early as 5:30 a.m. and stay until about 8 p.m., offering everything from tchotchkes to fresh produce.
Then, only five miles away in Bordentown, a new civilization beckons.
A series of chain motels — Best Western, Ramada Inn, Days Inn — are clustered at the intersection of Route 206 and I-195 and, not far from that, Exit 7 of the New Jersey Turnpike.

Professor Rockland recalled a time when, not far from the intersection, an oddball character would set up shop.
"There were strange machines and a locomotive painted white, as I remember.
In a way, it's sad he's not there any more.

Route 206 then goes through its urban phase as it continues its march north through Bordentown, Yardville and Trenton before becoming the main drag in Lawrenceville, separating the posh Lawrenceville School from the trendy shops on the west side of the road.
A mile or so out of town, at Milepost 49, is the Cherry Grove Farm, oddly tucked between Princeton and Trenton — which raises organically fed cattle, sheep and pigs.

"On the one hand, yes, it is strange to be doing this three miles from Princeton and five miles from Trenton, but on the other hand, no, it isn't," said Keith Harding, the manager of Cherry Grove Farm.
"It is a good place to be because we have an educated consumer base looking for this type of product, and they can get it straight from here."

What that means, he said, is that the cattle and sheep are fed only natural grasses, with no animal byproducts, and that he does not give the animals antibiotics or hormones.
As for the pigs, he said the ones he raises are heirloom pork, an old-fashioned breed.
"People do come in here thinking we are a normal farm stand, selling vegetables and fruits," he said.
"But when they see what we have, they are amazed we are here and often become repeat customers."

He didn't say whether anyone from Drumthwacket, the governor's mansion three miles up the road, comes to buy steaks or chops.

Drumthwacket, by the way, sits amid a five-mile stretch of Route 206 that is dotted by historical sites: the house where the German writer Thomas Mann lived in Princeton, and Morven, the 18th-century house that served as the governor's mansion from 1945 to 1981.

Then, in the shifting landscape that defines this road, Route 206 leaves the tweedy gentility of Lawrenceville and Princeton and heads north into Montgomery Township, which according to the Census Bureau is one of the fastest-growing municipalities in the Northeast with a population that has soared to 22,287 in 2004 from 9,612 in 1990.
Just across from the Princeton Airport is a series of faceless offices, high-tech companies like Bloomberg and Computer Associates and strip malls.
Yet just when one thinks this part of New Jersey has surrendered to the sameness of sprawl, there is a reminder of the road's past at Milepost 61: the Harlingen Garage, whose sign reads, "Family owned and operated since 1947."
"It is getting more congested here, but that's why you want to be on a road like 206."
At Milepost 80, Route 206 sprouts a sign with the patrician-sounding town of Peapack-Gladstone.
Not surprisingly, about a mile up the road is the headquarters of the United States Equestrian Team.

Then abruptly for three miles, from Mileposts 95 to 98, Route 206 becomes one with Interstate 80, which to some is simply wrong.
"If I am going on a road trip, I want a road with character, not an Interstate," Professor Rockland said.
"Most of U.S. 206 affords me that, fortunately."

But soon enough, it's back in the slow lane.
Just off Route 206 at Lackawanna Drive in Netcong, at Milepost 99, is Wild West City, which is about as odd and homespun as New Jersey gets.
The 50-year-old amusement park is a non-Disneyesque Western town with a Main Street that features, among other things, a blacksmith's shop and post office.
Wagons and a miniature train pull visitors around the grounds as cowboys wave and saunter about.
Every so often, the cowboys stage a shootout or a holdup on the dusty streets.
At Milepost 109, the road veers into downtown Newton, the seat of Sussex County.
The center square, which Route 206 wraps around, could be in Minnesota or Iowa, with its brick buildings and county courthouse.
A few hundred yards out of town, there is a John Deere dealer.

But in this rural and somewhat remote part of the state, the changes are unmistakable.
Hard by the John Deere tractors are large shopping centers with a Marshall's, a Wal-Mart, a Home Depot and a Sleepy's.

After a few more miles of this new brand of exurban commercialism, trees once again line the road as it approaches the final miles of Route 206.
There is Fairview Lake, a Y.M.C.A.
camp, some modest resorts and the Sussex County Fairgrounds.
Finally, Route 206 enters the township of Montague — which calls itself "The Top of New Jersey" because it is wedged in the northwest corner of New Jersey, where it meets New York and Pennsylvania — and ends on a bridge over the Delaware River, morphing into Route 6.
"It is one of New Jersey's personal roads," Professor Rockland said.
"When our sap is rising in the spring, we want to take a drive where there is a mixture of roadside stuff.
Route 206, at least for now, is one of those places to salve that."

What the food wars seem to reflect more than anything is our ambivalence about eating and about our bodies.
What they will do, I am afraid, is create even more anxiety around feeding our children and ourselves — anxiety that will, in turn, make it harder for all of us to be "joyful and competent with eating," in the words of Ellyn Satter, the author of "Your Child's Weight: Helping Without Harming" and a nationally recognized nutrition expert.
Besides, like other misguided public health campaigns (remember "Just Say No"?
), putting children on de facto diets at school just doesn't work.
Compared with students having no special program, the active, lower-fat group showed no differences in body weight or fat, or in levels of total cholesterol, insulin or glucose after two years.

Big surprise.
Anyone who's dieted for a day, a week, a month and then overeaten to compensate is familiar with the deprivation-binge-deprivation cycle — and with the weight gain that often accompanies it.

Early in my children's lives, I was a no-sugar, no-fat mom, the legacy of my own childhood with a constantly dieting mother.
With sprinkles.
And chocolate chips.
And gummy worms.
By rigidly restricting their sugar intake, I had made it a highly sought out pleasure — the last thing I'd intended.
Ms. Satter recommends giving children regular access to treats, at school and at home, by including those foods with more nutritious choices at meals and snacks.
"Avoid either extreme of forbidding snack-type food or letting children graze on them," she says.
"In the long run, this makes children eat more, not less."

What worries me even more than the words being thrown about in the food wars are the unspoken messages we're giving our children about their bodies, themselves and the food they eat.
Prohibiting that second slice of pizza sends a message that pizza is bad, that there are good foods and bad foods, safe foods and dangerous foods — a perceived dichotomy that every anorexic is all too familiar with.
I can hear the howls of outrage, imagine the letters I will get as a result of saying this.
But I will say it anyway: We have nothing to fear but fear itself.
That is, our twin fears of fat and food, and the consequent distortions in the way we feed ourselves and our children, will damage us far more than a bowl of ice cream every now and again.
"Emphasize providing, not depriving," Ms. Satter suggests.
"Maintain the structure of meals and snacks so children can count on getting fed — and fed enough."
So serve another slice of pizza.
Bring on the chocolate cupcakes.
Dish up the broccoli soup and burritos, the strawberries and cheesecake.
Give kids more time to run around and play, and also more time to eat.
Teach them about the joys of food, not the terrors.
And maybe they'll grow up less ambivalent and healthier than we are.

Adding to the anxiety on Wall Street yesterday, Michael H. Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, expressed concerns in an interview that inflation was running a little too high.
His remarks, broadcast on CNBC, raised fears that the central bank could raise interest rates for a 17th consecutive time when it meets next month.
One issue distressing investors, analysts said, is that they can no longer predict with any degree of certainty what the Fed will do.
"The bottom line is investors don't like uncertainty," said Michael Pond, an interest rate strategist with Barclays Capital.
"You're entering into the first meeting in a year and a half where it's not clear whether the Fed is going to raise interest rates.
But the Fed doesn't know what they're going to do, and investors should be concerned about that."

Analysts also point out that market downturns are symptomatic of an economy that is cooling.
"Until the stock market can feel comfortable that this is going to be a modest inflation pickup," Mr. Harris of Lehman said, "investors are going to be worried.
So it's understandable that there's some repricing going on."

Just three weeks ago, the Dow Jones industrial average looked as if it might break its record high.
Since then, stocks have been moving at a volatile clip, dropping sharply, then rising, but ultimately erasing the gains made earlier in the month.
The Dow is now down 4.7 percent from its closing high on May 10.

William Rhodes, chief investment strategist with Rhodes Analytics, said the recent decline could be chalked up to the market correcting itself.
"It certainly is a correction, and a correction that is timed against reaching that peak," Mr. Rhodes said.

Since this is Furst territory, Carlo often receives certain other kinds of offers as well.
"There had always been, in her demeanor, a night visit on the horizon," the book says of one woman.
But she would have to wait her turn, since Carlo's nighttime hours are already well accounted for.
Mr. Furst manages the sleight-of-hand of making Carlo lonely enough to linger in humdrum French hangouts ("his little haunts, Mère this and Chez that") while also involving him in romances of varying temperatures.

One is merely convenient, "a very pallid love affair."

Although Christa's fate, and her role in underground resistance in Berlin, become pivotally important to "The Foreign Correspondent," the book casts a much wider net than that might suggest.
It gives Carlo a close view of journalism.
From his Reuters editor: "Can you do it?
Ride on trains and mule carts and whatnot and get us the story?
With emotion?
With a feel for the human side, for the prime minister at his grand desk and the peasant on his little patch of earth?"

It gives him entrée into the spy world that comes with his professional territory.
"The spies were always after something," Mr. Furst writes.
Since "The Foreign Correspondent" is a kind of crossroads book for Mr. Furst, it also makes glancing contact with some of the most wonderfully devious such figures from his earlier novels.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Throughout this story Carlo struggles to keep Liberazione afloat (Italians abroad produced more than 500 such journals, by Mr. Furst's estimate) and exerts a subtle but palpable influence on history.
Sometimes he is a pawn, and knows it, as when he is fed information by propaganda ministries.
Sometimes he has the chance to be actively subversive.
Sometimes he is enlisted to ghostwrite tales of heroism.
(One of the book's most haunting figures is a hero of the Spanish Civil War, whose legend Carlo is asked to promote and homogenize.)
And sometimes he is best suited to watching events unfold with Mr. Furst's own keen, jaundiced eye.
Hearing the Spanish situation addressed at a meeting in Paris of the International Association of Writers, among them Theodore Dreiser and Langston Hughes, he notes a survey showing "that 410 of the 418 members favored the Republican side."
In addition, there was "a notable absence of Russian writers at the conference, as they were busy mining gold in Siberia or being shot in the Lubyanka."
Carlo knows that he cannot publish such thoughts.
But he must find covert ways — and here is where the true suspense of "The Foreign Correspondent" lies — of making sure that they find their way to the wider world.
Also from Mr. Sheeler's early years are examples from a celebrated 1917 series of photographs that he shot inside an old house in Doylestown, Pa., that he rented in the teens and 20's.
Formally exacting pictures of a backlighted wood stove in an empty white room, and of a rustic wooden door open to reveal a narrow flight of stairs, make it clear that Mr. Sheeler considered himself as much a photographer as a painter when he was starting out.
So does the 1927 series of photographs made on assignment for the Ford Company, documenting a huge new car-making factory in River Rouge, Mich.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But Mr. Sheeler's handmade versions of images from both series also prove that there was something he could achieve in painting and drawing that he could not in photography.
These works enlarge and subtly flatten and simplify the photographic images, enhancing their abstract qualities but also making them more luminous, mysterious and even visionary.
The last part of the exhibition presents paintings, drawings and small studies that are based on double- and triple-exposed photographs of old mills in New England, all from the 1940's and 50's.
Printed without much fuss, these photographs served mainly as studies for his drawings and paintings that elegantly blend Cubist fragmentation, Surrealistic montage and American Scene painting.
Photo
What emerges from all this is something more than the image of a technically inventive and versatile artist.
Yet his paintings are not without feeling, contrary to the criticism in his day that found him cold.
His works often exude melancholic, nostalgic moods.
Some could be cousins of Hopper's lonesome paintings.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
What, if any, personal sources fed those feelings is hard to say; Mr. Sheeler doesn't tip his hand.
One of his most famous pictures, included in the exhibition, is the black-and-white drawing of a telephone on a windowsill with Mr. Sheeler himself reflected from the neck down in the dark window pane: it's a picture of a lonely guy waiting for someone to call, a man too reticent to reach out.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Biographical speculations aside, what is remarkable about Mr. Sheeler's art is that images representing the epitome of American vitality should turn out so mournful and even, in some cases, funereal.
See, for example, "Classic Landscape" (1931), a depiction of gravel piles, railroad tracks and severely geometric industrial buildings under a leaden sky, based on one of the River Rouge photographs.
It is as if he is saying that beneath the frantic busyness of American capitalism there is a terrible grief over the loss of a more humane way of life.
Now, almost 60 years later, after the triumph of Pop Art, the rise of photography and the decline of an unquestioning faith in America, domestically and globally, he looks like a prophet.
Made with cool wit and mechanical precision, yet exuding feelings of abandonment and sadness, they could be postmodernist homages to Mr. Sheeler's elegiac Modernism.

More skittish trading is expected next week, which will bring only a handful of economic reports that bear little importance for the inflation picture.

"The clear slowdown in housing and indications of less consumer strength from Wal-Mart, those are showing that there are some risks here," said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist for the PNC Financial Services Group.
"We're probably going to see more volatility in this data-dependent market until we can get past the summer."
Wall Street had little reaction to an expected drop in April factory orders, which backed views that demand is easing with economic growth.
Orders retreated 1.8 percent after climbing 4.2 percent the previous month.
Pulte Homes sharply cut its projected full-year earnings, citing a steep drop in orders for April and May because of greater inventory and rising mortgage rates.
"Developers probably have my picture on a dartboard and are throwing darts at it all day long," Mr. Avella said, "but the reaction from residents has been overwhelmingly positive."
In 1992, Mr. Carpentiere, who is known as Pat, and his wife, Geraldine, paid $380,000 for a semiattached vinyl-sided colonial, with three bedrooms, one and a half baths and a backyard.

Three of the Carpentieres' children — Pat, Lisa and Donna — have their own homes in Whitestone now, all within five minutes' drive of their parents' home.

What You'll Find
Spread out like a fan between the Bronx-Whitestone and the Throgs Neck Bridges, Whitestone's four square miles encompass a number of smaller named sections and a diverse stock of homes.
Detached single-family Tudors, ranches and Capes, built on the sites of former farms and summer resorts and typically made of brick, they have modest backyards and well-tended lawns, and are close to the street.

As in earlier generations, these homes usually appeal to buyers looking to leave apartments in built-up parts of Queens for more room and more open space, according to Anthony Carollo, the owner of Carollo Real Estate, who has been selling houses in Whitestone for eight years.

"It's congested in Astoria," Mr. Carollo said, "because developers can knock down a house and build a 20-story condominium complex next to it.
There's also a lot of commercial development, making it a little Manhattan."
But for all the midcentury homes in Whitestone, there is also older housing stock.

A few from the 19th century, set back from the street with wide porches, can be found along 150th Street, north of the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Church, and older Dutch colonials and shingle-style houses line sections of 20th Avenue, another desirable street.
In addition to seeking teardown possibilities, developers have turned their attention in recent years to East River sites like the former Catholic Youth Organization camp on Whitestone Point.
Renamed Waterside Estates at Cresthaven, it now has 50 or so single-family homes, many with water views and boat moorings.

Whitestone's shopping district, clustered around 150th Street and 14th Avenue, looks practically Rockwellian, with an old-fashioned chemist and a music shop, as well as a tavern tucked inside an old bank.
In the 2000 census, more than 30 percent of the people living in the Whitestone area claimed Italian ancestry, and some businesses have names to back this up, like the Corona Park Pork Store, Villagio Restaurant, and Irene and Sal's.
Most restaurants close at midnight, when Whitestone's streets grow silent.
The Schools

Roman Catholic schools are also a popular option.
Three schools in the general area run from prekindergarten through Grade 8, though St. Luke's, on 150th Place, is the only one in Whitestone proper.

Among those younger women, the breast cancer death rate in blacks is 11 per 100,000, compared with only 6.3 in whites.

The new data about tumor types is not the whole story, researchers say, because some of the disparity may also result from a lack of access to health care among blacks or differences in nutrition, personal habits or environmental exposures.
The genetic discovery is "somewhat alarming," but also a "good thing," because it exposes details about the cancer that should help doctors identify specific drugs to fight it, said the study's main author, Dr. Lisa A. Carey, the medical director of the University of North Carolina-Lineberger breast center.
Several research groups including her own have already begun testing new drugs against this type of breast cancer, Dr. Carey said.
The work involves finding drugs to block specific molecules that these tumors need to grow.
If the trials succeed, new treatments could be available within a few years, perhaps even as soon as a year from now, she predicted.

These tumors are identified not by looking through a microscope, but by special tests that measure patterns of genetic activity.

Basal-like tumors tend to grow fast and spread quickly, and they are more likely than other types to be fatal.
They are not fed by the hormone estrogen, and so cannot be treated or prevented with estrogen-blocking drugs like tamoxifen or raloxifene.
Herceptin, another breast cancer drug, is also useless against these tumors.
The tumors are not stimulated by the hormone progesterone, either.
For that reason, cancer specialists call them "triple negative."

The goal is to find particular molecules in a cell that drive proliferation or tumor survival, and to block them.

Newer cancer drugs like herceptin and Gleevec, which is used for certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors, work in this so-called targeted fashion, and so does Tykerb, a new breast cancer drug described last weekend at a meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology.

Breast cancer experts hope to find better treatments than chemotherapy for many types of the cancer, and Dr. Carey said, "That's the challenge, getting away from chemo for this subtype."

Lower rates could hurt the dollar, but also strengthen the economy.
His best hope may be that the conundrum cited by his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, will keep operating but in reverse, as a halt to rising short-term rates leads to dollar weakness and to rising long-term rates as foreigners show less eagerness to buy Treasury bills and notes.
Flexibility may be essential.
"If Bernanke commits categorically to a response to core price pressures," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of ITG, "he could find himself raising rates because housing does worse because of the arithmetic of how that plays out in the C.P.I."
Mr. Bernanke may come to understand why Mr. Greenspan so rarely said anything clearly.
Huh?
WHAT is naked short selling?
Typically, when someone wants to sell a stock short — that is, make a bet that the price will go down — he is required to borrow the stock from someone else, usually a brokerage firm.
Assuming the price drops as the short seller hopes, he then buys the stock at the lower price and pockets the difference as his profit.
Here, by contrast, is how the S.E.C.
describes naked short selling on its Web site: "In a 'naked' short sale, the seller does not borrow or arrange to borrow the securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period.
As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due (known as a 'failure to deliver' or 'fail')."

Sounds pretty technical, right?
And for the most part, it is.
The S.E.C.
goes on to say that there are often legitimate reasons for a "failure to deliver" and that in some circumstances naked short selling isn't even necessarily a violation of the agency's rules.
But it can be an abusive practice.
To better monitor naked short selling — and try to lower the number of "failures to deliver" — early last year the S.E.C.
instituted something called Regulation SHO, which compiles what the agency calls a "threshold" list of companies in which there are more than 10,000 shares that have "failed to deliver" in the allotted time.
Overstock has been on the threshold list pretty much ever since Reg SHO came into being.
Which, to Mr. Byrne — though to virtually no one else — means that shadowy, bad people, who lurk in the darkest corners of Wall Street, are breaking the law and creating "phantom shares" of the stock through the practice of naked shorting.
Indeed, his lawsuit against Rocker Partners has nothing at all to do with naked short selling.
(Rocker Partners and Gradient are aggressively defending against the Overstock lawsuit.)
Rather, he portrays himself as a Don Quixote-like figure, fighting to rid Wall Street of "criminals" — a word he used frequently during our short interview.
(He asked if he could tape our conversation, so I'm confident you'll be able to read it soon on the Internet.
That has become one of Mr. Byrne's favorite tactics.)

"Right now," he said, "people in certain hedge funds are being scofflaws and the S.E.C.
is giving hall passes to criminals" — by not making public the names of the institutions that have persistent "fails" beyond the allotted time frame, information he believes should be in the public domain.
In fact, the S.E.C.
has no intention of releasing such information, precisely because the agency fears that it might cause the companies on the list to seek retribution.

Mr. Byrne says that firms and hedge funds that consistently fail to deliver are in violation of the law and that the rampant abuses are creating "systemic risk," generating millions of "phantom shares," destroying small-cap companies and robbing small investors who are getting, as he puts it, "I.O.U.
's" instead of real shares.
Before our conversation ended, he tossed me one of his favorite lines: "Somewhere in America, a grandma is eating dog food tonight because these people are looting the savings of America."

If you find this all a little hard to take seriously, join the crowd.
Grandmas are eating dog food because of a "failure to deliver?"
Really?
Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most people who understand the issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus.
Apparently, though, that doesn't bother Utah's legislators and its governor.
Not exactly.
As it happens, one of Mr. Foxley's clients is Overstock.com.
According to The Deseret News, Mr. Byrne is also the largest individual political donor in the state, whose contributions include $75,000 toward the 2004 gubernatorial campaign of Governor Huntsman.

So what will the new law do?
According to The Deseret News, it will require sellers involved in "failure to deliver" transactions "to report to the Utah Division of Securities and reveal the identities of all parties, including dates, locations and prices involved in the sales."
In other words, Mr. Byrne is hoping to use the state regulatory apparatus to pry out the information the S.E.C.
won't supply.
The state will also have the ability to set daily fines starting at $10,000 a day for brokers that don't comply with the new state rules about disclosure, and companies will also be able to sue for damages.
I should add that the law applies only to the stocks of Utah-based companies — but every broker-dealer in the country would have to comply with it.
"Our future as a state consists of companies that are just getting off the ground," he said.
"For me, this was a means of enhancing our attractiveness to these kinds of companies, by making the playing field a little more transparent, a little more fair.
This is an issue that is important to many of them."

I don't really think the practical effect of the new law is going to lead to a surge of hungry, shackled entrepreneurs moving to Provo, though.
The Securities Industry Association, the big Wall Street lobby, is up in arms about the new law, and will undoubtedly sue on the grounds that Utah is trying to pre-empt federal securities law and impose an operational requirement that it simply doesn't have the right to impose.
I'm putting my money on the association.
Another possibility, which the securities lobby pointed out in a letter to the governor, is that Wall Street firms would just stop trading in the stocks of Utah-based companies.
"Limiting interaction with Utah companies could make trading in such companies illiquid and negatively impact the ability of companies to raise capital necessary to grow and prosper," it said in the letter.
Twenty-five years ago, the state of Utah made a concerted — and quite foolish — legislative effort to impose its will on Wall Street.

I am better off financially and willing to ignore this debt to me (half of $2,000), but he would be very unhappy if he found out and would want to repay it.
Am I being unethical by withholding this information?
Anonymous
Your concern for your brother is admirable; the way you propose to show it is less so.
You should respect not only his finances but his feelings, and you know what those are: he would be "very unhappy" if he learned that you were withholding this information.
Therefore you should tell him about the i.o.u., treating it like the minor matter it is.
When you do, mention your willingness to waive the debt, or perhaps, to soften the blow, offer to spread out his payments over several years.
I'm wary of keeping secrets for what we imagine to be someone else's own good.
It is condescending to assume that we can handle what he or she cannot.
You need not blurt out every passing thought.
(What a hideous haircut!
Look away, children, look away!)
We legitimately enjoy the privacy of our own minds.
But there is information, even unsettling information, that other people have a right to.
(That's why I told my imaginary grandmother about the results of the last election.)
There is also a legal consideration.
If you are your mother's executor and there are other beneficiaries, you may have a duty to disclose this debt; check with a lawyer about that.
But in any case, do not deprive your brother of a chance to be an adult.
I will repay the loans in full, but must I begin paying sooner than instructed?

There are a couple of ways you might analyze this situation, and both leave you in the clear.
In ethics, intent counts, and yours is honorable.
You provided accurate information and are not trying to profit by manipulating the repayment schedule.
Actions can also be scrutinized for their anticipated consequences, and yours are unlikely to do harm.
Deferring your repayment means extending the duration of the loan, providing more interest and greater profit to the lender.
While interest rates may vary over this extended payback period, it's unclear whether this will hurt the lender: nobody knows whether rates will rise or fall.
Investors are facing a number of new developments that are making risky investments, particularly those in emerging overseas markets, look like a bad idea, economists say.
First, the United States economy by most accounts is beginning to downshift to a less rapid period of growth.
Second, higher interest rates are making consumers think twice about how to spend their money.

"This has been a very powerful liquidity-driven market that has drawn a lot of support from low interest rates," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.
"And investors are coming to the realization that the Fed is taking the candy away.
They have to come down to earth."
Adding to the market anxiety is the widespread belief that the Federal Reserve, which has said inflation is rising at an uncomfortable rate, will raise interest rates yet again when it meets later this month.
"Market participants have been forced to think about, 'Will the Fed overdo it?'
"Investors are responding as they do.
They're pulling in."

Investors are also adjusting to the ideology of a new Fed chairman.
Since Ben S. Bernanke took the reins of the central bank in February, investors have struggled to discern how tough Mr. Bernanke will be in fighting inflation.
On the one hand, raising interest rates too much could squelch economic growth.
But at the same time, Mr. Bernanke has said that inflation is a top concern of the Federal Reserve.

A major question facing investors is what will Mr. Bernanke think is a bigger risk to the economy: rising inflation or slowing growth.

This week, the government is set to release several reports measuring economic activity, including retail sales and the federal budget deficit.
But the most closely watched will be the Consumer Price Index, the government's major barometer of inflation.
If the numbers show too much of an acceleration, that could make already-jumpy investors nervous that the expected June interest rate increase could go as high as a half-point.
Most would agree that the global economy is not in any immediate danger of faltering and that the stock market so far shows no signs that it is headed toward a protracted slump.
"The fundamentals of the world economy are still O.K.," Mr. Roach, of Morgan Stanley, said.
"They're not terrific, but still O.K."
Mark Cliffe, global head of financial markets research at ING Group in London, said: "So far, the fact that the U.S. market has fallen by 5 or 6 percent from the peak is hardly catastrophic.
But if it starts to fall another 5 percent, it could have some meaningful impact, for example, on consumer spending.
Joe Six-Pack could start to cut back his stock portfolio."

Moreover, experts say that if investors were truly worried about the American economy slowing too rapidly, they would be pushing bond prices higher, seeking a safer investment.
That has not yet happened on a broad scale.
Questions about the strength of the global economy were on the minds of the Group of 8's leaders this weekend, who offered an assurance that growth is healthy but the world's economies remain vulnerable to erratic market forces like oil prices.
"Global growth remains strong and is gradually becoming more broadly based," finance ministers from the eight nations, including Russia, the United States and Germany, said in a statement.
"However, downside risks from high and volatile energy prices and widening global imbalances remain."

"The technology seems to change every Monday," said Bob Chapek, the president of Buena Vista Home Entertainment, a division of Disney, speaking on a panel of studio chiefs.

For the studios, the clock is ticking: sales of standard discs are expected to fall by about 20 percent by 2010, according to Adams Media Research, an industry consultant based in Carmel, Calif.
With most movies and many television shows now on DVD, studios are running out of new material to throw at consumers, analysts say.
Some studios have been repackaging older hits into anniversary box sets and other promotions, but consumers may be tiring of that tactic, as studio chiefs sheepishly acknowledge.
"We would release special editions as long as people would buy them."

Movie studios have also been issuing DVD's closer to movie release dates.
This has led to larger spikes in sales right after DVD's come out, but steeper declines later and more turnover on store shelves.
For movies that gross more than $100 million at the box office, 84 percent of DVD sales are in the first six weeks after their release, up from 81 percent in 2003, according to David Hoffman, an analyst for Nielsen VideoScan.

Some of the slowdown, though, is beyond the studios' control.
A growing number of Americans with digital cable plans, for instance, are now watching movies on demand and buying or renting fewer DVD's.

Comcast, the country's largest cable company, lets its subscribers view 7,500 free movies and programs, and since 2004, they have watched them two billion times.
While this has made it easier for Americans to avoid driving to the mall to buy DVD's, they are still renting them.
Netflix, a mail-order service that stocks about 60,000 DVD's of movies, TV shows and other fare, has about five million customers.
Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, expects to have 20 million customers by 2012.
He says his business is helped by the exclusive licensing deals that restrict the selection of movies available via Internet downloading and video-on-demand.

"DVD's will dominate for another decade," Mr. Hastings said.
Studios make money when Netflix and other companies rent out their movies.
(Depending on the studio and movie, Netflix either buys the DVD's or licenses the use of them.)
But the amount that studios make on rentals pales compared to how much they make when consumers buy discs.
Studios earn $17.26 for each DVD they sell, but only $2.37 for movies on demand and $2.25 per DVD rented, according to Tom Adams, the president of Adams Media Research.

"It's a business model that can't be matched," he said.
That differential in profits means that the standard DVD will be around for a while, whatever the promise of those new technologies.
Though sales are no longer growing at double-digit rates, consumers in the United States still buy about $16 billion worth of DVD's a year.

Part of the DVD's success is that the discs are easy to buy, easy to use and relatively inexpensive, thanks to the well-oiled system of getting them into consumers' hands.
Take Technicolor's sprawling facilities in Camarillo, Calif., about 50 miles north of Los Angeles.
Technicolor, a unit of Thomson that is one of the world's leading disc makers, ships about 150 million DVD's a year from its operations — about 9 percent of its global production — to stores throughout the western United States.
In one wing, robotic machines spit out new discs about every three seconds.
The discs are wheeled into adjoining buildings, where they are fed into plastic cases that are wrapped for shipping.
At another warehouse, the DVD's are packed into ready-made cardboard displays, plunked onto pallets and shipped on behalf of the studios to Best Buy, Costco and other retailers, arriving within days of being ordered.

Retailers love DVD's because they spur other sales, too.
Customers who buy DVD's at Wal-Mart, which sells $4.7 billion worth of discs a year, spend twice as much on each store visit on average because they also buy popcorn, beer and other items to go with their movies, according to Mr. Hoffman of Nielsen VideoScan.
The money that DVD's spin off is a big reason the studios are pushing new high-definition DVD's, which are sold and used just like standard-definition discs.

Unfortunately, there's a hitch.
The split could keep consumers on the sidelines, because they risk getting saddled with obsolete players and discs if one side ultimately backs down.
Cost is another factor.
Toshiba has introduced a $500 player that, at least for now, can only play movies from three major studios.
Later this month, Samsung will release the first Blu-ray machine, which will be able to play more movies, but it is expected to cost about $1,000.

Technical hurdles were behind Pioneer's decision last week to delay the release of its Blu-ray player — which will cost about $1,500 — until September.
Studios have released only a handful of movies thus far because so few players have been sold.
Another complication is that consumers with older high-definition television sets may not get the best possible picture if studios activate certain copy protection software embedded on their DVD's.

"Both formats coming to market are early," said Craig Kornblau, the president of Universal Studios Home Entertainment.
"This is all a 1.0 release," referring to an early version of a product.
Proponents in both camps hope that video game players will popularize their formats.
The PlayStation 3, due out in November, will play Blu-ray DVD's, and Microsoft is creating an accessory for its Xbox 360 console that will play HD-DVD discs.
The studios also expect the boom in sales of high-definition television sets to heighten interest in high-definition DVD's, including older movies re-released in the new format.

"As people invest in LCD and flat-panel TV's, they are naturally going to want to invest in high-definition movies," said Benjamin S. Feingold, the president of worldwide home entertainment, digital distribution and acquisitions at Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.
Even so, the companies backing both high-definition formats are likely to see only modest sales initially.
Consumers will buy just $175 million worth of HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs this year; by 2010, high-definition DVD sales will still be only half those of standard-definition disc sales, according to Adams Media Research.

If you don't consider turning left for three hours a real sport, you might wonder what nutritional perspective a Nascar driver's diet might offer.
But proper food and hydration is becoming as important on the racetrack as it is on the football field or the tennis court.

Stock car racing is a sport in which winning and losing is measured in milliseconds.
Toward the end of a race, after three muscle-tense hours in a cockpit that reaches 120 degrees, dehydration saps concentration and poorly fed muscles fail.
Under that kind of strain, at 190 miles an hour, the wrong dish at lunch or one quart too few of water could mean, quite literally, death.
Not that a change of diet and attitude is easy.
Nascar is a big-bellied sport with Southern roots and several million fans whose food culture is built on barbecues that last three days, funnel-cake stands and homemade beer nuts.
The chef Mario Batali, who waved the green flag to start the Pocono 500 here on Sunday, is trying to nudge Nascar food up the culinary ladder with a new cookbook.
But not too far up.
"Basically we Nascar fans will eat anything, and we're proud of it," he writes in the book, "Mario Tailgates Nascar Style."

With such stakes, the nutritional strategy of the drivers is becoming as important as the choreography of the pit crew and the quality of the tires.
"Taking care of my body is one of the few things I can do as a driver to protect my asset," said Jimmie Johnson, who leads Nascar in points almost midway through the season.

To understand the physical impact of stock car racing, start in the driver's seat.
Roll bars and restraint devices leave barely enough room for a person.
The driver is wedged in so tight that the steering wheel can't be attached till after he (yes, almost always "he") climbs through the window into the seat.

The pressure on a driver doesn't stop with the heat.
Carbon monoxide produces pounding headaches.
On turns, the sideways forces are twice the pull of gravity.
Bumps from other cars and maneuvering around crashes take an emotional toll, further draining energy stored in muscles.
"This has an incredible effect on your internal organs," said Robert Hall, a trainer and nutritional adviser for Scott Riggs, 35, who has been a driver in the Chase for the Nextel Cup, the premier Nascar circuit, for three years.

Mr. Riggs, who finished eighth on Sunday, is not a star of the circuit.
But he believes his strict nutritional program will help him break into the circle of top drivers.
Mr. Hall's plan for Mr. Riggs is based on getting protein into him regularly on the theory that the body will consume its own muscle otherwise.
So every three hours while he's awake Mr. Riggs takes in light protein.
As race day approaches, he increases complex carbohydrates so his glycogen supply will hold out.

The plan isn't groundbreaking sports nutrition.
Mr. Hall developed the plan by studying what he could on racing diets, and there wasn't much.

On race weekends, when Mr. Riggs hangs out in the garage or in the car transporter that doubles as an office and mobile shop, someone on a golf cart will deliver a plate that usually carries a bland trio of skinless chicken breast, whole wheat spiral pasta with a little fat-free Italian dressing and sweet potatoes.

Nascar drivers have only about two months when they aren't racing, less than any other professional athletes.

Especially on race day, what a driver eats takes a back seat to what he drinks.
Sweat is the enemy and hydration the obsession.
Drivers can lose more than three quarts of fluid, maybe eight pounds' worth, in a three-hour race, according to measurements by Jeffrey J. Zachwieja and other scientists at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute in Barrington, Ill.

To help retain water, most drivers drink blends of electrolyte-filled sports drinks and eat as much salt as they can stand.

Forcing drivers to drink during the race is one of the most challenging aspects.
To help, the system was designed so the sports drink is kept cold.
And drivers are encouraged to simply urinate in their suits.
"It's not a matter of comfort," Mr. Ellis said.
"A full bladder can dull the body's natural instinct to hydrate."
(He offers a tip for newcomers: don't hug your Nascar driver as soon as the race is over.)

New VeraSun Shares Soar 30%

Shares of VeraSun Energy, an ethanol producer based in Brookings, S.D., jumped as much as 34 percent in their first day of trading yesterday.
"Ethanol supplies are pretty tight and demand is still rising," said Kevin Buente, who helps oversee a $2 billion portfolio of loans to ethanol makers and farmers at 1st Farm Credit Services, which is based in Normal, Ill. "Anyone who can make ethanol will have no trouble finding buyers for it."
Stocks of ethanol makers, including Pacific Ethanol and Archer Daniels Midland, have almost doubled in the last year.
Fed officials now seem worried that we may be seeing the start of another round of self-sustaining inflation.
But is that a realistic fear?
Only if you think we can have a wage-price spiral without, you know, the wages part.

The point is that wage increases can be a major driver of inflation only if workers consistently receive raises that substantially exceed productivity growth.
And that just hasn't been happening.
In fact, the distinctive feature of the current economic expansion — the reason most Americans are unhappy with the state of the economy, in spite of good numbers for the gross domestic product and explosive growth in corporate profits — is the disconnect between rising worker productivity and stagnant wages.
Over the past five years productivity, as measured by real G.D.P.
per hour worked, has risen by about 14 percent, but the real wages of nonmanagerial workers have risen less than 2 percent.

But if wage pressures are so moderate, where's the inflation coming from?
The answer is soaring oil and commodity prices.

It's true that some widely used inflation measures, like so-called core inflation, strip out the direct "first-round" effects of rising energy prices.
But there are still indirect effects, which usually take some time to show up in the data.
Much of the recent rise in core inflation probably represents the delayed effect of the big run-up in fuel prices a few months ago.
And unless something else happens to drive up oil prices — like, to give a wild example, a military strike on Iran — inflation will probably subside in the months ahead.

And bear in mind that many economists, including Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, have said that a little bit of inflation — say, 2 percent a year on average — is actually good for the economy.
It would be an exaggeration to say that there's no inflation threat at all.
I can think of ways in which inflation could become a problem.
But it's much easier to think of ways in which the Federal Reserve, wrongly focused on the phantom menace of a new wage-price spiral, could be slow to respond to bigger threats, like a rapidly deflating housing bubble.
So I don't fear inflation nearly as much as I fear the fear of inflation.
And I wish the Fed would lighten up on the subject.
Analysts and economists now assume the Fed will raise interest rates again at the next two-day meeting of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee at the end of the month.
The interest rate futures market suggests investors also expect another increase in early August.

REVERSAL OF FORTUNE Financial markets reacted strongly to the news about inflation and the measures needed to contain it.
At the same time, gold tumbled this week, falling below $600 an ounce, even though it traditionally is a hedge against inflation.
Other commodities, notably oil, copper and other metals, also fell early in the week, apparently in anticipation that slower economic growth around the world would reduce demand, only to rally on a belief that global growth will remain strong even if rates rise further in the United States.

The dollar, meanwhile, rallied against both the euro and the yen, attracted by the outlook for higher interest rates on dollar deposits and by the relative safety and liquidity of dollar assets.

Airbus blamed wiring problems for another delay last year.
The A380, like other Airbus craft, uses computers sending electronic signals to control it in flight; this particular plane also comes with a complex multichannel movie and music system.

Adding to Airbus's bad week, Singapore Airlines said that it would buy 20 787-9 aircraft from Boeing, Airbus's only rival in big commercial airliners, and would take options on 20 more.
The list price for 20 787's is $4.52 billion, though sales are usually deeply discounted.

In a letter sent to the company's board, trustees representing the Chandler family — the billionaire former owners of The Los Angeles Times and Tribune's second-largest investor — accused Tribune management of pursuing a failed strategy of combining local TV stations and newspapers and of failing to keep pace with industry rivals.

THE LEGAL OPTION With a growing number of companies falling under suspicion of backdating stock options for their senior executives, pension funds and other major institutional investors started filing lawsuits seeking to recoup some of the risk-free gains corporate officers awarded one another.

Federal prosecutors in New York, meanwhile, subpoenaed records at the job search site Monster.com, seeking information on the timing of stock option grants.
Prosecutors are looking for evidence that the grants were made retroactively to days right before big gains in the stock price.

2 Intermediate People's Court, as a New York Times colleague, Zhao Yan, was enduring a farcical secret trial on Mr. Hu's orders.
Mr. Zhao, a researcher in The Times's Beijing bureau, has already been imprisoned virtually incommunicado for the last 22 months, and he may now face a decade or more in prison.
A group of indignant plainclothes police officers swarmed in and herded us outside.
The courthouse is a perfect symbol of Mr. Hu's vision of China today: a dazzling building with lavish facilities, but empty in every sense.
It's all infrastructure, no software.
It's as if Mr. Hu thinks that building a modern judicial system is about high ceilings and padded seats rather than about laws and justice.
The trial ended in one day without a single witness giving testimony for either side.
The verdict will be handed down soon, and it's almost a foregone conclusion that Mr. Zhao will be sent to prison for a long sentence.

I'm still a believer in China, partly because Mr. Hu and his aides have managed the economy so well.
Mr. Hu has also done well in canceling the agriculture tax and taking other measures to try to address the destabilizing income gaps in China (there, 1 percent of the population now controls 60 percent of the wealth, whereas in the U.S., 5 percent controls 60 percent of the wealth).

Yet ultimately, Mr. Hu's efforts to create stability by clamping down just risk more instability.
Most Chinese don't want upheavals, but they are fed up with corruption and lies, with being blocked from Google and Wikipedia, with having to waste time studying political drivel like Mr. Hu's "Eight Honorables and Eight Shames" campaign.
Wags call it "Hu shuo ba dao," a clever pun that translates as "utter nonsense."
Indeed, Mr. Hu's crackdown has been singularly ineffective, annoying people more than scaring them.
Many Communist Party officials worry that crackdowns just anger and alienate the public; that is why some have talked of allowing people to let off steam through greater freedom of the press and more elections.
But Mr. Hu seems paralyzed, altogether the weakest Chinese leader since Hua Guofeng in the 1970's.
The result?
Brace yourself for turbulence ahead in China.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drowning is the second-leading cause of accidental death among children; and black children and teenagers, from ages 5 to 19, are 2.3 times more likely to drown than whites in this age group.
For children 10 to 14, the rate is five times higher.
Dr. Christine Branche, director of the C.D.C.
's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said that there was not enough data to draw conclusions about the rate of drowning for Hispanic children, although data on other minorities show higher drowning rates over all than for white children.

The statistics have not drawn widespread concern, even though the C.D.C.
and Safe Kids Worldwide, whose mission is to prevent accidental childhood injuries, have publicized the need for water safety.
"We don't need to wait until it's a national health issue," he said.
Dr. Branche, who has been studying drowning data for 15 years, said, "The differences by race have been very consistent over the years," adding that "few people feel comfortable reporting these differences."

For black children, the barriers to swimming are high.
The challenge of attracting minority swimmers today, Mr. Cruzat said, is largely economic.
In 2004, nearly 28 percent of minority children in the United States lived below the poverty level, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.
And swimming lessons are often expensive.
At Asphalt Green, a beginning class costs $27 for each hourlong session, and the classes last 13 to 15 weeks.
Chlorine, a staple in public pools, is also an issue.
"The hair issue is a big one," Dr. Downie said.
"African-American women are always saying: 'What am I going to do with my hair?
I can't get it wet.'
Other barriers go beyond practical considerations.
If parents do not know how to swim, they can see less value in their children's learning.
Parents often react to the drowning numbers by urging their children to stay away from the water, thereby passing on the fear.
The College of Arts and Sciences requires its students to learn to swim before they can graduate, Dr. Donaldson said, a rule that has been in place at least since the early 40's.
"We're hoping that there will be large numbers of Howard graduates going into the middle class whose children will grow up with a different perspective, but whether or not we're doing enough, I'm not really sure," he added.

Howard, one of only three historically black colleges with a scholarship swim team, is also planning to start a community swimming program in its pool next year, directed by its swim coach, Shaffers Rawlings.

"Kids just aren't exposed to it."

Jim Ellis has been trying to draw black children to swimming since 1971, when he founded a program at the Marcus Foster indoor pool in the Philadelphia Department of Recreation, setting in motion a career that will be portrayed in a movie to be released in December.
Mr. Ellis hopes the film, "P.D.R.," will help raise the profile of swimming for black children, but he said the main issue was access to pools.
The largest concentration of minorities is in urban areas, where pools are difficult to build and costly to run.

"We can sell swimming, but we have to have the facilities," Mr. Ellis said.

Fear is the biggest factor, she said, particularly for children who have never swum before.
The teachers say it takes a lot of patience and coaxing, but the results are worth it.
Even if the children do not become expert swimmers, they leave with basic survival skills and are comfortable in the water.
"When they get to the pool, they start looking for you, 'Come on, come on, let's go,' " said Monica Molina, a 22-year-old lifeguard, who came through Asphalt Green's programs and is originally from Colombia.
"It's really great.

The biggest day is the Saturday in late April, called the Big Swim.
Any child who signs up and swims a 25-yard lap receives a medal and a T-shirt.
This year, more than 800 children from 6 to 16 swam, accompanied by family members snapping pictures.
Lifeguards dive in to help swimmers who falter and, inevitably, those who have the most trouble end up getting the most encouragement.
As soon as they hop out of the water, a medal is placed around their necks.

The museum opens to the public on Friday, but it has already been visited by museum directors, anthropologists, private sponsors and the news media.
And, as occurred with Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin, among others, the first work of art to be examined here has been the museum itself.
It is the third built in Paris by Mr. Nouvel, after the Institute of the Arab World and the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art.
While the new museum comprises four connected buildings, one with an exterior wall covered with vegetation, the dominant feature is a 600-foot-long exhibition hall, which mirrors the gentle bend in the Seine and is peppered with 26 multicolored protruding boxes.
This pierlike structure is in turn suspended so that visitors can wander freely around a large and soon-to-be-lush garden that is separated from the busy traffic of the Quai Branly by a 39-foot-high wall.
The museum's atrium is tall enough to accommodate a 46-foot American Indian totem pole from British Columbia, while a glass tower displays some of the museum's musical instruments.
A curving 600-foot-long ramp, inevitably reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, then leads to the display area.

Unusually, this space is one large gallery, albeit divided by leather-covered partitions into the collection's four main geographical regions.
Within each, free-standing display cabinets create a kind of warren, which encourages visitors to explore rather than to follow a particular path.
From indoors, the mysterious boxes protruding from the building become small thematic rooms.

The range of works is nonetheless impressive, with remarkable examples of the masks and statues from Africa and Oceania that a century ago so impressed Fauvist and Cubist artists in Paris.
The Americas section embraces pre-Columbian and American Indian art, while the Asian works address daily life from Indonesia to Vietnam.
(Ancient Asian masterpieces remain in the Musée Guimet, across the Seine.)
In all, a walk through the Musée du Quai Branly (pronounced kay bran-LEE) resembles a journey in which distances of time and space are telescoped into the here and now by the simple beauty and mystery of the works.

Yet even now the institution remains inseparable from politics.
Having noted that his predecessor, President François Mitterrand, built I. M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre, the Bastille Opera, the Grande Arche de la Défense and the François Mitterrand French National Library, Mr. Chirac evidently sees this museum as the cultural monument to his two terms in office.
To realize this project, though, Mr. Chirac had to impose his will.
The bulk of the museum's collection comes from the Musée des Arts Africains et Océaniens, now closed (its building at the Porte Dorée will become a Museum of Immigration), and from the Musée de l'Homme, which complained bitterly over the loss of 250,000 ethnographic objects.

The complexity of creating a museum was further emphasized by the debate over its name.
In another era it might have been called a museum of "primitive art," but that term is now considered pejorative.
The imperial past of France also hovers over the museum.
And while the museum faces no claim for restitution of works gathered by 19th- and early-20th-century explorers, administrators and military officers, a debate about the colonial past is gaining strength here, fed partly by tensions over immigrants from developing nations.

Other questions have been raised about the very philosophy behind this museum.
Do pre-Columbian Mayan figures and 19th-century African masks, for example, have anything in common beyond needing a fine display window in Paris?
And, more pertinently, should objects that were not created as art be presented as art, isolated from their ethnographic context?
Stéphane Martin, the museum's president, said that with its accompanying dance, music and theater programs, the museum should soon become part of cultural life in Paris.
Through its temporary exhibitions, he said, it also intends to work closely with similar museums around the world, notably in countries represented in the collection, to become something of a cultural crossroads.
But for Mr. Chirac, it seems, the museum is above all a response to the new political imperative of rejecting ethnocentrism.
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Reuters) — The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Jack Guynn, said Thursday that he would retire on Oct. 1 after 42 years at the bank and 10 years at its helm.
Mr. Guynn, 63, is a voting member this year of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed committee that sets interest rates, and has been seen by some as relatively hawkish on the need for further policy tightening to keep inflation at bay.
His decision to retire creates a third vacancy on the committee.
The Fed said Wednesday that another governor, Mark W. Olson, would step down June 30, after accepting a job as chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

So is there a solution?
There is, but it is not your typical stern admonishment from consumer advocates about managing your money to that last penny.
As Lewis Mandell, a professor of finance and managerial economics at the State University of New York at Buffalo, sees it: "Some people don't need to balance their checkbooks.
If they have sufficient assets and overdraft protection, there's no real need to worry about balancing their checkbook."
For those who have a pretty good idea of what is in their account and how much they spend every month, laboriously going through every statement can be just a waste of time, he said.

"Today's technology makes it so difficult," Professor Mandell said.

Now, however, "keeping track of what's in a checking account is virtually impossible," he said.
Debits can be for such small amounts — even McDonald's, for example, now encourages people to use their debit cards when paying for a meal — that it is easy to lose track.

"In my case, my accounting system is pretty good, and I have a pretty good idea of where the balance should be," he said.
"I'm not a college student living down to my last nickel or getting hit by $30 or $50 in overdrawn check fees."
Like Professor Mandell, he has more of a financial cushion now than he did when he was raising three daughters.

"I'm more worried about identity theft and look to see if I'm $10,000 off," he said.
Marcia L. Turner, president of the American Association of Daily Money Managers and a former banker who provides financial services for small businesses, nonprofit groups and individuals, agreed with my father.
Nonetheless, she said, too many people have no idea how much money they have — or do not have — in their checking account.
That is particularly true if two people are using the same account.
Now, few customers even deal with a bank teller, let alone know their names, so if you bounce a check, a computer is going to charge you.
But many people feel that overdraft protection, which avoids the hefty cost of a bounced check, takes care of such problems.

There are two common forms of such protection, Ms. Turner said: savings overdraft, in which money is transferred from your savings to cover the exact amount of the overdraft for about $5 a transfer; or an overdraft line of credit, which will cover any checks that are written when you do not have money in your account.
With those accounts, interest rates can run 20 percent or higher, and the customer can incur annual fees as well as a cost for each transaction.

There is another problem: if you end up seriously mismanaging a checking account — for example, you did not reimburse your bank for overdraft amounts or committed fraud — your name could end up on ChexSystems or TeleCheck.
These are nationwide databases that banks and credit unions can use to deny customers a checking account.

Your name stays on ChexSystems, the most widely used database, for five years, although there are programs to help those who have been denied checking accounts find a way back into favor.

One, called Get Checking, is a national organization created in 2001 by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's extension service and the eFunds Corporation, the parent of the ChexSystems report.
Get Checking (getchecking.org) works with community organizations and credit unions, to help those who either have seriously bungled their checking accounts or do not have the credentials to open an account, like immigrants.
It teaches them how to use debit cards wisely and how to balance a checkbook.

To participate in the course, students must pay off all balances owed to all financial institutions, attend a six-hour class that costs $40 a person or $60 a couple and pass a competency test.
They then receive a certificate that some banks and credit unions may accept, permitting them to open a checking account.
"It's the first time we've made a correlation between financial behavior and financial literacy," he said.
Those students might be the future clients of Ms. Turner.
Although she provides all sorts of financial services for clients, there are a few she just balances checkbooks for.
Money managers in her association generally charge $50 to $200 an hour, depending on where they work nationally.
"I love balancing checkbooks, and the more screwed up, the better," she said.
Over here, please.
"You're not unusual," she said.

Online banking might solve the problem, she suggested.
That way we can check to see which debits and direct deposits have cleared daily or weekly.

This seems obvious, but it is something we never did.
She also suggests using software like Quicken to track and manage your finances; it does the math for you, so errors are avoided.
In this age of identity theft, or to ensure you have not been billed more than once for the same debit card transaction, Ms. Turner says, the bare minimum a person should do is to open a statement, examine the transactions to make sure nothing looks fishy and eyeball the balance to ensure it is in the ballpark.

"Because I guarantee you," she said, "if a check bounces, it's going to be the one to the I.R.S.

With reverse mortgages, Ms. Williams said, families can end up depleting what is often their most prized inheritable asset.
And because sudden disability can prod parents to take out such mortgages hastily, there is not always time to consider the issues fully.

Here are the basics: As long as the house is your primary residence and you are at least 62, banks will give you a big portion of its value under the condition that if you move out or die, you or your estate pays back the loan plus interest, set at closing.
The amount you receive depends on your place of residence, current interest rates, the value of the house, your age and the amount still owed on the first mortgage.
A $240,000 house, fully paid off by a 62-year-old in Minneapolis, qualifies for a lump-sum payment of $104,000 under the Federal Housing Administration's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program, the dominant reverse mortgage product.
There are two other payment options: $650 a month while the owner lives in the house, or a line of credit.
(Insurance covers the lender, should an owner live long enough to draw more than the mortgage value.)

Because payouts for the housing agency's reverse mortgages are based only on the first $360,000 in home value, higher-priced homes do not fetch much more.
Under the same loan program, a $700,000 house in Westport, Conn., would rate a lump sum of $159,000, monthly payments of $994 or a credit line.

Payout options can get more complex depending on which of the three products you choose.
The intricacies are covered on Web sites like nrmla.org (operated by the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association) and aarp.org/money/revmort/.

Indeed, the complexity of the product is why consumers cannot take out a reverse mortgage without first certifying that they have received advice from a financial counselor approved by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The counseling sessions cover a range of issues.
The loan payout is tax-free, for example, unless you invest the money elsewhere, Ms. Williams said.
And the loans carry fairly high closing costs, so if you were to move out within a few years of the loan, the payout would most likely not be worth the initial expense.
But despite the counseling, industry executives say, horror stories have left a core group of customers leery of reverse mortgages.
Some homeowners who moved out thus ended up owing the amount of the payouts and the entire appreciated value of the home.
No one considering a reverse mortgage today need fear such terms, said Peter H. Bell of the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association.
"Nobody in the marketplace is offering anything of that sort right now," he said.

Are Karl Rove and his liege lord, the bait-and-switch king, trying to have it both ways?
You bet.
And that ought to be a crime, because there are real lives at stake.
The first significant cut under General Casey's plan, according to an article by Michael Gordon in yesterday's Times, would occur in September.
That, of course, would be perfect timing for Republicans campaigning for re-election in November.
How's that for a coincidence?
As Mr. Gordon wrote:
"If executed, the plan could have considerable political significance.
The first reductions would take place before this fall's Congressional elections, while even bigger cuts might come before the 2008 presidential election."

The general's proposal does not call for a complete withdrawal of American troops, and it makes clear that any withdrawals are contingent on progress in the war (which is going horribly at the moment) and improvements in the quality of the fledgling Iraqi government and its security forces.

The one thing you can be sure of is that the administration will milk as much political advantage as it can from this vague and open-ended proposal.
If the election is looking ugly for the G.O.P., a certain number of troops will find themselves waking up stateside instead of in the desert in September and October.

I wonder whether Americans will ever become fed up with the loathsome politicking, the fear-mongering, the dissembling and the gruesome incompetence of this crowd.
From the Bush-Rove perspective, General Casey's plan is not a serious strategic proposal.
It's a straw in the political wind.

How many casualties will be enough?
More than 2,500 American troops who dutifully answered President Bush's call to wage war in Iraq have already perished, and thousands more are struggling in agony with bodies that have been torn or blown apart and psyches that have been permanently wounded.
Has the war been worth their sacrifice?
How many still have to die before we reach a consensus that we've overpaid for Mr. Bush's mad adventure?
Will 5,000 American deaths be enough?
Ten thousand?
The killing continued unabated last week.
Iraq is a sinkhole of destruction, and if Americans could see it close up, the way we saw New Orleans in the immediate aftermath of Katrina, they would be stupefied.

Americans need to understand that Mr. Bush's invasion of Iraq was a strategic blunder of the highest magnitude.
It has resulted in mind-boggling levels of bloodshed, chaos and misery in Iraq, and it certainly hasn't made the U.S. any safer.
We've had enough clownish debates on the Senate floor and elsewhere.
And it's time to stop using generals and their forces under fire in the field for cheap partisan political purposes.

The question that needs to be answered, honestly and urgently (and without regard to partisan politics), is how best to extricate overstretched American troops — some of them serving their third or fourth tours — from the flaming quicksand of an unwinnable war.
A Rise in Premature Births
Premature births are a growing problem in the United States — more than 12 percent of babies born in this country leave the womb three or more weeks before they complete gestation.
The number of premature births has risen 30 percent since 1981, and prematurity is the leading cause of newborn deaths, accounting for nearly a quarter of all deaths during the first month of life.

Several factors have contributed to the rise in premature births, the most important being advances in assisted reproduction.
Women carrying multiples are more likely than those with singleton pregnancies to deliver well before the 40 weeks of a full-term gestation.
And the rate of multiple births in this country has skyrocketed in recent years because of the increased use of ovulation-stimulating drugs and in vitro fertilization.
Even among women who become pregnant naturally, the growing numbers who are now conceiving at older ages have an increased likelihood of having twins.
At the same time, neonatal care has improved to where the lives of many of the tiniest babies, some born after only 23 weeks in the womb, can now be saved.
But the number of ups and downs these very immature babies go through can take a dreadful toll on the sanity of parents, the strength of a marriage and the attention paid to a family's other children.

The goal of the N.I.C.U., said Dr. Andrew Barden, neonatologist at St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is to "support the miniature organ systems of these premature babies until they are ready to live in a terrestrial environment."

Dr. Barden continued, "As technological advances allow more smaller babies to survive, their brain development increases in importance.
We're working to have the best fourth grader possible."

Dr. Barden has found that the babies do better if they are living within the context of a family.
"Our job is to provide the care that the family can't give, and to collaborate with the family to help them relate to the baby and provide the care they can give," he said.
"We need to incorporate parents and family into the minute-to-minute planning for a baby's care."
Meeting the Challenge
The March of Dimes is painfully aware of how challenging a stay in the N.I.C.U.
can be for parents and extended family, be it three days, three months or, in some cases, six months or longer.
And while it has devoted many resources to understand and counter the causes of prematurity, the organization recognizes how important it is to do something now to help people get through a N.I.C.U.
experience.
As of this month, the March of Dimes, based in White Plains, N.Y., has established N.I.C.U.
family support programs in 30 hospitals in 26 states and the District of Columbia.
New York State has two — at Albany Medical Center and at Stony Brook University Hospital.
Nine more programs are expected to be operating by the end of the year.

The March of Dimes program includes helping the nursing and medical staff provide family-centered care.
Parents are included in their babies' care from the start.
Mothers are urged to pump milk for babies that are being fed through tubes.
As soon as the babies are medically stable, they can be taken from their incubators to be held by their mothers and fathers skin to skin, kangaroo style, which has a physiological calming effect on the fragile infants.
Parents of N.I.C.U.
babies are encouraged to interact with one another and with the parents of N.I.C.U.
graduates, who participate in hospital-based support groups to help and reassure those now going through similar experiences.

"The families need emotional help.

The scandal comes as another major central bank, the Bank of Italy, is still trying to regroup after its longtime head, Antonio Fazio, was forced to resign in December after reports that he had improperly interfered in bank deals and that he and his family had accepted improper gifts.
While the criticisms aimed at Mr. Fukui are not nearly as serious as those in Italy, both scandals have called into question the fairness and transparency of the two central banks.
Calls for Mr. Fukui's resignation have been rising, with an opinion poll published Tuesday by Asahi Shimbun, a leading daily newspaper, showing 67 percent of Japanese say Mr. Fukui should step down.
Mr. Fukui is not implicated in Mr. Murakami's insider trading case, and he made the investment as a private citizen in 1999.
The decisions he makes as central bank governor can influence interest rates and economic growth rates, therefore stock prices.
Mr. Fukui's disclosure of the investment also highlighted the lack of transparency at the bank, which has not required its governor to make his assets public, as Ben S. Bernanke, the chief of the Federal Reserve, must do.

On Tuesday, the bank responded to these criticisms by releasing a partial list of Mr. Fukui's personal assets, which totaled 231.7 million yen ($2.01 million) in March.

During a news conference last week, Mr. Fukui apologized for creating the controversy, and he has kept a low profile since then.

Political pressure for Mr. Fukui's resignation reached a new high on Monday, when Takenori Kanzaki, the head of a small party, the New Komeito, in Japan's ruling coalition, was quoted in local press reports saying Mr. Fukui should "decide his own fate."
In the indirect world of Japanese politics, that phrase is often an oblique way to push for someone's resignation.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Koizumi said Mr. Kanzaki made "an obvious remark," according to Japan's Kyodo news service.

Over the weekend, the heads of Japan's four largest opposition parties, issued a joint statement demanding Mr. Fukui's resignation.
The uproar has roiled Japan's financial markets, amplifying the recent volatility displayed by it and other global stock indexes.
It has also sent the yen to a two-month low of 116.70 yen per dollar during trading in Tokyo on Tuesday.

Economists and investors say the biggest fear is that Mr. Fukui's investments and the current scandal could be seen as distorting policy.
This is a particular problem as the Bank of Japan appears increasingly likely to raise interest rates for the first time in six years, possibly as soon as the next meeting of the bank's monetary policy board, July 13-14.

"If this problem keeps rumbling in the background, it could be perceived as influencing Fukui's policy decisions," said Richard Jerram, an economist in Tokyo at Macquarie Securities.
"That is a dangerous position for a central banker to be in."
Mr. Fazio, who has denied wrongdoing, resigned after 12 years in the post.
Rome reacted to restore faith in the central bank by appointing a new head, Mario Draghi, a former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and holder of a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In the case of Japan, the bank is eager to show that it is up to the task of managing the country's $4.6 trillion economy.
If Mr. Fukui does resign, economists say, he is likely to do so quickly, before the bank moves on interest rates.
Economists say the most likely candidate to succeed him is Toshiro Muto, a deputy governor who shares Mr. Fukui's views and would probably maintain continuity in policy.
