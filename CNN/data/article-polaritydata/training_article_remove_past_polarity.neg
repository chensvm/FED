Only two people at a time can participate in this work (there is no other audience; so much for the producer’s fantasy).
It requires the audience-members-turned-actors to follow a recorded script and essentially perform for one another.
The show, which makes the point quite creatively that every conversation is a performance, opened in London in February and has been performed in Portugal, Argentina, Germany, Norway, Italy and Minneapolis (where it was an installation in the lobby of the Guthrie Theater).
It has yet to be presented in New York, but Mark Russell, producer of the Under the Radar festival, says he is currently “working out the details” for a production next year.
“Etiquette” is not technically part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe — Rotozaza wanted to avoid the application fee — but it’s playing during the duration of the Fringe (which opened Sunday and runs through Aug. 27) in the cafe of one of its busy performance spots, Aurora Nova.

“Take a deep breath and clear your throat,” a woman told me in an authoritative English accent, before explaining that the table before me was a stage and I was an actor who didn’t know my lines.

Since for much of “Etiquette” (which begins every half-hour, from 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.) the participants are wearing headphones and speaking in a conversational tone of voice, others in the cafe pay no attention and are possibly unaware that a performance is even under way.

I then played an old philosopher trying to start a conversation with a beautiful stranger.
It was a stilted exchange, but that might have just been my overacting.
“It often happens to me,” said my wife, repeating dialogue.
“I know what I want to say.
I think before speaking to check if it’s really what I should say.
But when the moment comes to speak: Pfft!
I can’t say it.” Still following orders, I shrugged and said: “No one’s written your lines.
She furrowed her brow, turning in her chair to leave.
Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a pack of girls laughing at what must have looked like an embarrassing marital spat.

“There’s something very rare and special when two people find a bubble in a public space,” Ms. Mercuriali said in an interview.
“It’s like when two people have a genuine exchange of ideas or when they are falling in love.
It’s that sense of event and of moment that we’re trying to recreate.”

Mr. Hampton and Ms. Mercuriali founded Rotozaza (named after a sculpture by the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely) in 1998 after meeting at a theater workshop in Italy.
They began experimenting with guest performers as a way to help a friend overcome stage fright.
They wrote a play, “[Bloke],” that he could star in while having his lines fed to him through headphones.

“There is a quality to unrehearsed performance that can be quite beautiful, but it’s something that any good actor could fake,” Mr. Hampton said.
“It’s more about the situation in the room.
If you tell an audience that these are unrehearsed, they become invested in what is going on in a very different way.”

Indeed, part of the reason their shows are so gripping is the constant threat of disaster: flubbed lines, missed cues, technical difficulties.
Some of these errors are built into the script just to remind audiences that they are indeed watching a live performance that could at any point go terribly wrong.
“Audiences are desperate for something that isn’t contrived and Rotozaza gives it to them by playing with the idea of real people losing control,” said Vallejo Gantner, artistic director of Performance Space 122 in Manhattan, which presented two of Rotozaza’s shows, “Five in the Morning” and “Doublethink,” earlier this year.
At the same time, Rotozaza’s work exists in a tightly controlled world in which free will can seem like an illusion.
In “Five in the Morning,” for instance, three willing guest performers (or are they real?)
tremble inside a futuristic amusement park, Aquaworld, while a disembodied voice orders them to perform various mundane and humiliating tasks.

“Etiquette,” however, is slightly different since the characters appear paralyzed by themselves.
“I’m not very optimistic about real communication,” Ms. Mercuriali said.
“There’s this constant inner dialogue in which we’re worried about what others think of us.
In real life, we are both performer and audience member.
Our show isn’t any different.”
This could turn out to be nothing more than a brief scare.
At worst, however, it could cause a chain reaction of debt defaults.

The origins of the current crunch lie in the financial follies of the last few years, which in retrospect were as irrational as the dot-com mania.
But investors also snapped up high-yield corporate debt, a k a junk bonds, driving the spread between junk bond yields and U.S. Treasuries down to record lows.
First, the housing bubble popped.
Then subprime melted down.
Since then, markets have been manic-depressive, with triple-digit gains or losses in the Dow Jones industrial average — the rule rather than the exception for the past two weeks.

But yesterday’s announcement by BNP Paribas, a large French bank, that it was suspending the operations of three of its own funds was, if anything, the most ominous news yet.
The suspension was necessary, the bank said, because of “the complete evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments” — that is, there are no buyers.

When liquidity dries up, as I said, it can produce a chain reaction of defaults.
Financial institution A can’t sell its mortgage-backed securities, so it can’t raise enough cash to make the payment it owes to institution B, which then doesn’t have the cash to pay institution C — and those who do have cash sit on it, because they don’t trust anyone else to repay a loan, which makes things even worse.

And here’s the truly scary thing about liquidity crises: it’s very hard for policy makers to do anything about them.
The Fed normally responds to economic problems by cutting interest rates — and as of yesterday morning the futures markets put the probability of a rate cut by the Fed before the end of next month at almost 100 percent.
It can also lend money to banks that are short of cash: yesterday the European Central Bank, the Fed’s trans-Atlantic counterpart, lent banks $130 billion, saying that it would provide unlimited cash if necessary, and the Fed pumped in $24 billion.
But when liquidity dries up, the normal tools of policy lose much of their effectiveness.
Reducing the cost of money doesn’t do much for borrowers if nobody is willing to make loans.
Ensuring that banks have plenty of cash doesn’t do much if the cash stays in the banks’ vaults.
There are other, more exotic things the Fed and, more important, the executive branch of the U.S. government could do to contain the crisis if the standard policies don’t work.
But for a variety of reasons, not least the current administration’s record of incompetence, we’d really rather not go there.

Let’s hope, then, that this crisis blows over as quickly as that of 1998.
But I wouldn’t count on it.
Lower interest rates would help operators of hedge funds and other money managers because the housing market presumably would strengthen as mortgage rates fell.
A revived mortgage market would give the hedge fund operators and other holders of the risky securities a chance to sell them, which they are having trouble doing now in the current nervous market.

But others see a bigger danger for the economy in acting on the pleas of Mr. Cramer and others on Wall Street.
Cutting interest rates to help the hedge funds would tend to encourage a resurgence of the very risky mortgage lending that has caused the current turmoil, rekindling the crisis.
The issue is often referred to as “moral hazard,” meaning that the risk-takers who brought on this panic would feel bailed out and would be more likely do it again — just as a young adult whose parents paid off a large credit card bill might feel free to run up a debt again.
“They are getting punished now, and if you ease interest rates, you reduce the punishment.” Mr. Bernanke sees the issue in a more pragmatic way.
The Fed’s actions and words suggest that, far from concerning himself with moral hazard, the Fed chairman is trying to protect, and thus reassure, ordinary investors in stocks and bonds.

By pumping a total of $62 billion on Thursday and yesterday into the pool of funds available for lending, the Fed can help enable small investors to continue to trade securities, confident that the checks they receive from their brokers will not bounce.
This new liquidity allows the banks to provide credit to the marketplace without driving up interest rates.

Short-term rates, in fact, had spiked because of the panic, and the Fed’s action brought the key rate that it controls back to the 5.25 percent level that the Fed considers about right to keep the economy growing while minimizing the risk of higher inflation and, eventually, a slowing economy.

“The first line of defense for dealing with a liquidity problem is to make sure the system has enough reserves, so there can be an adequate amount of lending,” said Brian Sack, an economist at Macro Economic Advisers.
The next line of defense, if the market jitters were to persist and threaten a recession, would be to cut interest rates.
Mr. Cramer and some others on Wall Street want Mr. Bernanke to do that now.

Mr. Bernanke has kept the so-called federal funds rate steady for more than a year, arguing as recently as this week that the economy is reasonably strong and that cutting interest rates might drive up inflation.

“The predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected,” the Fed said in a statement after its last policy meeting, on Tuesday.

Still, if the panic persists and the economy begins to suffer, Mr. Bernanke would presumably be forced to rely on the only other tool the Fed has: a rate cut.

His training, and the books and scholarly papers he has written, suggest he would be reluctant to do that.
In some circles, he has been called Helicopter Ben, because of a 2002 speech in which he suggested that if interest rates went to zero in a very weak economy, he would resort to showering money from helicopters into the financial system to keep it humming.
Some have cited the nickname in urging him to cut interest rates, which is a different issue than the one he was discussing in 2002.
Indeed, his background suggests a different way of thinking, one in which market panics should be dealt with not by cutting interest rates but by focusing on short-term liquidity.

As a Princeton University economist, for example, he wrote extensively in the 1980s about the causes of the Great Depression.
He produced two major books on the subject and he argued that the Fed could have prevented the damaging bank runs if it had provided the necessary liquidity, as he is trying to do now, thus calming depositors instead of forcing banks to turn them away empty-handed.
The Fed failed to do so in the 1930s, departing from tradition.
For more than 150 years, Mr. Bernanke has noted, central banks have played the role of lender of last resort, providing enough liquidity to allow banks to operate normally, regardless of the pressures on them.

Some argue that if Mr. Bernanke is unwilling to cut the federal funds rate of 5.25 percent — the interest that banks pay to borrow from the marketplace — then the Fed should at least cut its discount rate.
This is the rate that the Fed charges to lend money directly to banks and other lending institutions, and it is now at 6.25 percent.
Mr. Cramer, among others, has called for a discount rate cut, but Mr. Hatzius argues that such a cut might add to the gathering crisis.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Most traders, he notes, expect that by the end of the year, the Fed will have cut the federal funds rate by half a percentage point.

“If the Fed were to cut the discount rate,” Mr. Hatzius said, “then you would multiply the expectations of a much bigger cut in the federal funds rate, and that in itself could be damaging for the economy.”

For all the turmoil in the markets this past week, the number of people involved appears to be relatively small.
They are mostly engaged in hedge funds, banks and mortgage lending and they are usually wealthy.
Hedge funds, for example, require investors to have a net worth of at least $5 million.
“It is a limited crisis as of now,” said Albert M. Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist.
“And if I had to bet my life, I would bet that it would remain that way.
But I would not want to bet my life.”
In Mr. Durham’s case, there were two important benefits: he had other uses for the money and, by stretching the payments over several years, he could put off paying some of the sales tax.
For a car in this price bracket, taxes alone can run to six figures, depending on where the deal is struck.

“One of the biggest things is you’re deferring your tax because the sales tax is getting stretched over some period of time,” said Mr. Durham, whose investment firm, Obsidian Enterprises, controls several industrial companies as well as National Lampoon.
Although he expects to buy the Bugatti by the end of the five-year lease term — at an additional cost of several hundred thousand dollars — Mr. Durham said he would rather invest the difference in the meantime.
He also said he expected that in coming years the Bugatti would be worth more than he has agreed to pay for it.
“If you think you can make more on your money than the cost of the lease, then you ought to lease, especially on an appreciating asset like the Bugatti,” Mr. Durham said in late July, as he prepared to drive the 1,001-horsepower Veyron in the Great American Run, a coast-to-coast rally.

Mr. Durham said his collection of more than 70 cars was filled with models that had sentimental value to him, including vintage Auburns, Cords and Duesenbergs and an Aston Martin DB5 like the one James Bond drove in “Goldfinger.”

But he still drives a sharp bargain when it comes to acquiring them: he had a lease lined up for the Veyron with a company that specializes in financing Ferraris and other expensive cars when a competing offer landed.

Donald Fort, a collector in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., said leasing his acquisitions had allowed him to build his collection twice as fast.
His collection now includes rare American sports cars like a 1963 Corvette Z06.
Since then, he has leased cars like a Shelby Cobra over five years, then bought them at the end of the lease.
Typically, the down payment is 20 percent to 25 percent of the purchase price.

But Steven Posner, chief executive of Putnam, said that many of his company’s first-time customers leased for the opposite reason.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“Why invest so much money in a depreciating asset?” Mr. Posner said, referring to the possibility that the exotic brands on which Putnam built its business do not always gain value, especially when first introduced.
About two-thirds of the people leasing a new Ferrari do not keep it until the end of the lease, Mr. Posner said.
Many of them decide to trade up to a newer or more expensive model, he said, while some others decide that they have had their fling with hot Italian models.

“You’ll get a young man in his 20s on Wall Street” who leases a Ferrari 355, Mr. Posner said.
“As he makes more money, he will trade that in for a 360.
In the interim, he’ll get on a list for a 430.
“Within two years, you’ll see a guy go from one car to the next to the next,” he said.
To accommodate capricious enthusiasts, Putnam allows its customers to trade out of one car into another under the same lease, charging no penalty, just the difference between the wholesale value of the first car at the time and Putnam’s price for the new one, Mr. Posner said.

But leasing a superluxury item like a Bentley or a Bugatti would be too pretentious for most people in some regions of the country, said Mitch Katz, chief executive of Premier Financial Services, a finance company based in Woodbury, Conn.

“They feel that to own a toy like this, if they can’t write the check, they shouldn’t own it,” Mr. Katz said, “That’s more the prevailing feeling in the Midwest and New England.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Only about one-fourth of these very expensive cars are leased, Mr. Katz estimated.
About half are bought for cash and the rest are purchased with the help of a bank loan, he said.
About half of the leases are held in the names of corporations, whose owners have found a way to claim some or all of the cost as a business expense, he added.

Mr. Katz said his company sent representatives to major auctions of collector cars, offering financing to successful bidders.
Location is also an important factor in the financing because many states allow leaseholders to pay sales tax month by month.
New York and New Jersey are two that do not, Mr. Posner said.
For example, a customer who lives in Manhattan and registers his car there pays 8.375 percent tax on the entire lease value upfront; that would come to more than $130,000 on Mr. Durham’s Bugatti (and there is no credit if the lease is broken early).
But Mr. Durham, the Indianapolis financier, can pay that state’s 6 percent tax with each lease payment.
Still, Indiana does have its disadvantages for a collector who likes to take his prized possessions out for a regular spin.

“Of course, I drive a different one every day,” Mr. Durham said.

Thornburg has prospered until now with a fairly simple formula.
Organized as a REIT, it paid big dividends representing all of its taxable income.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The insiders profited hugely from that.
The company gets away with not disclosing how much the bosses are paid because it is managed by a separate company owned by some of the bosses.
That management company gets incentive fees based on book value and profits that would seem familiar to a hedge fund manager.
Effectively, the bosses get a cut every time the company sells new stock, and keep getting cuts from those sales every year unless and until they lose the money.
Now Thornburg, and many other companies, need a quick defreezing of the credit markets.
But even if they get it — if the Fed tells banks to rescue them with emergency loans — many may find that they cannot safely operate with such high leverage.
And without the leverage, profits will be harder to make even if Thornburg can charge more for mortgage loans.

It is sort of like a game of musical chairs in which the music stops and it turns out that all the chairs have vanished.
According to data released yesterday, both housing starts and applications for building permits have fallen to their lowest levels in a decade, showing that home construction is still in free fall.
And if historical relationships are any guide, home prices are still way too high.
The housing slump will probably be with us for years, not months.
Meanwhile, it’s becoming clear that the mortgage problem is anything but contained.
There are also growing problems in so-called Alt-A mortgages (don’t ask), which are another 20 percent of the mortgage market.
Problems are starting to appear in prime loans, too — all of which is what you would expect given the depth of the housing slump.
Many on Wall Street are clamoring for a bailout — for Fannie Mae or the Federal Reserve or someone to step in and buy mortgage-backed securities from troubled hedge funds.
But that would be like having the taxpayers bail out Enron or WorldCom when they went bust — it would be saving bad actors from the consequences of their misdeeds.

For it is becoming increasingly clear that the real-estate bubble of recent years, like the stock bubble of the late 1990s, both caused and was fed by widespread malfeasance.
Rating agencies like Moody’s Investors Service, which get paid a lot of money for rating mortgage-backed securities, seem to have played a similar role to that played by complaisant accountants in the corporate scandals of a few years ago.
Three other men now say, as Joe Dick does, that they falsely confessed to involvement in the rape and murder of Moore-Bosko under pressure from Ford.
Damian J. Hansen, one of three assistant commonwealth’s attorneys who prosecuted the so-called Norfolk Four and four other men for the murder, says their claims are nothing more than “sound bites” invented by “hired gun” experts and what he calls the “clemency gang,” a team of high-powered New York and Washington attorneys who have asked Gov.
Tim Kaine to grant the Norfolk Four an absolute pardon.
“There is no new evidence” of innocence, Hansen says.
“There are no unanswered questions.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Nevertheless, the Norfolk Four count a growing list of supporters, including four former Virginia attorneys general, one of them a Republican, who have no obvious motive for suggesting that the state perpetrated a major miscarriage of justice.
George Allen, said the “totality of the scientific evidence” and “the crime scene being inconsistent with the prosecution theory” convinced him that the four are innocent.
Governor Kaine, a Democrat, will be under enormous pressure to reject clemency for the three defendants serving life sentences and a fourth who was released after more than eight years in prison.
Moreover, a pardon would probably be seen as a tacit repudiation of the police and prosecutors.
Assuming Kaine can set politics aside and focus solely on the voluminous evidence, he is likely to find that the controversy turns on two complex and interrelated questions.
Because the state had no outside witnesses and no physical evidence linking any of the four to the crime — no blood, saliva, hair, fibers, fingerprints or DNA — the case rested almost entirely on the defendants’ own confessions, all given in the absence of attorneys.
Second, Kaine will have to decide whether the crime was committed by eight men, as the state maintains, or by one man, as is argued by Cullen and other defenders of the Norfolk Four.
More specifically, he might want to examine how the state’s theory evolved from a crime committed by a single perpetrator to one involving two assailants, then three, six, seven and finally eight men who the state says took turns raping and stabbing the 18-year-old victim.

Two Confessions, Two Versions of The Crime

The Gates of West Bay apartments are a modest collection of tidy, two-story red-brick buildings located only a short walk from Gate 4 of the Norfolk naval station.

On July 8, 1997, Bill returned from a week at sea aboard the U.S.S.
Now 35 and serving a life sentence at the Sussex II State Prison in Waverly, Va., Williams, like the other Norfolk Four defendants, had no prior criminal record.
But he said in an interview (and in an affidavit) that Ford treated him like a criminal from the outset, poking him in the chest, yelling in his face, calling him a liar and telling him, falsely, that he’d failed a polygraph test and that a witness saw him go into the apartment.
“They wear you down to the point that you’re exhausted.
I just wanted the questioning to end.”

Ford has testified on several occasions that he has never coerced or threatened witnesses, fed them information or otherwise encouraged a false confession.

Based on their statements to the police, Dick and Williams might seem an odd pair of accomplices.
Williams denied choking her and said he didn’t use a weapon.
Neither Dick nor Williams could accurately describe the knife.
None of this seemed to trouble Ford or the prosecutors.
The state argued that the defendants’ accounts of what happened were consistent “at their core,” and that guilty people often lie or change their stories before telling the truth confessing.
But Richard J. Ofshe, an expert on police interrogations who was hired by lawyers for the Norfolk Four, says the Williams and Dick misstatements and others that would follow are typical of a “classic false confession” and are evidence of the defendants’ innocence.
Or so says Dr. Werner U. Spitz, a medical doctor and professor of forensic pathology at Wayne State University School of Medicine who has worked on nearly 60,000 autopsies over 50 years.
Spitz, who was hired by the Norfolk Four attorneys, says a careful examination of the victim’s wounds make it “extraordinarily unlikely that more than one person” wielded the knife and “even less likely that several people” stabbed her to death.
Assuming the state’s final theory, that eight men took turns stabbing the victim through her black T-shirt, Spitz wondered out loud, “How does the next guy know where to stab her?” to get this concentrated pattern with wounds at precisely the same angle.
I asked Dr. John E. Adams, a Maryland forensic pathologist who has testified in more than 500 cases but not in the Norfolk Four case, to look at the autopsy and knife-wound evidence.
He points out that the wound evidence, the appearance of the apartment and the inconsistencies in the defendants’ statements were all thoroughly aired.
What the juries also heard, most convincingly, was the one thing that is almost impossible to rebut — a defendant’s recorded confession.
A confession, one legal scholar wrote, “makes the other aspects of a trial in court superfluous.”

But his continued insistence on the guilt of Danser and Pauley has raised more than a few questions about the credibility of the rest of the case against the Norfolk Four.

Why Would Someone Falsely Confess?
Because most suspects who confess to a crime are in fact guilty, it is not surprising that most of us have a hard time accepting the idea that someone would falsely confess.
Yes, there are torture victims and malleable children and publicity seekers.
But grown men in the U.S. military?
“People just do not confess,” Hansen told jurors in Tice’s second trial, “to something of this magnitude, this heinous, this vicious, without having participated in it.
It’s just not natural; it’s just not reasonable.”

That is certainly the conventional wisdom.
But consider, for example, the case of Billy Gene Davis, who, after twice failing a polygraph test, confessed to killing his girlfriend in Austin, Tex., in 1990.
According to the Innocence Project, 49 people whose convictions relied on false confessions have been proved innocent and released from prison based on DNA evidence.
In Virginia, Earl Washington Jr., a mentally retarded man, spent 17 years in prison after falsely confessing to the rape and murder of a 19-year-old mother of three.
But why do some people confess when others don’t?
Ochoa confessed; Danziger didn’t.
Along the continuum from mild questioning to torture, it is difficult to predict when, if ever, any particular individual will break down and confess, truthfully or not.
Nevertheless, studies of proved false confessions suggest a number of recurring markers including actual violence, threats of violence, threats of harsh sentences like execution and extreme duress brought about by isolation, sleeplessness and lengthy, high-pressure interrogation.
Police interrogation is designed to be stressful and disorienting and to keep the suspect off-balance.
Guilt is frequently presumed.
Police may legally pressure suspects using fabricated evidence, phony witnesses and lies about DNA or polygraph results.
But it’s also the case that all of these men had served in the military.
Dick and Tice are sons of veterans.
All four were used to taking orders.
(One study found that approximately 80 percent of suspects waive the right to counsel, and people with no prior felony record are more likely to do so.)

Two law professors who study the false-confession phenomenon, Steven Drizin and Richard Leo, claim that police detectives “typically close” an investigation once they obtain any confession, “even if the confession is internally inconsistent, contradicted by external evidence or the result of coercive interrogation.” After all, it seems so unreasonable to think that someone would confess to a crime he didn’t commit.
Likewise, the authors wrote, prosecutors “rarely consider the possibility that an entirely innocent suspect has been made to confess falsely through the use of psychologically coercive and/or improper interrogation methods.”

Ford certainly knew false confessions were possible.
Ford has acknowledged that the three falsely confessed to being at the scene of the murder but insisted that they helped to plan the crime.
Whether Ford “obtained a false confession or not seems to me to be relatively benign,” Poston said, “because I suspect that many police officers have done that, because we have all seen people who confess to anything.” Poston opined that it was neither “unusual” nor “rare” for people to confess to crimes “totally imagined.”

But three jurors I interviewed from Tice’s first trial were anything but blasé about his 18-minute taped confession.
The tape is, indeed, chilling.
“Does that sound like someone who is being pressured into making a statement?” According to Randall McFarlane, the jury foreman, “Nothing could blunt the force of that taped confession.”

Finally, A DNA Match

By December 1998, 18 months after the murder, the state had seven men imprisoned but still no DNA match.
Curiously, a warrant for Ballard’s arrest for the baseball-bat assault was issued the same evening the police were grilling their first suspect, Danial Williams, putting Ballard squarely on the police radar for a crime committed only a few hundred feet from the murder scene.
At the end of his recorded confession, Ford asked Ballard, “Is there anything you wish to add to this statement?” Ballard replied, “No, just them four people that opened their mouths is stupid.”

Ballard’s confession complicated the state’s case yet again.
Under the new theory, Ballard, who has an extensive criminal record and a history of assaulting women, protected seven men he didn’t know.
According to the state, he did so because he was at the time serving a life sentence and feared being labeled a “snitch.” Moreover, prosecutors argued, Ballard, who is black, was afraid people would know he’d committed a crime with “white boys.” At the same time, the state’s theory would mean that the white defendants, who didn’t have criminal records, resolutely refused to name Ballard under grueling interrogations even though three of them were willing to incriminate other accomplices, simply because they were afraid of Ballard.
Lawyers for the Norfolk Four say the obvious reason Ballard didn’t identify the seven whites was that he didn’t know them, they didn’t know him and he committed the crime alone.
That’s why the apartment is largely undisturbed, the knife wounds are in a tight pattern and the DNA matches only Ballard’s.
A year after confessing and telling Ford he acted alone, Ballard was brought to the Norfolk Police interrogation room, where he claims Ford told him that in order to “escape the death penalty,” he would have to sign off on “a version of the story that I never heard of before.” Ballard says he agreed to incriminate the Norfolk Four in exchange for two life sentences.
He now says the statement he signed was “totally false.”

Ballard never testified before a jury against any of the Norfolk Four defendants.
In his little booth on the top of Keen Mountain, Joe Dick says he never should have named Eric Wilson and Derek Tice.
For his part, Derek Tice, whose conviction was overturned but who remains in prison awaiting a third trial, says he feels “horrible” that in “trying to save my own life” he brought “three innocent people” into the case.
“If I could talk to them, I would ask their forgiveness and hope that they would understand.” Senior Chief Michael Ziegler, now based in Nevada, says he regrets he didn’t do more to save Joe Dick.
“I wish I’d gone and forced someone to listen to me — Joe’s lawyer, the police, the D.A.
I couldn’t conceive that someone who was obviously innocent was going to go to jail.
That’s where I was wrong.”
Traditional banks promise depositors the right to withdraw their funds at any time.
Yet banks lend out most of the money depositors place in their care, keeping only a fraction in cash.
The reason this works is that normally a bank’s depositors want to withdraw only a small proportion of their money on any given day.

Banks get in trouble, however, when some event, like a rumor that major loans have gone bad, leads many depositors to demand their money at the same time.
The scary thing about bank runs is that doubts about a bank’s soundness can be a self-fulfilling prophecy: a bank that should be safely in the black can nonetheless fail if it’s forced to sell assets in a hurry.
And bank failures can have devastating economic effects.
Many economists believe that the banking panic of the early 1930s, not the stock market crash of 1929, was the principal cause of the Great Depression.

That’s why bank deposits are now protected by a combination of guarantees and regulation.
On one side, deposits are federally insured, and the Federal Reserve stands ready to rush cash to troubled banks if necessary.
On the other side, banks are required to keep adequate reserves, have adequate capital and make conservative loans.

But these guarantees and regulations apply only to traditional banks.
Meanwhile, a growing number of unregulated bank-like institutions have become vulnerable to the 21st-century version of bank runs.

Consider the case of KKR Financial Holdings, an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a powerhouse Wall Street operator.
KKR Financial raises money by issuing asset-backed commercial paper — a claim that’s sort of like a short-term C.D., used by large investors to temporarily park funds — and invests most of this money in longer-term assets.
So the company is acting as a kind of bank, one that offers a higher interest rate than ordinary banks pay their clients.

It sounds like a great deal — except that last week KKR Financial announced that it was seeking to delay $5 billion in repayments.
That’s the equivalent of a bank closing its doors because it’s running out of cash.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The problems at KKR Financial are part of a broader picture in which many investors, spooked by the problems in the mortgage market, have been pulling their money out of institutions that use short-term borrowing to finance long-term investments.
These institutions aren’t called banks, but in economic terms what’s been happening amounts to a burgeoning banking panic.
On Friday, the Federal Reserve tried to quell this panic by announcing a surprise cut in the discount rate, the rate at which it lends money to banks.
It remains to be seen whether the move will do the trick.
The problem, as many observers have noticed, is that the Fed’s move is largely symbolic.
It makes more funds available to depository institutions, a k a old-fashioned banks — but old-fashioned banks aren’t where the crisis is centered.
And the Fed doesn’t have any clear way to deal with bank runs on institutions that aren’t called banks.
Now, sometimes symbolic gestures are enough.
The Fed’s surprise quarter-point interest rate cut in October 1998, at the height of the crisis caused by the implosion of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, was similarly a case of providing money where it wasn’t needed.

Friday’s cut might do the same thing.
But if it doesn’t, it’s not clear what comes next.
Whatever happens now, it’s hard to avoid the sense that the growing complexity of our financial system is making it increasingly prone to crises — crises that are beyond the ability of traditional policies to handle.
Maybe we’ll make it through this crisis unscathed.
But what about the next one, or the one after that?
“It gives the market a little comfort that it’s not all about buying risk-free securities,” said Scott Wren, equity strategist for A. G. Edwards & Sons.
“There’s less of a flight to quality.”

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about four to one on the New York Stock Exchange.
But desperate times call for desperate measures.
While Americans fear an epidemic of foreclosures, brought on by the subprime mortgage meltdown, Britain is already suffering one.

Foreclosures here are at an eight-year high; lenders have repossessed a record 14,000 properties in 2007, 30 percent more than at the same time last year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
An additional 125,100 households are behind in their mortgage payments.
And personal bankruptcies are at an all-time record, caused largely by a crushing increase in mortgage debt.
The situation has grown so dire — as has the threat of desperate homeowners being exploited — that the newly installed government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown is trying to change the fundamentals of the mortgage system.
Whether they can is an open question, especially given Britons’ attachment to home ownership, adjustable-rate mortgages and personal debt.
British consumers are the most indebted citizens of any Group of 7 nation, and television shows devoted to real estate and debt advice are among the most popular programs in the country.

“We live in a society where we encourage people to take on debt, and there is lots of pressure to get your foot on the housing ladder, which has proven quite a fruitful investment for some,” said Frances Walker of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a debt adviser, in London.

Currently, only 5 percent of British home buyers take out fixed-rate mortgages.
The norm here is a mortgage with a fixed rate for the first two years, and then a floating rate for the duration of the mortgage.

But the rate on adjustable mortgages has skyrocketed as the Bank of England ratcheted up interest rates — five times over the last 12 months to 5.75 percent, their highest level since 2001.
Add the rising costs of necessities, like food and utilities, and British homeowners find themselves increasingly squeezed.
Real estate experts here say that is why more and more homeowners are turning to the practice of sale and rent back.
The mushrooming of the unregulated market has worried regulators and lawmakers concerned that homeowners were giving up their houses for as little as 75 percent of market value, with no guarantee they would be allowed to stay in their former property after six months, the minimum lease period here.

Lawmakers are now trying to figure out how to encourage more homeowners to take fixed-rate loans, but that will not help those already facing foreclosure, or prevent the threat of predatory lending.

If there is a silver lining in Britain, it is that, unlike in the United States, home prices are still rising, for now, after more than tripling since 1997.
Recent interest rate increases have yet to reverse the trend.
In fact, the National Housing Federation recently predicted prices would rise 40 percent in the next five years, elevating the average price of a home, which already costs about 11 times the average British salary, to £302,400, or $618,000.

As long as home prices rise, distressed property owners can still sell their home and receive enough money to repay their mortgage debt — in theory.
In reality, selling a property here can take several months, and by the time many owners are facing foreclosure, they often do not have that kind of time.

Higher prices may push some prospective buyers out of the market, but others will simply take out larger mortgages.
Owning a home is so entrenched in the British psyche that most consumers would rather take on additional debt than rent, even if they can’t afford it, say real estate experts.

Some debt advisers have warned that higher demand for borrowing could result in an increase in lax lending practices and plunge more people into personal bankruptcy, which in turn could hurt consumer spending and slow economic growth.
Recognizing that, Mr. Brown’s new government has come up with two initiatives intended to make sure Britain’s housing boom does not turn into a bust.
The measures aim to build 240,000 homes a year by 2016 to provide more affordable housing, and to encourage lenders to sell more 25-year fixed-rate mortgages.

Mortgage experts estimate that about two million mortgages will adjust to a higher rate in the next 18 months as their short-term fixed rates expire.
Longer-term fixed-rate mortgages would limit the risk of such interest rate increases, but short-term thinking among British borrowers and the lack of an established covered-bond market in Britain has kept fixed-rate mortgages from ever taking off here.

The United States mortgage market is financed through capital markets — hence some of the problems currently buffeting the markets — but Britain has always been a retail-led mortgage market, financed through bank savings deposits.

Now Alistair Darling, chancellor of the Exchequer, is studying plans to create a legal framework to allow banks and other lenders to issue covered bonds, and to make them attractive to investors, in order to help lenders create capital pools that would finance longer fixed mortgages.
Yet that task could become markedly more difficult now given the current problems with the United States mortgage market.
“If this deal is ever going to be attractive, now is the time,” Stuart Bernau, Nationwide’s chief executive, said at the time.

Some analysts remain skeptical.
“People don’t feel comfortable tying themselves in for that long, and they get turned off by the penalties” of paying off early, said James Cotton, a mortgage adviser at London & Country Mortgages.
Early payment fees can reach as much as £300,000 in Britain.
But if the government cannot persuade Britons to change their borrowing habits, experts warn that the country may face its own subprime mortgage crisis, as consumers with tarnished credit find that only subprime lenders are willing to work with them.

The problem is fundamental, tied to the imbalance caused by irrationally high home prices and declining optimism that the prices will go higher.
Cutting interest rates will not change this basic situation.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The problem is fundamental because the speculative cycle afflicts much of the world.
Housing booms have not occurred everywhere, but they have been commonplace since the late 1990s in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
We have also seen similar worldwide boom cycles in the stock market over the last 10 or 12 years.
Many countries shared in the huge market booms that peaked in 2000, and just about every major stock market around the world has boomed since 2003.
Classical economics cannot explain this cycle, because underlying these booms is popular reaction to the price increases themselves.
Rising prices encourage investors to expect more price increases, and their optimism feeds back into even more increases, again and again in a vicious circle.
As the boom continues, there is less fear of borrowing heavily, or of lending heavily.
In this situation, lower lending standards seem perfectly appropriate — and even a fair way to permit everyone to prosper.

One might think that investor optimism is generated by rapid world economic growth that is using up scarce resources and driving up asset prices.
Since 2004, the International Monetary Fund’s real per capita growth figures for gross domestic product worldwide have been fairly high: around 4 percent a year.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It is noteworthy that from 1995 to 2003, when these booms took root, that growth figure averaged only 2.4 percent a year.
A good part of the extra growth since 2004 has probably been the increased spending caused by the speculative booms themselves.
The greatest recent economic successes have apparently been in China and India.
Because these are the most populous countries, together accounting for 37 percent of the world’s population, their success has become an international symbol of spectacular growth.
But it is easy to overstate their importance.
China’s and India’s economies are actually a tiny fraction of world G.D.P.— together only 7 percent.
The popular impressions of suddenly rapid growth are thus mostly a perceptual error, like the optical illusions documented by psychologists.

Democrats say the plight of the estimated two million homeowners who face higher costs because payments on their adjustable-rate mortgages are expected to rise has become a potent political issue.

But the administration says that it is one thing to help people caught between falling home prices and rising interest rates, and another to bail out speculators who find themselves unable to make a quick profit.
This official estimated that of the two million mortgage holders facing new interest rates, 500,000 are at risk of foreclosure because of missed payments.
The administration’s announcement Friday will affect only 80,000 homeowners through actions that it can take through the Federal Housing Administration, without Congressional participation.

The reason Fahey has spent his scientific career investigating all manner of starch, carbohydrate and fiber, the reason he has put tubes inside dogs to analyze what they have digested before they have finished digesting it — that reason suddenly became clear: George Fahey has been confronting the myriad challenges of controlling canine bowel movements.
Premium dog foods contain at least 30 percent protein and 20 percent fat, he said.
“Do we need to feed that much?
No.
But this way, you have a total tract digestibility of 88 percent, which is good if you don’t want that dog to go in your house when you’re out for the day.

For all the apparent variety — store shelves stocked with everything from Alpo to ZiwiPeak — pet food is a business of behemoths and bottom lines, with sales approaching $15 billion last year.

With his academic status and independent financing, George Fahey’s research spares pet-food manufacturers the negative publicity they might attract if they ran their own experiments on surgically altered dogs.

In the book “The Ralston Brain Regime,” a turn-of-the-century human-diet guru named Webster Edgerly presented “a course of conduct, exercises and study designed to develop perfect health in the physical brain.” The name Ralston was itself an acronym of Edgerly’s seven life principles: Regime, Activity, Light, Strength, Temperation, Oxygen and Nature.
Despite the emphasis on health, food for animals has long been prone to potentially lethal adulteration.
“The animal behaves in a thoroughly panic-stricken manner,” noted a report by Food and Drug Administration scientists in 1948, “throwing itself against the sides of the cage, clawing the air and howling piteously.
If unconfined, it will run wildly about bumping into all objects in its path.” In acute cases the disease culminated in convulsions and death, and the culprit turned out to be a chemical wheat-bleaching agent used in processing flour.

Notwithstanding such occasional defilements, research into pet food and human food continued to follow parallel paths.
When the marketing meetings began, Purina executives decided that instead of distributing the product to the company’s nationwide web of feed stores, this new pet food, code-named X-24, would go to supermarkets, where it could be bought and sold next to human groceries.

The vast majority of America’s 75 million dogs and 88 million cats continue to feed on scraps from the human food industry’s table: pet-food ingredients like ground chicken bones, pig blood and distillers byproducts.
Indeed, when an agriculture-processing company encounters an industrial leftover — corn fiber, let’s say, from its production of ethanol — it might put in a call to George Fahey’s lab.
Fahey has done a great deal of work with corn fiber and is exploring its potential as a source of fiber in the canine diet.
Although pet nutrition has generally followed trends in human nutrition, sometimes that order has been reversed.
“We will see corn fiber in human foods like cereals and snacks,” Fahey told me.
“There’s no reason that it should not be able to be used.” Such adaptations have occurred before.
A major manufacturer of baked goods for humans, he said, picked up on the idea of using hydrogen-peroxide-treated fiber and experimented with mixing the substance into some of its breads.

Experiments with cats and dogs have long been used as a key to the scientific mysteries of the human diet.
For obvious reasons, scientists cannot test human digestion by delivering experimental meals that lack vital nutriments.
Dogs, however, have metabolism similar to ours, they are widely available and their internal organs are larger than those of rats, which makes them well suited to examination.
Paradoxically, the same nutrition experiments that caused disease or death have led to pioneering advances in animal health care.
Because nutritional biochemists have measured almost everything about the canine and feline diets — from energy densities to intestinal transit times — they know what to do when something goes wrong.
The latest word in digestibility studies may have cost lab animals a score of nasty symptoms, but the data gathered will help save many sick pets down the road.
Today the hospital treats more than 25,000 small animals every year, and the nutrition center does much of its work on the clinical frontier where sustenance meets medication.
“We have not seen N.I.H.

The U.S.D.A.

“The clinical nutrition program will spread across the country,” Osburn predicted.
Some of his confidence was surely an administrator’s pride in his university, but it didn’t seem like a stretch to imagine that the nutritional products and procedures developed here — including cancer-care diets and high-fat regimens for anorectic pets — could soon become successful on the mass market.
Dogs and cats are living longer and growing fatter and more dyspeptic, and, like their owners, they have to watch the calories.
Today, as geneticists close in on the cat genome, researchers and pet-food marketers are rushing to find ways to make high-end pet diets even more customized.
“This is part of a larger trend in nutrition: complexity and individualization,” says Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.
“In the future someone is likely to do a genetic profile of your animal and prescribe accordingly.
How accurate or useful this will be is an open question.” Genome-based animal feed may evolve into the ultimate personalized diet for pets, or it may meet the same fate as the unsuccessful collaboration by Carnation and Upjohn in 1985 to market birth-control dog food.

Professor Nestle perceives two tracks for the future feeding of America’s cats and dogs, tracks that parallel the nutrition trends of their owners: The wealthiest 5 to 8 percent of pet owners, those with college educations, annual household incomes in excess of $70,000 and an expanding human diet of organic, locally grown and luxury food products, will provide ever better, fresher and more delicious food for their pets.
The other 92 to 95 percent of pets compose a second track that will consume increasingly industrialized diets.
Even today these diets commonly consist of byproducts cooked into sterile and viscous masses, sheared into the simulacrum of a bone or a patty, and then, according to a report by the National Research Council in Washington, spray-dried with minuscule beadlets of fat, protein and calibrated savor.
Kind of like the industrial, increasingly synthetic and processed diets of their owners.

Nestle’s research for her next book, “What Pets Eat,” has also brought to her attention the enormous numbers of emerging pet-food companies.
(“I just met with this guy in Colorado who’s doing a high-end bison pet food,” she says.)
As these pet-food start-ups edge their way into the market, many entrepreneurs appear to have concluded that there must be a way to feed dogs and cats without relying on the rendering industry, the surgical procedures of academic research or the detritus of alternative-fuel manufacturing.
They have begun to speak of a pet-food revolution.
According to Nestle, the push to reform pet food is part of the broader movement to transform the way human beings eat.
The pet-food movement “is grass roots, and it is a combination of the so-called good, clean, fair movement, the slow-food movement, the locally grown movement and the farm-animal welfare movement.
These social movements are about changing the industrialized food system,” she says.
The latest trends in pet food emphasize not only natural and organic ingredients but also an increased obligation to identify the precise origins of those ingredients.
Nestle says, “This will place enormous pressure on standard industrialized pet-food companies to say where their stuff comes from.”

Righteous Dog Food retails for $7.50 a pound, compared with around $1 a pound for an inexpensive commercial brand.
Gowdy and Outlaw envision a time when they will sell 12,000 pounds of food each month in the New York metropolitan area, enough to feed 600 dogs — and to make a profit.
For now, demand has outstripped the capacity of Gowdy’s General Electric range, so the partners have begun to prepare their products at an industrial kitchen called Hudson Valley Foodworks, in upstate New York.
A company manufacturing dog biscuits, which, like Righteous Dog Food, only uses human-grade ingredients, has also joined the roster.
On the sweltering morning the partners invited me to visit their operation, Gowdy and Outlaw planned on cooking two 500-pound batches of a chicken recipe and one 500-pound batch of beef-based fare.

“It’s probably too healthy for me,” he said.
If you are what you eat, is it also true that you are what your pet eats?
Tim Phillips, the editor of Petfood Industry magazine, says that animal owners tend to think so, and even more often they tend to think, This is what I like, so my dog or cat must like the same things.

Whether religion, science or business, pet food is booming.
Today about a third of the animal-science graduate students studying at the University of Illinois with George Fahey and other professors devote themselves to nutrition, and according to Fahey the industry brims with job opportunities for them.
“It’s as good a time as ever in the 30 years I’ve been doing this,” he told me.
“This is a very secure building,” he said.

The plugs did not seem to irritate the dogs.
“If it is put in correctly, it becomes part of them,” he said.
“It heals very nicely, and becomes a part of their anatomy.” The ports must be opened and inspected at least once a week and flushed at least once a month, and when Fahey or his colleagues collect samples they simply unplug a stopper, attach a plastic bag and let the dogs run around, which pushes out the digesta.
Clearly, they were begging, but begging for what?
But the Fed’s main weapon for restoring confidence — reducing its benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks to 5 percent or less, from 5.25 percent now — would have little effect on fears about credit quality.

“The reason there isn’t a market for these credits is that people don’t know what price they should be trading at,” said Edward E. Leamer, professor of management at the University of California, Los Angeles, who presented a paper during the weekend at the Federal Reserve’s symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
“That’s not going to be affected by a small change in the federal funds rate.”

The meltdown in credit markets permeated discussions at Jackson Hole.

More important, supporters of a lower fed funds rate say it could prevent the huge looming losses from bad mortgages from expanding into even bigger losses on all kinds of loans.

“It would be a very powerful signal,” said Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Citigroup.
“A critical determinant of housing prices is employment.
If you think employment is going to weaken, your assumption for housing and for the ripple effects through the economy will be very different.”

But economists are still debating whether the Fed created the housing bubble, and thus set the stage for the current bust, when it slashed interest rates to cushion the shock of a bursting stock market bubble.

“It’s too easy to blame the Fed,” said Robert J. Shiller of Yale, who sounded early alarms about both the stock market and housing bubbles.
Mr. Shiller blamed mass psychology for the bubble, an almost ubiquitous conviction that housing prices would simply keep climbing at double-digit rates.
Fed officials have long cringed at the idea of a “Greenspan put,” the idea that former chairman Alan Greenspan could be counted on to rescue financial markets in times of turmoil by cutting rates.

Mr. Bernanke also made it clear he now worries that the downturn in housing and mortgage lending could pose a danger to the broader economy.

“Housing prices should not have a special role in the conduct of monetary policy,” said Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, in a speech at the Jackson Hole conference.
“On the other hand, central banks should be actively prepared to deal with situations as they arise.
You want to be prepared.”

Reducing the fed funds rate would not necessarily rescue people who took on far more debt than they could afford.
Rather, Fed officials appear to hope that the move would stimulate consumption and send a reassuring signal to investors that the Fed is prepared to prevent a full recession.

But the last few years suggest that the overnight fed funds rate has a weak relationship to housing.
Long-term interest rates, which determine mortgage rates, rose slightly before the central bank began raising the overnight rate in June 2004.

But given the collapse of confidence in the credit quality for subprime and near-prime mortgages, which accounted for about one-quarter of mortgage originations as recently as May, few forecasters expect a quick recovery — and certainly not because of a slightly lower overnight lending rate.
In Thursday’s paper, David Pogue reviews the movies-on-demand set-top box service, Vudu.
The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., will start selling its movie box at the end of the month for $399.
The shiny black device plugs into your television and to a high speed internet connection.
Then you rent or buy from a roster of thousands of movies, and start watching any one of them instantly.
The blundit argument has since gotten some corroborating evidence as Apple TV has largely failed to move the market, an unusual misfire for Steve Jobs.
So are Vudu and other set-top-box startups dead on arrival?
I’ll answer the question with another one: Are you satisfied with the television box, and its on-demand services, currently in your home?
I think the blundits underestimate the mounting dissatisfaction with the services being provided by cable and satellite companies.
Many of today’s set-tops are almost famously awful, with poorly designed user interfaces, weakly cloned DVRs, over-worked central processors and confusing remote controls.
For example, get people talking about the Comcast HD DVR box — as John Battelle did here — and you unlock a wave of venom.
People are fed up with the hardware in their living room, particularly as the Internet elevates their expectations for consuming media.
But no one—not even Apple— has yet figured out a way to profit from that unhappiness.
Maybe it will be Vudu.
Maybe it will be the yet to launch Building B, or any of the other Silicon Valley startups that see a market where the blundits see blind alleys.
I have tested the Vudu device for the last week too, and even though my DSL Internet connection is slower than recommended for the service, I have found it to be an absolute pleasure to use.
As the movie selection grows, I can even foresee ditching my Netflix subscription – and finally getting rid of that nasty case of Netflix Guilt.
And getting rid of my Comcast HD DVR box altogether?
I’m just waiting for a good reason.

South Dennis, Mass., Sept. 5, 2007
The final bill, hammered out this week in a House-Senate conference committee, alters many of the ground rules for financing higher education, offering forgiveness on student loans to graduates who work for 10 years or more in public service professions like teaching, firefighting and the police, and limiting monthly payments on federally backed loans to 15 percent of the borrower’s discretionary income.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It also raises the maximum Pell grant, the basic federal grant for middle- and low-income students, to $5,400 from the current $4,310 over the next five years.
To pay for the changes, the bill reduces federal subsidies to lenders by roughly $20 billion over the same period.
“Today we’ll need a similar bold new commitment to enable the current generation of Americans to rise to the global challenges we face,” said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the education committee.
“Today we’ll help millions of students achieve the American dream.”

Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House education committee, said that last year, Republicans took nearly $12 billion from federal student aid programs.
“That’s the difference that an election makes.”

Campaign promises aside, the changes reflect the steep and sudden decline in the fortunes of the $85 billion student loan industry after years of generous subsidies and support in Congress.

Lenders, which had campaigned hard against the subsidy cuts, warned that the reductions would compromise the federal loan program, forcing some of them out of business and reducing competition and, inevitably, services to students.

Kevin Bruns, executive director of America’s Student Loan Providers, said the legislation “punishes the industry,” while Joe Belew, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said it would “come to be viewed as irresponsible legislation that undermined rather than expanded college opportunity.”

Mr. Kennedy dismissed the complaints, saying, “The reality is that our bill restores the balance to this grossly unfair student loan system by directing funds to the students, not to the banks.”

House Republicans, some of whom had received generous campaign contributions from lenders in the past, derided parts of the legislation — particularly the forgiveness of loans for certain professions — as a form of socialism.

Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and a former chairman of the education committee, predicted that the subsidy reductions “will cripple the private sector loan program,” which he credited with bringing “lots of innovation” to students and parents.
“This legislation does nothing at all to reduce the cost of college,” Mr. McKeon said.
“I don’t know how we can treat banks as credible arbiters of what appropriate subsidies should be.”

With the law, Congress is reducing federal subsidies to lenders by roughly $20 billion and gradually halving the interest rate on need-based student loans over the next four years.
Some $11.4 billion of that money will go toward increasing Pell grants.

For the first time, the government will now auction off the right to offer federally backed educational loans to parents state by state, instead of setting the rate from Washington.
The two lowest bidders in each state will win the right to make subsidized college loans to parents.
It is true that a more liquid short-term loan market can give a highly leveraged institution a second chance.
An immediate infusion of cash can be a lifeline for a solvent, but illiquid, company.
But keeping loan markets open is not a bailout; it’s simply getting part of the economic infrastructure back on line, much as the police clear a road after a traffic accident.
Note that when the Fed makes it easier for financial institutions to borrow money, the loan must still be repaid.

Colorful interpretations of recent monetary policy abound, from both commentators and politicians.
Depending on the storyteller, the policy reflects the triumph of the rich over the poor, an atonement for the sins of the Bush administration, a long-awaited comeuppance for the American economy, a continuing hangover from the dot-com bubble, or an inability of the professor (Ben S. Bernanke) to handle a real-world job (running the Fed).
Journalists are especially likely to embrace narratives, if only because their editors and their readers clamor for them.
Of course, if there are enough competing stories, some of them will fit or predict some real-world events, if only because of random luck.
Nonetheless, Fed watchers should resist the tendency to put all events into a simple or a morally plausible narrative.
Monetary policy is a largely technical subject, and its ups and downs don’t usually fit into the kinds of emotion-laden stories that human beings apply to daily life.
The “us versus them” tag registers in human memory, but monetary policy is not always or even usually about moral issues.

In response to this crisis, the Fed has been trying to keep a steady hand and prevent a credit crunch.

Of course, such an account of recent financial history sounds mundane and offers less human conflict.
It’s less like the stories that people have gossiped about for thousands of years and thus will have less traction, even if it is a better guide to monetary policy issues.

Debating Fed policy in terms of strong moral narratives makes it harder for the Fed to do a good job.
For instance, if interest-rate cuts are portrayed as a bailout for hedge fund managers, it’s harder for the Fed to cut interest rates, if that turns out to be the appropriate policy.
It also makes the public wonder — unjustifiably — who else might deserve a subsidy as well.
Both President Bush and Congress are preparing plans to assist homeowners facing foreclosure.
Many of these proposals are political pandering, designed to win votes by easing the pain of homeowners.
Yet someone else is paying the bill, so protecting people from their mistakes in this way does not promote the general public welfare.
In any case, these proposals should be evaluated on their (often slight) merits, rather than seen as a quid pro quo for another bailout already made.
THE American public has a hard-enough time understanding relatively simple economic issues like the benefits of free trade, much less the Fed or monetary policy.
So if the picture sticks that the Fed is a shill for hedge fund managers, or that it is treating homeowners unfairly, the pressure will mount for Congress to limit the Fed’s independence.
Yet most economists, on a bipartisan basis, agree that relatively independent central banks have a better record of maintaining economic stability and keeping down price inflation.
Wealthy financiers and hedge funds make for easy targets, especially when combined with the arcane field of central banking.
But the real moral question is whether we will prove mentally tough enough.
Can we resist the temptation to force financial markets and the Fed into oversimplified moral narratives?
Or will we continue to blame Zeus for lightning strikes?

The question of our mental strength and discipline is also a story — and I hope it has a happy ending.
“Bernanke didn’t really say anything about interest rates, but at this point the feeling on Wall Street is that it’s mandatory,” said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist of Weeden & Company, speaking about a rate cut.
“At this point, the market is pricing in not just one rate cut, but a couple, and that’s helping to stabilize stocks.”

Following are the results of yesterday’s auction of four-week Treasury bills:
The European Central Bank, which initiated the effort on Aug. 9, has added 250 billion euros ($348 billion) to the market, and yesterday it continued its effort by lending 75 billion euros ($104 billion) for three months.
The Federal Reserve and the Japanese central bank have also added liquidity, and on Aug. 17 the Fed cut the rate at which it lends money directly to banks by a half-point.

But the Bank of England has taken only a modest part in this effort, injecting £4.4 billion ($8.9 billion) into the system since the crisis began a month ago.
Instead, it has reminded banks that they can always borrow at a “penalty rate” of one percentage point above a benchmark rate that is now 5.25 percent — a pointed message that those who speculate and lose have to pay some price.
The British bank might be expected to be among the most concerned about the credit crisis because the British economy — and particularly greater London — depends heavily on a financial services industry that is now at the center of the storm.

But some analysts maintain that the bank is relying on measures taken in the United States and at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.
To the extent that British banks need pounds sterling, this view has it, they can simply borrow in dollars or euros and convert them, freeing the Bank of England from the task and allowing it to occupy the moral high ground.

And since most of the mortgage-backed securities are denominated in dollars, the need to borrow in pounds will be limited, analysts said.
Still, Mr. King has turned into the most prominent critic of those in the financial markets who have been clamoring for cheap money.
Such market participants see more liquidity as the solution for investors who borrowed heavily to buy the securities that have lost value.
But Mr. King’s fear is that cheap money will encourage investors to create anew the kind of financial house of cards that is now tumbling down.

To be sure, buying furniture can be fraught with pitfalls, including financing and delivery.
“Shopping for furniture is treacherous,” James Hood, editor of ConsumerAffairs.com, wrote in an e-mail message.
“The only 100 percent sure way to get what you pay for is to buy the items you want off the floor, load them into your truck or van and take them home with you.”

With a little planning, consumers can minimize the potential for bad outcomes by following the advice of the specialists:

RESEARCH Approach furniture buying as you would car buying, Mr. Lewin said.
Research brands and retailers, and examine rankings and quality reports.
Do your homework on the Internet, but don’t necessarily buy there.
If you do, he said, pay with a credit card and make sure you understand the return policy.
ROOM PLANS Raymour & Flanigan and other retailers now offer online room planning tools on their Web sites (raymourflanigan.com).

After registering at the retailer’s site, buyers can save their designs, e-mail them and go to the store and change the plan on a store computer once they see the furniture.
“Design and fit are the major questions they need answered before they buy the product,” Mr. Street said.
Icovia is also working with property managers.

STORE VISIT The biggest mistake people make is they don’t really test how well the item sits, Mr. Lewin, the author, said.
If it’s a couch or chair, sit on it for as long as you can, he said.
“Everybody is in a hurry, but hold off ordering until you can come back and see if it feels good.”

Come prepared with measurements.
“When you’re out spending thousands of dollars, you should have a plan with precise schematics and dimensions,” he said, both square feet and cubic feet to account for higher ceilings.

Don’t just look at the furniture, he said, “heft it,” pick up an arm to see if it’s heavy.
Lighter-weight material might be of lesser quality.
Look at the pattern match.
If the item is a table or dresser made of wood, examine the finish.
Check the drawers and the back panels.
If it has cardboard components, quality may be an issue.

What you see in the showroom may not be what you get, Mr.
To avoid this, he writes, find a furniture warehouse, outlet or resale center that stocks the kind of furniture you want.
“Many of these are open only on weekends.
It might sound silly, but it’s the surest way of getting what you want, and, if you’re careful, can be the most economical way of getting good quality furniture.”

DELIVERY Heeding Mr. Hood’s advice means no problems on the receiving end.
Many consumers write to ConsumerAffairs.com to relate delivery nightmares, he said.

“Delivery problems are horrendous and getting worse,” he writes.
“Deliveries are often late, the crews are often ill-trained, rude and incompetent — and sometimes larcenous.
The furniture that is delivered may not be what you ordered, it may be damaged or it may not fit through the door.

“If any of these occurs, it’s just the beginning of a long series of frustrating conversations with customer service,” he said.
LAYAWAYS AND FINANCING Many stores still offer layaway plans, which allow you to pay off the furniture before it is delivered.
Retailers also have many buy-now, pay-later financing arrangements that are tailored to a consumer’s credit history and financial standing.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Pay cash or use a credit card, Mr. Wood said.
“Layaway or other store-based financing is almost always a mistake.
It’s a good way to lose all of your money, in the case of layaway,” when a furniture store declares bankruptcy or goes out of business.
Financing plans often cost more than consumers expect, he added.
Just like car dealers, retailers lure buyers with no-interest financing over longer periods.
At Raymour & Flanigan, buyers who qualify can finance $1,000 a year, interest free, for up to four years.
Borrowers must make monthly payments, and there is no prepayment penalty.
Still, experts say, if consumers miss a payment on these finance plans or fail to pay off the balance on the due date, they are often hit with double-digit interest rate charges that some stores back-date to the time of purchase.
It is a personal choice, Mr. Lewin says, but still consumers should recognize that they are changing rooms much more frequently today — every couple of years instead of every decade.
If consumers are buying now and paying later, they may need to get rid of the furniture before it is paid off, because of lifestyle changes.
“The smart shopper spends what they can afford.
And there are more lodgings to come.
The most ambitious is a 102-room complex being built just off the road to the town of Novo Airão by the Accor group of France, which is scheduled to open in 2010 and will be the first international luxury chain hotel actually in the jungle; the Hilton company has also announced plans to build a 196-room “eco-lodge resort” near Novo Airão .

For the moment, however, the Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge, which opened in February, is the newest and perhaps the most chic example of the lodge phenomenon.
Operated by a couple from São Paulo, it is on a bluff above the Rio Negro, within sight of the Anavilhanas Ecological Station, a government nature reserve that encompasses the world's largest riverine archipelago, with more than 400 islands and hundreds of lakes and igapós, an indigenous word that means flood forest.
Astonishingly rich in both animal and plant life, the reserve area, which has been designated a Unesco World Heritage site, is unspoiled and uninhabited.
No matter what their location, the lodges tend to follow a certain pattern when it comes to outings.
In the morning, for instance, before the heat gets too stifling, a nature walk is, more often than not, de rigueur; I've seen all sorts of monkeys, macaws and toucans, not to mention sloths and anteaters, on such treks.
Afternoon excursions to fish for piranha provide the kind of bragging rights that delighted my teenage son when I took him with me on an Amazon trip a few years ago.
After dinner, it's often back to the boat to hunt for the Amazonian caiman known as the jacaré.
But instead of carrying guns or spears, guides are armed with powerful spotlights that freeze the reptiles in position and make it possible to remove young ones from the water so that guests can run their hands over their cool, ridged carapaces.

All can arrange an excursion for you to witness the “meeting of the waters,” the spot just southeast of Manaus where the Rio Negro's dark waters converge with those of the Amazon's other major tributary, the Solimões.
I've stopped there at least a dozen times and never cease to be amazed at the way the two great rivers, markedly different in color and temperature, collide with such force and volume that they seem to be fighting each other.

But each lodge also tries to offer something its competitors do not.
For instance, the Amazon Ecopark Jungle Lodge, 40 minutes from Manaus, is famous for its “Monkey Jungle Reserve.” Here, woolly monkeys, some confiscated from contraband dealers, others injured, are monitored at a rehabilitation center on the lodge grounds.

At the Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge, a group of more than a dozen botos, or gray dolphins, show up daily to be fed at nearby Novo Airão.
A motorboat from the lodge takes guests to a floating restaurant alongside the main dock there, where a pet anaconda circulates among customers sipping chilled beers or soft drinks.
As we stood on a raft attached to the restaurant, the dolphins cavorted, sticking their long snouts up from the water for pieces of fish tossed their way or seizing fish snacks from tourists intrepid enough to go into the water.
“If we'd let the botos, they would spend the entire day here, just eating,” said Marisa Grangeiro de Almeida, whose family operates the restaurant.
“But the environmental agency and the university scientists have established fixed feeding hours.”

The Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge has its own strict rules when it comes to the guides it employs.
Most lodges rely on freelancers who come in from Manaus.
The Anavilhanas lodge hires only residents, which quickly pays off for the visitor.

That is important because the sheer abundance of wildlife on view can be staggering, especially as one gets farther away from Manaus.
I have never seen as many birds, for example, as I did two years ago at the Pousada Uacari, which is situated inside the Mamirauá nature reserve, 350 miles west of Manaus at the confluence of the Solimões and Japurá Rivers.

Like several of the new lodges in the region, the Pousada Uacari is not on land, but sits on floating rafts at a bend in the river.
Here guests can view wildlife in remarkable proximity.
After dark, for instance, I could see caimans, some as large as eight feet, their eyes glowing like orange lanterns; some came startlingly close, banging against the dock and making querulous grunts, a symphony that continued through the night.
There is even a lodge that is literally up in the trees.
One of the oldest and by far the largest of the jungle lodges, it has been visited by celebrities like Bill Gates and the King and Queen of Spain.
All 269 rooms are up in the jungle canopy, as much as 60 feet above the river, and connected to one another and the dining hall and common areas via aerial walkways.

Only one lodge that I know of can claim to be on the Amazon River itself.
The Amazon Riverside Hotel makes the most of that distinction, offering excursions to see the sun rise from a century-old British-built navigation beacon in the middle of the river; it also has a nature trail that leads to a hilltop observation post with a commanding view of both the jungle and the river, and has arranged hammocks at the dock for guests keen on doing nothing but watching the river flow.
Just to remind guests where they are, the Amazon Riverside's reception area, built around a lagoon, displays the outsize skulls of an adult caiman and a toothy onça, the Brazilian cougar.
Lined up near the dining area is a series of jars with pickled remains of some of the animals that have been found on or near the hotel grounds: poisonous snakes, scorpions and spiders, including a giant caranguejeira, or crab spider.

The owners of the Amazon Riverside are members of Manaus's flourishing Japanese community, which migrated to the region nearly a century ago to work on jute and pepper plantations.
The Tsuji family caters to Japanese tourists, an effort that is reflected in an innovative menu that includes dishes such as sashimi of tambaqui, a prized Amazon game fish, and tempura made with okra and abóbora, the Brazilian equivalent of pumpkin.

The piranha fishing there was extraordinary.
Many lodges organize visits to the homes of people who live nearby, at the river's edge in houses usually on stilts.
Known in Portuguese either as caboclos, a term equivalent to hillbilly, or more respectfully as ribeirinhos, or river dwellers, they have limited incomes and little contact with the rest of Brazil.

To the river dwellers all visitors seem impossibly well-off.
But luxury, of course, is a relative concept.
The reality is that it is tremendously difficult and expensive to bring in fuel, food and other supplies by boat, and no Amazon lodge I've visited would ever qualify as a five-star resort.
You are, after all, in the heart of the Amazon jungle, and your accommodations, no matter what they might lack in grandeur, would have been the envy of the area's first European explorers.

VISITOR INFORMATION

HOW TO GET THERE

Until mid-2006, getting to Manaus from the United States was a cumbersome process that often involved flying to Rio or São Paulo and then doubling back.
But Brazil's TAM Airlines (www.tam.com.br) now operates a daily five-hour flight from Miami.
A round trip in late September or October starts at $1,025; Copa Airlines (www.copaair.com) also has flights from $969, but those include a stop in Panama.

WHERE TO STAY

The packages mentioned are per person and include three meals a day.
Except as noted, transportation from and back to Manaus is also covered.
The Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge (55-92-3622-8996; www.anavilhanaslodge.com) has been open for only about six months, and is perhaps the most elegant lodging in the Amazon.
It has 16 air-conditioned, wood-paneled rooms decorated with regional art, and an open-air common area stocked with DVDs and books.
The minimum two-night package is 950 reals total, or $475 at 2 reals to the dollar.

Unlike most other new lodges, the Amazon Riverside Hotel (55-92-3622-2789; www.amazonriversidehotel.com), which opened in 2002, is 40 minutes downstream from Manaus, not upstream.
As a result, transportation to the hotel includes a visit to the site where the Rio Negro and the Solimões join to form the Amazon.
There are 15 rustic apartments, with fans but no air-conditioning.
The one-night package is 625 reals; the hotel also offers a day-use option for 250 reals.
The main lure of the Pousada Uacari (97-3343-4160; www.uakarilodge.com.br) is its privileged location, in the Mamirauá nature reserve about 90 minutes by speedboat from Tefé, which is on the banks of the Solimões River.
There are 5 floating wood cabins, offering a total of 10 rustic apartments, with water for the showers and sinks coming directly from the river.
The minimum three-night package of 1,000 reals a person does not include transportation from Manaus to Tefé.
In a competition for most unusual setting, the Ariaú Amazon Towers (55-92-2121-5000; www.ariau.tur.br) would win hands down.
Just off the west bank of the Rio Negro, its 269 rooms, some with air-conditioning, and trees growing through them, are up at the level where monkeys live.

Less than an hour from Manaus by boat, the Amazon Ecopark Jungle Lodge (55-21-2256-8083; www.amazonecopark.com.br) has 64 rooms and 3 bungalows, a beach on the Rio Negro and a pool.
At 11 a.m. and 5 p.m., there are opportunities to feed the monkeys.
One night is 720 reals.
WHEN TO GO

“In September, October and November, the water levels are quite low,” said Wedson Franklin Santos, a guide who works at the Amazon Riverside Hotel, “so you get to see all the exuberance of the wildlife,” which is forced out into the open.
He added that during the middle of the year, when the flood plain is starting to recede, “the attraction is more the landscape itself and not the animals, which are mostly in hiding.”

STAYING HEALTHY

Most doctors recommend a program of antimalarial medicine, beginning several weeks before arrival and continuing during a trip.
(I stopped taking such prophylactics because of the unpleasant side effects, and besides, there is now a drug-resistant strain of malaria.)
But there are other measures one can adopt to reduce the risk of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue.
Rather than going outdoors with arms exposed, for example, wear a long-sleeve shirt made from a lightweight fabric.
And do your best to avoid being outside during the period local people call “the malaria hour,” about 5 to 7 p.m.
And whether home prices begin falling noticeably or merely stagnate for years until incomes catch up, it’s clear that the real estate bust has become the dominant force in the economy.

Earlier this year, Robert J. Barbera, who’s been a Wall Street economist for 25 years, was predicting a soft landing for housing — that is, stagnation rather than substantial declines.
“But now it appears that’s not the way we’re going to do it,” says Mr. Barbera, the chief economist at ITG Hoenig, who correctly predicted yesterday’s Fed move.
What has changed in recent weeks are the spike in mortgage rates, the drying up of subprime lending and the ever-growing number of houses on the market.
It’s also worth looking at what happened to home sales last month in California, where counties release property transaction records earlier than they do in most of the rest of the country.
In the Los Angeles area, 35 percent fewer homes sold this August than in August 2006, according to an analysis by DataQuick Information Systems.

The exact path that housing prices will take over the next few years is, obviously, unknowable.
But there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that the typical home last year was overvalued by something like 20 percent.
I wouldn’t necessarily argue with anyone who insisted on 15 or 25 percent.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The reason it may not be bigger is that mortgage rates remain a good bit lower than they were for much of the last generation.
But they’re not so different as to suggest that home prices have returned to rational levels.

The scariest part of a national decline like this is that it could be more like 40 percent in some parts of the country.
That’s difficult to fathom — and, in fact, construction would probably come to a halt in those places, cushioning the price drop locally and, by extension, a bit nationally.
But 40 percent is not out of the question in a few places, like the southwestern coast of Florida.
Remember that all of these declines are relative to income or inflation.
The median house price nationwide has already started falling since last year, according to the S.& P./Case-Shiller Index, the most accurate measure.
If actual prices were to fall 10 percent over the next year or so and then do nothing for the following five years, that would add up to about a 20 percent decline, adjusted for inflation.
This would be a big deal.
It would lead to lost jobs, less consumer spending and slower economic growth.
It would be the worst housing downturn on record.
It’s hard not to notice that the latest round of grim news has come in the same week that Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke’s predecessor at the Fed, is making the rounds of talk shows to promote his new memoir.
Mr. Greenspan has long defended his inaction during the housing boom, particularly his decision not to crack down on out-of-control mortgage lending, by saying that bubbles are extremely difficult to recognize until after the fact.

I don’t know, though.
This one didn’t seem so subtle.
Now Mr. Bernanke has to deal with its aftermath.
So do the rest of us.
Analysts said a decline in the cost of goods used to make other goods, known as intermediate goods, signaled that price increases were slowing further up the production chain and that consumers might see some relief as those goods are processed and enter the retail market.
Together, the reports suggest to some analysts that inflation worries will not stand in the way of future rate cuts.
The Dow Jones industrial average, keeping pace with its 335-point gain from yesterday, was up 94.05 points, or 0.7 percent.

Still, the threat of inflation has not dissipated, with some analysts pointing to the 0.2 percent increase in core consumer prices and a similar gain in the core Producer Price Index.

“I think it’s a bit of a mistake to assume that the inflation genie has been put back in the bottle,” said Michael T. Darda, chief economist for MKM Partners, a research firm based in Greenwich, Conn.. Mr. Darda argued that this month’s plunge in oil and energy costs have skewed inflation figures, providing a falsely reassuring snapshot of the current retail market.

But other observers saw this morning’s report as a sign of stabilization.
“There is no clear sign of deceleration in the core,” said Per Gunnar Berglund, a senior economist at Moody’s Economy.com.
“We expect it to stabilize around 2 percent going forward.” Referring to personal consumption expenditures, another inflation gauge, he added, “Our take is that the core P.C.E.
price will decelerate somewhat further in the coming months and that the core C.P.I.
will remain where it is.”

Restrained inflation could help ease the effect of the turmoil in the housing and credit markets on the broader economy.
While the fallout has been relatively modest so far, some consumers are becoming more cautious.
Whether that leads to a modest economic slowdown or a full-blown recession will depend on several variables, primarily employment and consumer spending.

Consumer spending was aided by the housing boom, especially in states like California, Florida, Arizona and New York, but there are few signs that the ensuing housing slump will abate soon.
Those figures fell short of analysts’ expectations.
Residential housing projects were down 2.6 percent in August, continuing a downward trend over the last few months.

“I think with most writers their neurosis is finishing things,” she said.
“I have a different neurosis.
Then I become really difficult to live with.” So ingrained is her completion complex that, after switching majors from literature to dramatic writing, she went back and finished a half-completed degree in Victorian melodrama.
Her husband, Jess Lynn, a former stage manager whom she met in college and married in 1990, once told her, “You’re like the opposite of Dorothy Parker, where you love writing and hate having written.”

But Ms. Rebeck stumbled upon the subject matter of “Mauritius” while she was avoiding work.
I found that mysterious and moving — why that thing would satisfy your spirit in a deep and meaningful way.”

The play is about two half sisters who inherit a possibly valuable stamp collection and the three male philatelists who want to get their hands on it.
“The stamps mean something desperate to all of them,” Ms. Rebeck said.
“In some ways the stamps mean life to them.
I’m a believer that all of us are broken in some way, and there’s a hole in our heart that we pour our own destruction or our children or our stamp collection into.“

Ms. Rebeck seems to share with her protagonists a strong sense of right and wrong.
Her characters frequently pay for their principles.
“The Family of Mann,” a comedy she has sometimes called a “documentary,” is largely an exposé of the wounds she suffered in the trenches of television writing, with which she has extensive experience.
While she still writes the occasional pilot, she said she’s substantially absented herself from that world, calling it “a bit crackers for someone like me”

There are plenty of tales of Hollywood in “Free Fire Zone,” her recently published “writer’s guide” to working in film, television and theater.
In it she relates, with comic aplomb and barely concealed fury, a few dozen terrifying war stories from her nearly 20 years in the business.
She censors herself only to the extent of renaming figures with names like Caligula, Napoleon, Richard III and Satan.

Mr. Hughes, who recently started reading the book (“I hope I don’t end up in Volume 2,” he said), observed: “Theresa does not — and I commend her for this — she does not make nice for the sake of making nice.
She’s a believer that pathologies and tainted motives and overreaction are important to expose.
She sees that as her job, and it damn well is her job.

Ms. Rebeck said she wrote the book as a “don’t kid yourself” answer to the many young writers who ask her for advice.
But the tone of the book matches her plays, the simultaneous search and demand for values and decency.
“I think Theresa’s plays are about how to behave morally in today’s world,” said Will Frears, who directed the New York productions of “Omnium” and “The Water’s Edge.” “How is that possible?”

Ms. Rebeck herself put it more simply: “I don’t ever write about an amoral universe.” That, apparently, would not be interesting.
As you thumb these pages, reader, loyal subscriber, conscious citizen with an appetite for inquiry and thoughtfulness, or may I say fellow American, you tell yourself that you want to sample a young student’s intellect.
Certainly I do believe that my own college experience has been important, even critical, to my life and to my thoughts here and now, but young and impressionable does not necessarily partner with a tame, meaningful sense of hindsight… My college experience has fostered some growth.
But for the nation?
Lend me some relevance.
Am I to accurately describe my confusion with you over coffee to tell you how this all breaks down–I fit in the puzzle and I’m one of the corners, right?
Politics.
We don’t have movements, and we don’t have causes.
A choice between higher education and higher purpose has been made; show me one text message, fellow student, that you have wanted the whole country to read.
Children live at school.
Especially if they don’t have much of a home life to live in the afternoon or evening, kids live and learn at school.
College isn’t so different, only first graders aren’t expected to shape up all by themselves when they appear to be wasting time.
Oh, college students aren’t either?
Pity.
I guess higher education isn’t all that important.
Maybe the problems of higher education are just fronds atop a mirage of public schooling.
Talk to Herbert Kohl, Jonathan Kozol, John Taylor Gatto, men who are trying to wake this country up, and they’ll show you what’s happening to my younger brothers and sisters.
Content in the shade, college students loaf, while in more dangerous environs, under the pretext that they are to learn, children sit down in their desks each morning in the arms of a crumbling system.
In college, we choose to sleep in, not to participate, excel, regress, etc.
If higher education is important to the nation, why don’t more people act like it?
Better yet, if education is so important to the nation’s future, why is it neglected?
Important as it is, I feel proud to remember the words of Thomas Jefferson, who often can remind us of politicians’ and citizens’ true responsibilities: “It is highly interesting to our country, and it is the duty of its functionaries, to provide that every citizen in it should receive an education proportioned to the condition and pursuits of his life.” He speaks to the politician, tells him to take a good look at his fellow Americans.
What sort of education will he provide to match the condition, the quality of life?
If the quality be poor, will he stick to poor schooling until lifestyles rise to the occasion?
Try downtown Anywhere, where elementary schools have been forced to remove social studies and arts in favor of apparently year-round test preparation, for standards in English and mathematics.
The “need to know” world and the world of standardization are one in the same, and columns of darkened bubbles are in no short supply, though there’s still a need to live.
Speaking of letters and numbers now, I can admit to the usefulness of text messaging, at least as a pursuit of happiness.
Last I checked, the pursuit of happiness is a right, along with life and liberty, all-redeeming, not measurable in proportion, because it is a right.
So let’s point happiness in the right direction, because happiness can come quickly to college students.
Given the privilege of a college experience, the high school graduate will face a myriad of choices, many that will contribute to a direction in life, maybe the chance to make a difference.
I readily despise the would-be friends who, at the mention of “making a difference,” or “doing some good in the world,” pack up their brains and make for Complacency, where a mature air of timidity is key.
My own confusion lingers; I have the notion that “to whom much is given, much is required,” and so what puzzles me is how damn much we’re not doing, socially, obviously.
It’s alright that we have unique campuses, communities unto ourselves, as prideful and pompous as the bookstores are expensive.
Just give me some sign that I am not alone, learning, trying to make my life an act of gratitude toward those who made my freedom.
I am not a Republican, nor a Democrat, yet, nor particularly knowledgeable about most politics.
Yet I am a citizen, and I vote.
You see that I am concerned about public education–simply because I have heard, read, and seen some alarming things–rightly, as any other man has the right to be fed up with anything else.
Oftentimes I carry on politically flavored conversations with parents and teachers, and they quickly degenerate into a trail of complaints about the education system.
Then when someone leaves the room scratching his head, it gives me as much satisfaction as scratching my own.
I know, that when I make an impression, I am part of democracy.
Rick Perlstein notes “bucolic images of a mystic world apart, where 18-year-olds discover themselves for the first time in a heady atmosphere of cultural and intellectual tumult.” This is precisely the atmosphere that does the yanking, and for that reason it is critical.
Today there are still brilliant individuals, we all meet them, ready to take on all manner of activities to satisfy their interests and appetites for learning; they likely are continuing their good pursuits.
For the popular majority, it is appropriate, though not by any means necessary, to bloom in freshman year of college and not before.
It’s the same thing as high school, just no parents.
Wait, yes parents, every minute on speed-dial.
If college really mattered, freshman year would be imagined as absolutely different, totally transporting.
“Cast your eye over America.
Who are the men of most learning, of most eloquence, most beloved by their countrymen and most trusted and promoted by them?
They are those who have been educated among them and whose manners, morals and habits are perfectly homogeneous with those of the country.”

Jefferson again.
No, not thinking of a great tribe of conformists, but rather of those who have an eye for what is needful, people who trust in the progress of the nation and the world, not the progress of their own interests.
OK, maybe there is a texting movement…I may have a backward view, being a student and not a statistician.
Nevertheless I think college students are primed to do the best things in the world, and so they should act like it.
In the face of modernity and its distractions such potential is hard to see.
When we get over our pride and see it, imagining the country and the pace of all things changing, and at once the future seems at stake in our hands, then college will matter.
A key reason is the mounting risk of a recession in America.
The bursting of the sub-prime mortgage bubble — strikingly reminiscent of the dot-com excesses of the 1990s — could well be a tipping point.
But the lessons of post-bubble adjustments are clear.
Just ask economically stagnant Japan.

Sadly, the endgame could be considerably more treacherous for the United States than it was seven years ago.
In large part, that’s because the American consumer is now at risk.
Consumption expenditures currently account for a record 72 percent of the gross domestic product — a number unmatched in the annals of modern history for any nation.
This buying binge has been increasingly supported by housing and lending bubbles.
Yet home prices are now headed lower — probably for years — and the fallout from the subprime crisis has seriously crimped home mortgage refinancing.
With weaker employment growth also putting pressure on income, the days of open-ended American consumption are likely to finally come to an end.
That will make it hard to avoid a recession.

Fearful of that possibility, foreign investors are becoming increasingly skittish over buying dollar-based assets.
The spillover effects of the subprime crisis into other asset markets — especially mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed commercial paper — underscore these concerns.
Foreign appetite for United States financial instruments is likely to be sharply reduced for years to come.
That would choke off an important avenue of capital inflows, putting more downward pressure on the dollar.

The political winds are also blowing against the dollar.
In Washington, China-bashing is the bipartisan sport du jour.
New legislation is likely that would impose trade sanctions on China unless it makes a major adjustment in its currency.
Not only would this be an egregious policy blunder — attempting to fix a multilateral deficit with more than 40 nations by forcing an exchange rate adjustment with one country — but it would also amount to Washington taxing one of America’s major foreign lenders.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That would undoubtedly reduce China’s desire for United States assets, and unless another foreign buyer stepped up, the dollar would come under even more pressure.
Moreover, the more the Fed under Ben Bernanke follows the easy-money Alan Greenspan script, the greater the risk to the dollar.
Why worry about a weaker dollar?
A sharp drop in the dollar makes those items considerably more expensive — the functional equivalent of a tax hike on consumers.
It could also stoke fears of inflation — driving up long-term interest rates and putting more pressure on financial markets and the economy, exacerbating recession risks.
Optimists may draw comfort from the vision of an export-led renewal arising from a more competitive dollar.
Yet history is clear: no nation has ever devalued its way into prosperity.

The Scene

Hermann is steeped in wine culture, with eight wineries within a 20-mile radius.
Some are cottage industries, growing grape vines the way their neighbors grow grass.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The wineries bring tourists who stay in the region’s more than 70 bed-and-breakfasts, nose around the antiques shops and buy authentic German sausages from the Swiss Meat Market 12 miles south of town.
Local residents are more often found downing a burger and a Bud at the Barrel.
Those with a taste for elegance and a beverage that isn’t Busch-bred are better off at restaurants like Europa, whose name sums up its menu; the Vintage, where the German food is good but the Stone Hill wines are better; and the Cottage, which has a limited menu but a lush hilltop setting.
Hermann also officially celebrates its German roots.
On the third weekend of May, there’s Maifest, which focuses on dancing, parades and crafts.
Octoberfest brings four weekends of wine tours, music and food, and in December, the town features a traditional German Christmas market.

But for Mr. Dierberg, the town is not just about German wines and German heritage, it’s about the way it looks.

“Mainly, it’s the buildings that do it for me,” he said.
“But it’s also the way the hills sit against the water, and how they come down into the valley.
I can be driving out of St. Louis, and I might be in a hurry and talking on the phone, and even if it’s cloudy, I come into this valley and it’s like the sun comes out, and everything’s nice.”

Pros

Unlike the Ozarks several hours south, the Hermann hills have no water parks, music theaters, casinos or magic shows — just rambling woods cut by fields, white-fenced horse farms, brick farmhouses enveloped in ancient trees and wineries.
And its residents like it that way.
Cons

Being nestled in a crook of the wide Missouri has two major disadvantages: Hermann is steamy in summer, and the low-lying areas near the Missouri River and its tributaries are susceptible to flooding after heavy rains.
Cultural and arts events are scarce, and to take in something in St. Louis is a 160-mile round trip.

Jim Grebing, Hermann’s tourism director, said: “It’s not really a child-friendly place in that instead of water parks, we have wineries and bed-and-breakfasts.
And many of the bed-and-breakfasts don’t take children because of the antiques and breakage and so forth.
On the other hand, many of the people who go to the bed-and-breakfasts go there to get away from the kids.”

The Real Estate Market

With little building going on, old houses trump new ones in Hermann.
Compact three-bedroom cottages deliver four-season views of the river and low upkeep for $150,000.
A furnished B & B-ready cottage is listed for $169,900.
Roughly 10 percent of the housing stock in the area are second homes, according to Mr. Grebing.

The median price for a house in Hermann is $170,000 to $180,000, said Judy Warden of Warden Real Estate.
Recent sales include a four-bedroom house that was built in 1941 for $88,500.
Unusual for Hermann, which likes to consider itself the anti-Branson, a development of five second homes, each one on 32 acres, is being built on the other side of the river around an artificial lake.
Jeff Kelly, a builder from Chesterfield, near St. Louis, who is on the development team (and is building his own second home), said, “We figure it’ll be removed from the sprawl of St. Louis for another 15 or 20 years.”

Speaking of the development, Mr. Kelly added: “The wine-country aspect adds to the appeal tremendously.
Plus the culture, plus the rolling Midwestern countryside, plus the occasional alpaca farm.”

Even so, Katy Wehrle, a broker with Wehrle Real Estate, said: “It’s slow right now.
Interest rates have held things back, and gas prices haven’t helped.
But even with that, people who have a 6,000-square-foot home in St. Louis are buying a 1,500-square-foot home in Hermann.
They see it as a steppingstone to get them to where they really want to be.”

She added, “This has always been a well-kept secret in that regard, but I think its days as a secret are about done.”

Even in the United States, the market’s return has been led by sectors like energy, industrials, materials and technology, which investors believe are best positioned to take advantage of the growth abroad.

The analogy for the technology sector in today’s market is housing, the engine that has been driving the economy for nearly a decade.
Like the tech boom, the housing boom turbocharged the performance of not only the real estate industry, but also dozens of related industries — mortgage lenders, construction firms, building-supply companies, appliance and furniture makers.
The rising value of houses also allowed homeowners to make frequent withdrawals from home equity A.T.M.’s, cash that they often spent on remodeling, vacations or buying sport utility vehicles.

But now it has done just that, taking more than the home builders down with it.
The housing slowdown is hurting all the industries it helped on the way up, and home equity withdrawals have turned into mortgage defaults.

Can the subprime mortgage damage remain contained?
It could.
But one could make a compelling case that it will ultimately ripple through the economy until it hits consumer spending.

If it gets that far, most companies will suddenly be under pressure and will respond by trimming spending (advertising, salaries, jobs).
And if that happens, the “virtuous cycle” that powered the expansion will have reversed, and the resulting profit crunch will take the market down with it.
Moving back in history, other crashes have played out in slow motion, too.

Will they save the market?
Perhaps.
But despite what the recent euphoric market move may make you think, stocks don’t always soar after rate cuts.

African Violet Flowers

Q. I have always kept my African violets in a somewhat shaded western window.
I use the same food and don’t understand where the flowers have gone.
How can I bring them back?
A. African violets need at least 10 hours of bright but diffused light to bloom.
Southeast or west facing windows are better than direct sun, except in the dead of winter.
It sounds as though the non-blooming plants have been watered and fed but not otherwise tended.
If that is the case, they are almost surely too crowded.
And if they have not been repotted yearly they are overdue for a change.
African violets prefer a very light, freely draining growing medium.
Packaged soil labeled for African violets is seldom porous enough.

With financial markets skeptical that the Bush administration wholeheartedly backs this policy, the message has barely altered the euro’s upward trend against the dollar.

One month after it abandoned a planned increase in borrowing costs in the face of credit market chaos, the European Central Bank gave little indication of when — or if — it would resume lifting its benchmark rate.

Under the treaties that created the euro, the bank’s chief priority is to fight inflation, which is now edging above 2 percent because of higher oil and food prices, slightly above the bank’s comfort zone.
Over the last two years, the bank has steadily raised rates to ensure that accelerating growth does not lead to a spiral of rising prices as companies pass on the costs of more expensive raw materials to consumers or bid up the price of labor amid falling unemployment — dangers that Mr. Trichet said were still very much present in the euro area.
In its monthly statement, the bank did drop a reference to interest rates being “on the accommodative side,” a sign that it has finished tightening credit.
But Mr. Trichet repeatedly emphasized that the bank “stands ready to act” to ward off higher inflation with higher rates, even though it is clearly pausing to gather more information about the effects of the credit squeeze.

“As long as they are concerned about inflation, it doesn’t really matter how they characterize their stance on interest rates,” said Elga Bartsch, an economist with Morgan Stanley in London.
“But they are on hold for now.”

One reason the bank may have altered its trajectory on interest rates is that credit markets have done the bank’s job for it over the last two months, economists said.
As nervous banks and investors have curbed their lending, they have forced up the cost of borrowing, effectively creating the tighter credit conditions that central banks use to keep inflation under control.

Still, the bank has to preserve its options in case the outlook for inflation worsens — an entirely plausible event given escalating oil and commodity prices — while bearing in mind that higher interest rates could worsen the credit squeeze and hurt manufacturers and other companies.

The picture in commercial paper is similar.
The outstanding volume of asset-backed commercial paper — often issued by companies whose own credit is less than sterling — continued to rise during the early part of the credit crisis.
In the last eight weeks, almost a quarter of the asset-backed paper has been redeemed.

But the outstanding volume of other commercial paper, which is more likely to be issued by companies with solid credit, has begun to rise again after falling for several weeks, another sign that the credit freeze is thawing.

For banks, meanwhile, the loan books have swelled, in some cases against their will.
Many banks had issued promises to finance loans if securities could not be sold.

THE experience at Swoon Kitchenbar in Hudson begins before you even enter the restaurant.
Pots of flowers and herbs — sage, lemon thyme — line the ramp up to the entrance, enveloping you in a kind of tunnel filled with the sights and smells of nature.
It’s the perfect preparation for the food to come, which is startlingly fresh and beautifully presented and, despite its sophistication, tastes close to the earth.
Swoon Kitchenbar marries the best of city-based training with the advantages of Hudson Valley ingredients acquired within miles of this Columbia County restaurant.
The result is worth a detour during a weekend drive, or even as a destination in itself.
The restaurant is the three-year-old effort of Jeff Gimmel and his wife, Nina Bachinsky-Gimmel.

Q.
We see the pizza-size dishes used to pick up satellite TV signals, so how does that stubby, pencil-size antenna on my portable G.P.S.
receiver get information from a satellite in orbit more than 12,000 miles up?
A.
The global positioning system receiver is pulling in a much simpler set of data, said Alan J. Friedman, consulting senior scientist for the New York Hall of Science.
“Since it is all digital, that’s a lot of numbers which must be transmitted and received every second, and the receiver’s dish antenna has to pick out those numbers from the electronic noise all around us.”

The G.P.S.
receiver needs only two small sets of numbers from each of four or more satellites: the time on a super-precise clock in each satellite and the position of that satellite.
The time on each satellite’s clock will appear to have tiny variations from satellite to satellite because of their motion as they orbit the Earth, Dr. Friedman explained.
“Those tiny differences, and the positions of the satellites, are fed to a computer chip inside the G.P.S.
receiver (programmed using relativity theory) to calculate where the receiver must be on the Earth,” Dr. Friedman said.
“Anyplace else on the Earth, the numbers would have been different at that moment in time.”
The current rate chasers are of all ages and means, although no one tracks their numbers and demographics.

Like their day-trading predecessors, rate chasers are all online.
“Rate chasing has never been easier than in the last two years, because of the Internet and personal finance sites like Bankrate.com that have aggregated listings of providers chomping at the bit to get your business with the highest rates,” said Edward Woods, a senior analyst at Celent, a financial services research and consulting firm based in Boston.
Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said, “There’s a big disparity between letting money languish in a low-yielding account at your typical brick-and-mortar bank where the average passbook savings account is less than 1 percent and the high-yield accounts, where they top 5 percent.
”

But, he added, “whether it makes sense to chase every little change in rates depends on how much money you have to play with.”

The roots of online rate chasing go back to 1996, when NetBank, the first significant Internet-only operation, offered savings rates that were higher than any on a brick-and-mortar passbook account, so long as savers were willing to open an account at a bank with no physical branches.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Then, in September 2000, ING Direct, an online division of the Dutch banking giant ING Group, offered a 6.5 percent savings rate at a time when passbook accounts in the United States were averaging 1.66 percent, according to Bankrate.com.
Although there were smaller online banks offering the same rate or a little more, ING Direct had the resources to pay for a huge national advertising campaign featuring a distinctive orange ball.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Today, the bank still has roughly half the $150 billion in online deposits in the United States, according to Mr. Bruene, even though it has not offered the highest rates in recent years.
Rate chasing really began to take off in January 2005, when the online bank Emigrant Direct came on the scene with a 3 percent savings rate, topping ING Direct, which was offering 2.35 percent at the time.

In March 2006, Citibank introduced its online brand, Citibank Direct, with a 4.5 percent savings interest rate.
“When it’s Citibank, that gets the attention of every large bank.
If they hadn’t been thinking of starting an online brand before, they were then.”

Today, there are some two dozen major online-only banking brands in the United States, most of them divisions of regional, national and global banks, Mr. Bruene said.
All use high rates to attract new customers to whom they can peddle more profitable products like checking accounts and loans.

“When banks choose to lower those high rates to improve their bottom lines, they do it knowing some customers — namely, the rate chasers — will move on,” Mr. Bruene said.

“This is not a rate game we are playing, it’s a long-term plan,” he said.
“Like other regional banks, we are on the defense against giant banks coming into our American plains and buying up branches.
The Internet has allowed us to go national without opening branches, and this is our effort to position our bank in an industry that will be totally online in 10 to 20 years.”

Through September, FNBO Direct attracted 36,000 new accounts with total deposits of $1.5 billion, Mr. Johri estimated.

Three weeks into its 6 percent rate, FNBO Direct imposed a $1 million limit on new deposits.
“We did not want a handful of people using our bank for a short period of time,” Mr. Johri said.

Those over their limits probably believe the federal government will protect them, Ms. Warren said.
“People remember that during the 1980s savings and loan crisis, it didn’t let depositors who’d exceeded their limits go down.”

Ms. Warren added: “Although many savers are sophisticated enough to understand the stock market is the place to be long term, they believe its fundamentals are crazy now and they cannot tolerate the risk.
I’m one — my husband and I got out this summer and put our money into C.D.’s.”

Even investors with no plans to exit the market are sedately chasing online.
Warren Wagner, 66, a retired government bond dealer and seasoned individual investor from Tahoe City, Calif., currently has 40 percent of his holdings in cash as he waits to resume active trading later this year.
For the cash in his portfolio, he bids online for C.D.’s at Zions Direct, a division of Zions Bank of Salt Lake City.
“I am getting the highest safe yield I can right now,” he said.

At the other end of the spectrum are chasers using borrowed credit card money, which Ms. Warren called “odd risk-taking behavior.” But it makes sense to Mr. Ferris, the software engineer who depends on his money management software to be “the biggest rate chaser out there.” He said he had gains of $9,000 before taxes since he started chasing rates two years ago.
Many were considering C.D.’s, previously heresy for pure chasers accustomed to being able to take advantage of competing banks’ rates.
“Why put your money in the market when you can have a 9.36 percent sure thing?” Mr. Ferris asked.
“In seven months, it’ll be time to chase rates again, and who knows where they’ll be by then.”

The dollar bills, directing people to a company Web site, will also be handed out in New York.
Virgin Money USA will offer personal and business loans, mortgages and reverse mortgages.
The average interest rate for loans is 6 percent, and for mortgages, 5 percent.
Borrowers are charged a $9 per payment administrative fee and will pay an upfront charge ranging from $99 for unsecured loans to $2,000 for large mortgages.
Borrowers can select terms of their loans, including the duration and rates.
The bank will not retain any of the interest.

Will the highly influential but largely silent leadership of New York City’s great cultural institutions, long prevailed upon to avoid biting the hand that fed it, now feel free to speak out openly against the harm wrought by Altria (formerly Philip Morris) everywhere it does business?
Will we see, at long last, an end to hush money in the guise of support for the arts?

Branford, Conn., Oct. 9, 2007
New data on the economy presented a mixed picture Friday, providing little guidance for investors ahead of the Federal Reserve board’s meeting next week to consider a possible interest rate cut.
Inventories continue to move higher, with home builders now saddled with 8.3 months’ worth of unsold supply.
“This was on the whole another quite weak report, particularly given the aggressive price-cutting that homebuilders have been implementing in order to try to reduce inventory,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, in a research report.
David Kovacs, senior portfolio manager at Turner Investment Partners, finds the figures heartening.
The heavy use of buybacks shows him that executives are optimistic about their stocks.
“Insiders know what they’re doing,” he said.
“If they’re net buyers, it means they’re bullish.”

Pete Kendall, co-editor of The Elliott Wave Financial Forecast newsletter, says Mr. Kovacs may be giving executives too much credit.
“I tend to think of it as another sentiment indicator,” he said of buybacks.
“Just as investors get more bullish as the market rises, company officers get caught up in their own share price.”

Mr. Kovacs conceded that the issuance figures may not be as compelling as they seem at first, but for a different reason.
Companies may be making liberal distributions to shareholders, but they have not been turning down money when it is offered to them.
Extremely low interest rates on loans and bonds have made debt financing far cheaper than issuing stock; some companies, in fact, have borrowed to finance buyback programs.
Net debt issuance is at record levels, a $600 billion annual rate, as equity issuance has hit bottom.

THE math that made borrowing so appealing changed months ago, however, when lenders yanked credit from the shakiest borrowers and raised rates on all but the soundest ones.
That may reduce the money available to finance buybacks and private equity deals, which often involve borrowing to acquire the equity in a targeted company.

It may also drive companies to sell stock instead of tapping bankers or the bond market.

He played down the importance of buybacks, which he sees as a substitute for conventional dividend payments — and a less rigorous one at that.
Companies can buy back shares, or not, whenever they feel like it; dividend payments represent a firmer commitment to pay shareholders, he said.
He added that payout ratios, that is, the percentage of earnings disbursed as dividends, are close to a record low.

Mr. Kendall considers the growth in buybacks a negative because it indicates that companies cannot think of anything better to do with their cash than to return it to shareholders.

Shrugging off spiking crude, traders bought stocks yesterday in expectation of an interest rate cut by Federal Reserve policy makers at their meeting beginning today.
Investors say a cut could provide relief from problems in the housing and credit markets and help counter the risk that expensive energy, by pinching consumers’ pocketbooks, will lead to a downturn in overall spending.
Consumer spending is a major component of domestic economic growth.

But Fed bankers, who are wary that an aggressive cut could lead to inflation, might instead see surging oil costs as a harbinger of higher prices as producers who pay more for energy pass the costs on to the consumer.

Some analysts and economists expect the Canadian dollar to go past $1.0614 soon, the highest level it has achieved since Canada become an independent nation in 1867.
The Canadian dollar has now risen almost 70 percent since its low of 61.79 cents in 2002.
Some of the increase is attributable to high prices for Canadian energy and mining exports.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.38 percent, from 4.40 percent.

Adding to the woes, Chrysler said later in the day that it would cut 11,000 more jobs, suggesting that the housing slump and higher oil prices were continuing to take a toll on the domestic auto industry.

“People are getting nervous looking to the holiday season,” said Anthony Conroy, head equity trader at BNY ConvergEx Group.
“People are going to be spending less because they’re paying more for oil and mortgage payments there.”

Historically, almost every country dependent on the export of oil has answered this question in the same way: badly.
It may seem paradoxical, but finding a hole in the ground that spouts money can be one of the worst things to happen to a nation.
With one or two exceptions, oil-dependent countries are poorer, more conflict-ridden and despotic.
OPEC’s own studies show the perils of relying on oil.
Between 1965 and 1998, the economies of OPEC members contracted by 1.3 percent a year.
Oil-dependent nations do especially badly by their poor: infant survival, nutrition, life expectancy, literacy, schooling — all are worse in oil-producing countries.
The history of oil-dependent countries has produced what Terry Lynn Karl, a Stanford University professor, calls the paradox of plenty.
Oil not only creates very few jobs, it also destroys jobs in other sectors.
By pushing up a country’s exchange rate, the export of oil distorts the economy.
“Oil rents drive out any other productive activity,” Karl says.
“Why would you bother to produce your own food if you could buy it?
Why would you bother to develop any kind of export industry if oil makes your money worth more and that hurts all your other exports?” The most successful societies develop a middle class through manufacturing; oil makes this extremely difficult.
Oil concentrates a country’s wealth in the state, creating a culture where money is made by soliciting politicians and bureaucrats rather than by making things and selling them.
Oil states also ask their citizens for little in taxes, and where citizens pay little in taxes, they demand little in accountability.
Those in power distribute oil money to stay in power.
Thus oil states tend to be highly corrupt.

II.
Venezuela is a typical victim of the oil curse.
It has become a rich country of poor people.
Teodoro Petkoff has seen Venezuela through booms and busts.
Once a daring leftist guerrilla who in 2006 was briefly a candidate against Chávez, he publishes a newspaper, Tal Cual, that criticizes both Chávez and the opposition.
“The state is hypertrophic here, a monster complex on top of society, heavy and corrupt.
It has been the great contractor, the great buyer, the great provider, the great receiver.
To win government is to get access to a source of personal enrichment.
Money has to pass through the state.
Oil has weakened our collective morality.
It obliges you to be corrupt.
You can’t do business if you are not corrupt.
We are waiting for the easy deal, big winnings.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Chávez has promised to break this curse, to finally use Venezuela’s oil to benefit its people.
Oil is everything in Venezuela; it pays for at least half the government’s expenditures and 90 percent of its foreign exchange, according Orlando Ochoa, a prominent economist.
Now “zero misery” is one of the government’s slogans, and the vehicle to get there is oil.
Chávez’s oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., or Pdvsa (pronounced peh-deh-VEH-sah — S.A. stands for “sociedad anónima,” or incorporated), is proudly inefficient, proudly political.
Chávez has called his revolution “oil socialism.”

“We are doing what the old regimes didn’t do,” Bernardo Álvarez, Venezuela’s ambassador to Washington and a former vice minister of hydrocarbons in the Ministry of Energy, said to me.
“We are putting oil into a sustained process of development.
Our first priority is a fight against poverty and exclusion.”

To that end, Pdvsa is investing the company’s profits in helping dropouts finish high school and not just in drilling wells.
“Perhaps it was better run before Chávez,” says Roger Tissot, a Latin America analyst based in British Columbia who works for PFC Energy.
“But it wasn’t efficient in meeting the needs of the shareholders — the people of Venezuela.
Today perhaps it is less efficient but better at meeting social goals.”

Whether this is the right decision turns on whether this policy is sustainable.
Today, oil money feeds and educates poor neighborhoods.
The purpose of the national oil company is not to produce more oil, but to produce Bolivarian socialism.
These are two very different ways to handle a nation’s oil resource.
Can either model show poor countries how to convert natural resources into sustained wealth?
Few questions in economic policy are more important today.

III.
Many nationalized oil companies are poorly managed — on average, national companies are 65 percent as efficient as private ones, according to one study.
Still, it is possible to have a stellar national oil company, efficient in the classic sense, one that can compete favorably with any Western major.
Saudi Aramco and Petrobras, in Brazil, are two examples.
Szabo now runs a software company in Houston, but until 1983, he was a high-level executive at Pdvsa.
Except for the destination of the revenues, nothing.
Literally nothing.
Venezuelans demanded that the profits stay at home.
“To keep it healthy you must leave it alone.
Because wells run dry and machinery ages, oil companies everywhere must invest lots of money just to keep production steady, and to grow, they need even more.
Without new investment, Pdvsa would lose 25 percent of its oil production every year.
“But I think the priority has to be to maintain oil.
If you have one dollar left, it should be invested in keeping capacity.
Otherwise next time around you will not have a single dollar to distribute.”

Espinasa, now 55, lives in Washington and works as an energy consultant to the Inter-American Development Bank.
The bulk of Venezuela’s oil lies under a 4,500-square-mile savanna called the Orinoco Belt.
The reserves are enormous, but 20 years ago it was not clear that they would be commercially viable.
It required expensive technology and expertise to extract, and even then only a small percentage of the oil could be recovered.
This crude also needed a special refining process and would most likely sell at a discount.

To ensure there would be a market for Orinoco crude, in 1982 Pdvsa began to buy refineries overseas able to process it.
By the end of the 1990s, Pdvsa was among the top three oil refiners in the U.S. “With heavy oil, if you don’t own a refinery, your production does not have a home,” Szabo says.
“If you own a refinery, you have market share.” And Pdvsa in the 1990s was focused on maximizing its market share in the United States.

Pdvsa executives also decided they didn’t want to take on the debt and risk of developing the Orinoco, so in 1989 they began to open it to private participation.

In hindsight, these were brilliant business decisions.
Pdvsa’s refineries overseas are making record profits, and the United States is the company’s biggest customer.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In fact, some of Pdvsa’s shrewd business decisions seem to have been made with an eye to shielding its gains from the government.
Economists on the left who are critical of the old Pdvsa argue that the foreign holdings allowed the company to play with costs and profits.
It could sell oil to its refineries at less than market price — thus incurring lower taxes.
Pdvsa’s resources and talent outshone that of the Energy Ministry, which was supposed to be overseeing it.
“When the I.M.F.
“At the ministry,” Álvarez says, “we had gone from 200 engineers to 25.
One energy minister used to call it ‘the Empire.’ ”

Pdvsa won virtually every argument.
But many people, not just Chavistas, would argue that Venezuela lost.
“It was normal for people working for Pdvsa to be very proud — it was recognized as one of the best oil companies,” says Tissot, the oil analyst.
“In contrast, the politicians were making a mess managing the rest of the country.

“It shouldn’t have,” he replied.
Ten years later, Pdvsa is no longer an oil company, at least by Espinasa’s standards.
It now exists to finance Chávez’s transformation of Venezuela.
The integration is illustrated by the fact that Rafael Ramírez, the minister of energy and petroleum, is also president of Pdvsa.
“The Pdvsa that neglected the people and indifferently watched the misery and poverty in the communities surrounding the company premises is over,” Ramírez has said.
Chávez travels a lot.
Foreign presidents who receive him may enjoy receiving his customary gift — a replica of the sword of Bolívar.
But they probably appreciate even more the oil that sometimes comes with it.
Chávez provides discounted or free oil to Central American and Caribbean countries, sending nearly 100,000 barrels a day to Cuba in exchange for doctors and Cuban expertise on state security.
He has given millions in non-oil aid to various Latin American countries, much of it in the form of energy projects.
Citgo says it gave $80 million in heating oil to poor residents of the South Bronx last winter.
Pdvsa is also subsidizing Venezuela’s domestic oil consumption.
The Venezuelans feel it is their oil; why should they have to pay for it?
But the subsidies are much deeper and the quantities greater today.
A gallon of gasoline costs 6.3 cents at the pump at the unofficial exchange rate.
And Venezuela is now gorging on gas.
Venezuela will add 450,000 new cars this year — about four times the number of four years ago.
Six Hummer dealerships are set to open early next year.

Oil is now used to create electricity.
Some of Venezuela’s electric plants used to burn natural gas, but gas production has dropped, creating shortages that oil is filling.
Domestic consumption of oil has reached at least 650,000 barrels a day, according to Venezuelan economists.
Venezuela is importing oil products and may soon have to import gasoline.
There is also the problem of contraband: subsidized gasoline smuggled out and sold at world-market prices in Colombia and the Caribbean.
Between its domestic consumption and its use of oil to make friends overseas, Venezuela gives away or subsidizes a third of its production.
Most of the rest is sold in the United States.

The money that Pdvsa does get from selling at market prices goes to finance Chávez’s revolution at home.
Last year, Pdvsa’s payments to the state totaled more than $35 billion, counting taxes, royalties and direct support for social programs.
This is 35 percent of the company’s gross earnings.
Almost $14 billion is spent at the sole discretion of Chávez.
It is called social-development money, although it appears that there is little “social” in some of its spending.
Much of the money goes to the Fund for National Development, or Fonden, an off-budget fund controlled by Chávez, which also takes foreign reserves from the Central Bank.
What Fonden actually buys, for how much, from whom and through what process is a mystery.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The more celebrated of Pdvsa’s projects is a network of social programs, called misiones.
These missions bring health clinics and classrooms directly into poor neighborhoods.
They are financed and in some cases run directly by Pdvsa.
“Today, the president gets on the phone with Ramírez and in an hour can get $200 million.”

To finance all these ambitious projects, Pdvsa must produce oil.
Theoretically this should not be a problem.
(Venezuela crude trades at slightly under the average OPEC crude price.)
Chávez is the beneficiary of the greatest oil windfall the world has seen, one based in part on political upheaval in Iran, Iraq and Nigeria but also on a surge in demand from China and India that is unlikely to end soon.
So, for the foreseeable future, there should be money for everything.

Yet Pdvsa is in trouble.
V.

One good way to see Pdvsa’s many challenges up close is to look at the mystery of the missing drilling rigs.
A rig has two jobs: to drill down in auspicious spots to look for oil, and to clear out working wells when they clog, like a giant Roto-Rooter.
Because oil is so profitable and people are drilling madly, there is a global shortage of rigs, and the price of renting them has gone up.
But Venezuela’s shortage is worse than elsewhere.
But according to Baker Hughes, the Houston firm that provides the world’s standard count of rigs, there are only 73 active rigs in Venezuela.
Rig procurement is going badly.
Vierma called this “a silent sabotage by multinational companies.”

Others might call it the market at work.
Rigs are in high demand; rigs cost at least $15 million, and an offshore rig can cost more than $95 million.
Why go to Venezuela?
“The big contractors want to take their rigs somewhere with less risk and threat of confiscation,” one executive of a big drilling contractor in Venezuela told me.
“The way this government talks, it sends investors running.”

I went to Lake Maracaibo to see the problem for myself.
Maracaibo is South America’s largest lake, a huge basin of duckweed and sewage, where significant oil drilling first began in the 1920s.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Driving down the lake’s eastern shore one hot, rainy morning, I passed Pdvsa’s Maracaibo complex.
In 1997, there were 57 rigs working on the lake.
I saw more rigs, including seven in Pdvsa’s yards, along the lake shore, docked along the bank.
“Why aren’t they out on the lake working if there’s such a shortage?”

Like others I spoke with, he didn’t want to be identified.
“I estimate that there are about 22 rigs sitting idle around the lake, but not all of them are operable, due to lack of maintenance, or because they require additional equipment,” he told me.
But it’s not clear that Pdvsa can do the work at all.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I counted at least 10 rigs belonging to Pdvsa that were not even being worked on — the company’s management is so poor, contractors said, that it cannot coordinate getting rigs repaired.
Pdvsa is responsible for servicing all rigs working on the lake.
“You need a boat to come out to give you water, diesel, empty the cuttings, take away waste,” one contractor said.
“But I’ve waited a week for them just to take trash off the rigs.” There may be other reasons there are few working rigs.
Vierma himself was briefly being investigated by the National Assembly — notable, given that it contains no opposition members — for overseeing the purchase of rigs from companies that supposedly had no rigs, no experience and little capital.
VI.
Pdvsa’s administrative troubles can be traced back to one of the biggest threats to Chávez’s presidency.
Pdvsa has since replaced the strikers, though the new hires are largely inexperienced.
In fact, Pdvsa now employs 75,000 workers, many more than in the past, and Chávez says he wants to increase the number to 102,000 next year.
Part of Chávez’s new “oil socialism” is to make Pdvsa more self-sufficient, reducing dependence on outside service companies.
So Pdvsa is creating new subsidiaries.
One is a new oil-services unit — “our own Halliburton, ours, the ‘Bolivarian’ one,” Ramírez, the energy minister, told state TV.
Pdvsa has also announced plans to build oil ships and drill rigs.
In June, Pdvsa approved the creation of seven new subsidiaries, including ones to grow soybeans for ethanol, to build food-processing plants and even to make shoes.
Pdvsa is running a parallel state.
The company’s workers must all have at least one qualification: they must be Chavistas.
The company is “red, red from top to bottom,” he said.
Pdvsa also wrote a letter to its contractors, warning them not to hire any of the 18,000 fired workers.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

As Pdvsa has been molded to Chávez’s will, it has also become less and less transparent in its dealings.
The company used to publish a standard annual report, but after 2004 it stopped filing its annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In recent years it has released only a page or two of basic figures, with no breakdowns or auditors’ notes.
When Pdvsa does release information, some of it is of questionable credibility.
Even the most fundamental operational fact — how much oil Venezuela produces — is subject to debate.
Today, Pdvsa claims the country produces the same amount, but independent sources, including OPEC, say that figure is too high; OPEC puts Venezuela’s production at 2.4 million barrels a day last year.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

What is clear is that much of the oil revenue is going to social spending.
Last year, Pdvsa says it spent nearly $14 billion on social programs.
That includes the missions and Fonden, but does not include taxes and royalties of $21 billion paid to the government.
Pdvsa says it put $5.8 billion back into the company last year.
While this is a $2 billion hike from 2005, it most likely includes items that no one would call investment in oil; a secret addendum to the 2007 budget described “investment” as including money for national infrastructure and social projects.
Pdvsa’s own business plan calls for rapid growth in production, but oil analysts say the company is clearly not investing enough.
According to Pavel Molchanov, who studies oil in Houston at Raymond James, a financial services company, Pdvsa has had two years of production decline and is likely to have at least two more.
“This is against a background of global oil production increasing 1 to 2 percent a year,” he says.
“If they were spending enough would their production be down?
I don’t think so.” (I would have liked to have asked Ramírez about this and many other matters.
Pdvsa is also taking on debt.
The company had very little debt until 2006, but this year it has borrowed $12.5 billion.
While raising cash through debt offerings can be fiscally sound, and many companies do so, critics contend that Pdvsa is issuing bonds for the wrong reasons.
“Their debts are low, but they didn’t have any before,” says José Guerra, formerly chief of the research department of the Central Bank, who left in disagreement about Chávez’s economic policies.
“Other oil countries are getting rid of debt.
And what is the debt going for?
Their spending on exploration is almost nothing.
They are taking on debt to have a party.”

Some of the private companies that the old Pdvsa had brought in are still working in Venezuela, but they are now only minority partners and are paying higher taxes and royalties.
On May 1, foreign companies working in the Orinoco were told to cede majority control of their projects to Pdvsa.
Two companies, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, left and are now negotiating with Venezuela about compensation.
Other companies, seemingly chosen for their geopolitical value, have come into the Orinoco to take their place and develop virgin areas: national oil companies from big producers like Russia, China, Brazil and Iran, but also Cuba, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina and Belarus, which presumably can bring little expertise to the business of heavy oil.

VII.
Pdvsa is now dedicated to creating a new oil product: it is turning petroleum directly into math problems.
Caraballo, who is 32, lives in the El Encanto section of La Vega, a slum on the side of one of the steep mountains around Caracas.
He is a committed Chavista and a committed socialist.
“Money should serve people and not the other way around,” he told me.
There were 11 adults, some with young children, in the room, studying the addition and multiplication of fractions.
The students — known in the program as vencedores, or triumphers — all had workbooks, and they had already watched a 45-minute video of a math lesson.

This was an eighth-grade class of Misión Ribas, a program that brings grades 6 through 12 to barrios around the country.
This class meets from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. every weeknight in Caraballo’s house.
The videos come from Cuba, and facilitators like Medina lead the class in discussion and exercises afterward.
The vencedores study math, Spanish, history, geography, science and English, and must work together to do a community project, like building a staircase or planting a vegetable garden — that’s the part Caraballo guides.
Not only is school free but most of the students also receive stipends of $85 a month to attend.
The students themselves choose who gets the stipends, based on need and dedication.

Ribas is one of an ever-growing list of Chávez’s missions.
One teaches people to read.
Another has imported thousands of Cuban doctors and dispatched them to poor neighborhoods around the country.
Another set up stores in barrios that carry basic foodstuffs and medicines at highly subsidized prices.
Another provides identity cards to undocumented citizens.
The vast majority of the financing comes straight from Pdvsa.
The missions are popular and have benefited more than half of Venezuela’s poorest sector.
“It comes to our barrio,” one student said.

Spending oil money on schooling and doctors for the poor seems, intuitively, like the right thing to do.
“This is an investment in human capital,” argues Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning Washington policy group.
“You’ve had a focus on food and health care and education.
It doesn’t cost that much, and it’s reaching a lot of people.”

The Venezuelan who finishes high school with Misión Ribas may not have the same education she would get in a formal school.
But without Ribas, she would have no high-school education at all.
Chávez cares about reaching zero misery, something that can be said of few governments with oil.
But no one really knows if the missions are actually moving Venezuela toward zero misery; the programs have no visible internal evaluation.
Increasingly, the missions are replacing their formal counterparts.
It is wonderful for poor neighborhoods to have health clinics staffed with Cuban doctors — wonderful, unless you happen to need the services of one of Venezuela’s hospitals, which are falling apart.
Political and ideological training, Ribas officials told me, is the top qualification for a facilitator.
The referendum, to be held on Dec. 2, proposes changing the constitution to remove Chávez’s term limits and increase his power among other things.
She urged students to attend marches and street demonstrations supporting Chávez.
“Chávez is someone who comes along every 100 years,” she told them.

VIII.
Venezuela’s poor have become much less so under Chávez.
The population living in extreme poverty, measured by cash income, dropped from 20.3 percent in the last half of 1998 to 11.1 percent in the last half of 2006, according to official statistics.
But an oil boom might be expected to alleviate poverty.
The real question is whether the gains will be sustainable.
Weisbrot says he thinks they will.
He points to the missions and figures there are gains in health and education that cash income doesn’t measure.
But so far there is no sign of them: the percentage of those living without running water and living in inadequate housing, as well as the number of young children not attending school, has scarcely budged in the last 10 years.
And this is according to government statistics.
It is early, but these numbers may mean that the missions are mainly helping through the stipends.
Whatever success the missions have at helping the poor may be dwarfed by the grotesque distortions in the economy as a whole.
Inflation is officially at 16 percent but is most likely higher, according to Orlando Ochoa, the economist, who is usually critical of Chávez.
He says that in the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation, just under half the items are sold at government-controlled prices.
Many goods simply can’t be bought at those prices, and consumers must pay double the price in a street market.
Or the goods can’t be found at all, their producers forced out of business by price controls.
One proposal in Chávez’s constitutional referendum could increase inflation much further by abolishing the autonomy of the Central Bank and giving the president power over Venezuela’s international reserves.
The proposal would also essentially allow Chávez to print money.

The major threat to the economy comes from the exchange rate.
Farms and factories are in trouble.
They can’t export and must compete at home with products imported at the official exchange rate, which is now about a third of the market rate.
And so the country is awash in artificially cheap imported products, from basic foodstuffs, like Brazilian cooking oil, to fancy cars.
“Our productive capacity is too weak to create jobs,” Petkoff says.
“But we consume like a rich country.”

The disparity between the official exchange rate (2,150 bolívars to the dollar) and the black-market rate (6,200 bolívars at press time) has created a new class known as the Boliburgesía.
Bankers, traders, anyone who works in finance or commerce, can get very rich manipulating the exchange rates.
Buy all the imported whiskey and Hummers you want, is the message.
Live a life of wild excess.
Just don’t try to produce anything.
Even if the price of oil stays high, it may not be able to sustain Venezuela if oil production continues to drop, subsidized domestic consumption keeps rising and government spending continues unmeasured and unchecked.
While other oil producers, like Russia and Nigeria, are piling up surpluses, Venezuela is spending everything it gets.
Venezuela once had a $6 billion oil fund to be saved for lean years; Chávez has spent all but $700 million of it.
The vast majority of Chávez’s new missions and worker cooperatives are dependent on state handouts — unsustainable when government revenue falls.
A devaluation of the currency would wipe out the income gains of the poor.

This is classic oil curse, and Venezuela has seen it before.
Chávez has quite likely intensified these cycles, and the country is less able to produce anything other than oil.

Venezuela’s adventures in oil nationalization have produced two very different models.
But the new way has produced something arguably worse — economic failure despite a boom in oil prices, and it is unfair to future generations.
IX.
Nationalization is often a response to the failure of privatized oil to respond to the people’s needs.
Even in the United States, where there is a good chance of getting caught, oil companies have inflated their costs or illegally deducted costs and engaged in other machinations to minimize payouts.
For poor countries, the risks of getting a raw deal from private oil companies are much greater.
History is littered with contracts that give Big Oil obviously unfair advantages — Shell in Nigeria, Mobil in Kazakhstan and Texaco in Ecuador to name a few.
Oil can also be an irresistible seduction to a country’s ruling class.
Where democratic institutions — or even merely transparent processes — don’t exist, the lure to corruption is powerful.
In Equatorial Guinea, ExxonMobil, Amerada Hess, Marathon and others made payments to President Teodoro Obiang or his family for land, security and other services, according to a Senate investigation of money-laundering involving Riggs Bank, where some of those payments ended up.

Nationalization, however, doesn’t cure these ills, and it can deprive a nation of its rightful take of its natural wealth in other ways.
One is simply lack of know-how.
One reason President Evo Morales of Bolivia pulled back from his threats to radically nationalize the country’s gas industry is that Bolivian officials realize they cannot manage the business themselves.
Morales has focused on raising royalties on fields with known reserves, fields where companies essentially are guaranteed a return on investment.
Morales’s nationalization rhetoric, not royalty rates, made private companies skittish.
“There are intangible factors I can’t control, and it’s creating all this political risk.” Roger Tissot of PFC Energy adds: “Companies don’t have a problem paying more rent and taxes.
They do have a problem giving up control.”

So perhaps the best strategy for resource-rich countries is to keep the oil private, watch it carefully and tax the hell out of it.
Better yet, raise royalties, which are more straightforward and easier to collect.
“If your objective is to maximize rent, then the best way is to have companies compete with one another in open bidding for access,” Tissot says.
“Angola and Libya have done this very successfully.
Libya invited private companies to come back and is squeezing 90 percent of the profits out of them.”

As a slogan, “Negotiate a Better Royalty Rate!” doesn’t have the ring of “The Oil Is Ours!”; nationalization of natural resources can bolster a country’s psyche even if the management of those resources is a failure.
The urge to nationalize is, at its core, a political one.
Chávez seized Pdvsa not so it would produce more but so he could directly control the money.
When governments give into this urge, they tend to be susceptible to the temptations of using oil for short-term gain.
But not always.
Nationalized oil production doesn’t necessarily lead to political corruption or shortsightedness.
If the old Pdvsa were operating in today’s booming oil market, there might be plenty of money for investment in oil and social programs.
But it would be the government’s job to watch the company closely to make sure the state got its fair share — in other words, to ensure oil does what it should do: produce maximum sustainable money for the state.
It’s also the government’s job to use the money wisely.
That is a more important and difficult problem than the dilemma of whether to nationalize, and the solution does not depend on whether production is nationalized or privatized.
It is not even an oil problem at all.

All oil production ends up at some point in the realm of politics — whose interests will the bounty serve?
The only way to mitigate the political influence is transparency for state-owned and private companies alike.
“There should be a law that a national oil company has to publish its corporate figures, matching an S.E.C.
filing,” says Jaffe, the Baker Institute fellow.
“We recommend that there be a regulator in Parliament that requires full reporting.
And it should be open to the public.
It’s easy to say and hard to do.”

Private companies do release credible annual reports — but many of them never reveal what they pay host governments.
Several new nongovernmental campaigns, like Publish What You Pay and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, are trying to shame companies and governments into bringing the books out into the open.
So far they have had limited success.
“The problem isn’t who owns the resources, it’s what you get from the proceeds,” says David Mares, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego, who studies energy in Latin America.
“If you waste it in corruption and unsustainable programs, it’s as bad as if you have international corporations dominating, who pay very few taxes.”

Nationalization won’t keep oil from being stolen.
Good oversight, accountability and management of the funds will, no matter who owns the oil.
“Guess what?
But an examination by The New York Times shows that many of those goals went unfulfilled as the agency slowly collapsed under its own mismanagement, wasting money and failing to provide services.

And the city, Miracle Makers’ biggest client, shares some of the blame.
One of the largest of those organizations, Miracle Makers moved far beyond foster care to provide everything from doctors and drug treatment to housing for the homeless, serving more than 5,000 children and adults in 32 programs across Brooklyn and Queens, and building a national profile.
Yet the city let it continue for three and a half more years, feeding it additional millions as its evaluations remained dismal, its finances derailed and its children suffered.
For much of that time, the man with the ultimate say over the agency’s fate was Mr. Scoppetta’s successor, William C. Bell — a former top executive at Miracle Makers.

Today, Miracle Makers has lost most of its state and city contracts, though the city still pays it more than $7 million a year for day care and AIDS services.

Miracle Makers executives, past and present, denied any wrongdoing by the agency.
The son of an Alabama coal miner, he was cleaning subway cars at night and rehabilitating brownstones in the 1970s when he helped his Pentecostal church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, start a handful of thriving day care centers that eventually became The Miracle Makers Inc.

He had no experience in foster care when the city asked him to start taking neglected children in 1986.
“This is an exhilarating time for us,” wrote Mr. Wren, a dapper man with the inspirational skills of a preacher.

Asked to help, Mr. Wren immediately set up an emergency nursery.

Of all the new agencies, the city seemed especially impressed with one.
“Miracle Makers and Willie Wren, in particular, have indeed been justifying their name,” said a 1988 memo by Mr. Brettschneider’s successor, Brooke Trent.

Mr. Little, who has since died, said he was trying, in part, to save money.
“The city does not have the means to know what is happening in foster care,” he said in a news article.
“We’re heading for a serious crisis.”

The Board: On the Sidelines

If city officials would not hold Miracle Makers to strict account, someone else could: a seasoned, skeptical board of directors.

Yet for his board, Mr. Wren chose friends, church leaders and business associates — many of whom were devoted to the agency’s work but short on experience and independence.

The agency was staffed in much the same way.

Mr. Wren says he kept the board fully informed.

“I don’t need to travel to Brooklyn to have chicken,” she recalls another new director saying.
“We’re not doing anything.”

While the board sat by, millions of dollars poured in, and the agency’s blue awnings popped up all over as it expanded into what Mr. Wren called “wraparound services” to bolster families: a program to work with parents to keep children out of foster care; help for AIDS patients; and housing for teenagers and the mentally retarded.
In 1997, records show, the city’s health department canceled a contract to provide housing and services for about 40 tuberculosis patients, saying Miracle Makers had failed to file fiscal reports or give required care.
The state’s health department had a more basic concern.
In 2000, after reviewing a report on Miracle Makers’ finances, it questioned whether the agency could survive another year.
“Please submit a plan to ensure continued solvency,” the department wrote.
“We turn into a multimillion-dollar agency overnight, with no additional training for the staff, no additional training for the management,” Ms. Johnson said.
“And if you look at the résumés of the people in place, you ask yourself, ‘Do these people run a $35 million corporation?’ Your answer is resoundingly: ‘No.
Hell, no.
They can barely balance their checkbook.’ ”

The City: Moment of Truth

The alarm sounded even louder in City Hall.
The team’s report, delivered to Mr. Wren and his board, was unsparing — a 35-page portrait of an organization riddled with fundamental flaws: huge caseloads, high turnover, a staff poorly trained and supervised, an agency too busy “putting out fires” to plan for children’s futures.
The team’s recommendations were blunt: The agency’s “aggressive expansion” must stop, and Mr. Wren must prepare to step down.
Mr. Wren, who criticizes the report today as superficial and inaccurate, left the agency nine months later.
would discontinue doing business with Miracle Makers,” he said.
Mr. Bell had worked at Miracle Makers for four years in the early 1990s, eventually overseeing foster care and other programs.
In November 2001, two months after the Courtney report’s harsh conclusions, he spoke at a Miracle Makers fund-raising dinner, praising Mr. Wren and tracing his own success to his days there.
“I stand here today,” he said, “really being a miracle of birth out of Miracle Makers.”

Mr. Bell declined several requests for an interview.
“There had to come a time when something has to be done.”

Miracle Makers’ board of directors, too, was eager for change — finding a successor to Mr. Wren to lead the agency in a new direction.
Mr. Wren, he said, “was astute enough to realize that he had to use elected officials who work within the area.”
