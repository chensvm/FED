The ranking Democratic member of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, plans to ask the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a county prosecutor in Ohio today to explore "inappropriate and likely illegal election tampering" in at least one and perhaps several Ohio counties.
The request for an investigation, made in a letter that was also provided to The New York Times, includes accounts from at least two county employees, but is based largely on a sworn affidavit provided by the Hocking County deputy director of elections, Sherole Eaton.
Among other things, Ms. Eaton says in her affidavit that a representative of Triad Governmental Systems, the Ohio firm that created and maintains the vote-counting software in dozens of Ohio counties, made several adjustments to the Hocking County tabulator last Friday, in advance of the state's recount, which is taking place this week.
Ohio recount rules require that only 3 percent of a county's votes be tallied by hand, and typically one or more whole precincts are selected and combined to get the 3 percent sample.
After the hand count, the sample is fed into the tabulator.
If there is no discrepancy, the remaining ballots can be counted by the machine.
Otherwise, a hand recount must be done for the whole county.

Ms. Eaton contends that the Triad employee asked which precinct Hocking County planned to count as its representative 3 percent, and, upon being told, made further adjustments to the machine.

"This is pretty outrageous," Mr. Conyers said.
"We want to pursue it as vigorously as we can."
Over the past 14 years, I have had hundreds of conversations with parents about high school sports careening out of control.
In virtually all of them, the reaction has been the same -- approving nods of solidarity, followed by my own queasy sense that they weren't really listening to a word I said, their own private SportsCenter moment reeling in their heads for their sons and daughters.
Over those 14 years, the excesses have only gotten worse.

As USA Today reported in October, millions upon millions of dollars are being spent on high school football stadiums and related buildings across the country.
Texas, of course, leads the arms race with new or pending high school football stadium projects in the Dallas area alone costing close to $180 million.
But in Jefferson, Ind., as part of a privately financed $8 million building project, there's a new 6,000-seat high school football stadium with an expensive video scoreboard.
In Valdosta, Ga., $7.5 million was spent to renovate its football stadium, including building a museum to the glory of the Valdosta Wildcats.
The arguments for these sports centers are as familiar as they are wearying as they are transparent: the football programs not only are self-sustaining but also support other sports; these are stadiums the community wants so there's no harm, particularly when they are privately financed.

But no community, at least no community I would want my children to live in, can justify any of these monoliths.
In an age where educational resources are dwindling, how can the building of a lavish new stadium or a field house possibly be justified, much less needed?
What does it say to the rest of the student body, the giant-sized majority who do not play football, except that they are inferior, a sloppy second to the football stars who shine on Friday night.
How can a community brag about its ability to get financing for a multimillion-dollar football stadium when it can't conjure up the money to hire more teachers that would lead to the nirvana of smaller class sizes?
If it's the desire of boosters to pour money into sports, and it usually is, then why not use these private funds for a physical education program to reduce obesity among teenagers?
IT isn't simply money that has contributed to the professionalism of high school sports.
As a reporter for The Chicago Tribune, I spent a year uncovering abuses in Illinois as disturbing as anything in Texas -- high school coaches recruiting eighth-grade players with glossy pitches and come-ons straight out of the major-college mold, parents getting so many calls from high school recruiters that they simply had their phones turned off, high school basketball coaches siphoning off Chicago's best players just so they wouldn't compete against them.
Jump a level down into that emotional hell known as travel team -- there isn't a parent of a travel team player who can't recite at least one horror story of another parent going berserk or a coach flipping out in the name of providing 10- and 11- and 12-year-olds with a little extra competition.

In October, the National Association of State Boards of Education issued a report calling for greater oversight of high school athletics because of the alarming trickle-down of virtually every bad college practice.
The list of concerns included steroid use, shady shoe agents, mercenary coaches, dubious recruiting tactics and extravagant gifts.
Steroid abuse does exist in high schools.
As many as 11 percent of the nation's youth have used them, according to a study by the Mayo Clinic.
Based on other research, some of the most disturbing users are freshman high school girls, with a rate of abuse at a minimum of 7 percent.
"We have a moral obligation to prevent the exploitation of high school students," the national association said.

Those are important words, but I'm afraid they are going to fall on deaf ears.
Sports as an institution is every bit as powerful in this country as corporate America or the Catholic Church.
Yet sports are still considered a sidelight, ancillary to our daily experience.
It's still too easy to put on those rose-colored glasses, indulge in Grantland Rice images of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame and Knute Rockne speeches of winning one for the Gipper.
It's too easy to get wrapped up in the supposed character-building elements of it, the false narratives of heroes and come-from-behind glory fed us by newspapers and television networks and cable networks in their ceaseless search for easy emotional aphrodisiacs.
Which means that high school sports will continue to fester into shameful overemphasis in too many places, will continue to emulate the college sports model that is America's educational shame.
Which means that by the time we completely ruin the institution of sports for our teenagers, it will be too late to do anything except appoint a national commission to try to figure out how we could have missed so many warning signs.

"As far as I can tell, there is no economic significance to writing off $9 billion," Mr. Posner said.
"It's an effect of arbitrary accounting choices."
As a result, regulators will probably not force Fannie Mae to sell off large chunks of its portfolio -- the sort of action that could disrupt the mortgage market and cause interest rates to rise, said Brian Rohman, managing director at Weiss, Peck & Greer, an institutional investor.

"I think everybody involved accepts that there's a lot at stake and they need to manage the situation," Mr. Rohman said.
"They don't want Fannie Mae to be in a position where they have to dump a lot of mortgages and push up yields."

Instead, regulators may force the company to gradually reduce its size over the next few months, recognizing that Fannie Mae's mortgage portfolio naturally erodes because homeowners prepay mortgages when they move or when interest rates fall.

The regulators could also force Fannie Mae to strengthen its capital base by finding new investors to buy shares or preferred stock.
The capital is the cushion of cash that Fannie Mae has to shield bondholders from losses if its portfolio of mortgages loses value.
The company may soon face a disruption in its executive suite, as well.
Its senior leaders -- the chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, and the chief financial officer, J. Timothy Howard, are under substantial political and regulatory pressure to resign in the wake of the commission's announcement.

But even that kind of change could be positive, Mr. Rohman said.
New executives might be able to repair Fannie Mae's frayed relationship with the federal government, which is crucial to the company's success, he said.
"If you look at the people running Fannie Mae, the presentation for the last two years is that there is nothing wrong and they've done nothing wrong," Mr. Rohman said.
"The thing that the market is probably reflecting on is you're now looking with greater certainty toward a new management team, and that is good -- that's what we need here."

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, its slightly smaller corporate cousin, are government-sponsored companies that play a crucial role in the home mortgage market.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The two companies issue bonds to investors and use the money raised to buy mortgages from banks, profiting from the difference in rates between the debt they sell and the mortgages they buy.
For example, Fannie Mae might issue bonds yielding 5 percent interest and use the proceeds to buy mortgages with a 6 percent rate.
But the value of mortgages is very sensitive to changes in rates, leaving the companies at risk of large losses if the rates move quickly.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac try to reduce that danger with complex hedging strategies that include derivatives, financial contracts that rise or fall in value based on the value of some underlying measure.
The companies buy derivatives whose value will rise if interest rates move in a way that causes them to lose money on their portfolio of mortgages.
In the past, Freddie Mac has hedged more of its risk than Fannie Mae.
But accounting for the value of derivatives is complex, especially when the derivatives are being used as hedges against other securities.

Understanding Fannie Mae's true profitability is even more complex, accounting experts say.
They point to a measure called the fair-value balance sheet, which includes the value of every part of Fannie Mae's portfolio, including the mortgages it owns, the debt it has issued and its derivatives.
Many accounting experts say that changes in Fannie Mae's fair-value balance sheet are the most important measure of the company's profit or loss for a given period.
Those earnings will be affected by the $9 billion charge.
But the fair-value balance sheet will not, and that is what matters most, Mr. Posner said.
"The fair-value measure -- that's the best measure," he said.
"If the fair-value number was not calculated properly, I'd be very concerned."
Alan Greenspan did what he had to do last Tuesday, raising interest rates for the fifth time in a row by a quarter point, to 2.25 percent, and leaving little doubt that the increases would continue.
But whether the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee will be able to stick to its self-described "measured" pace is an open question.
Much depends on decisions that have more to do with fiscal and trade policy, the domain of President Bush and his merry band of weak-dollar-big-deficit policy makers, than with monetary policy, the domain of the Fed.
That's because the administration's policies exert upward pressure on prices and interest rates, risking what a recent Fed staff report on trade imbalances calls "wrenching changes."
The Fed has to raise rates because continued low rates would only contribute to a glut of dollars, further inflating real estate values and, eventually, other prices as well.
At the same time, however, the Fed must contend with the inflationary pressures inherent in the administration's weak-dollar policy.
The administration believes that it can rely on a weak dollar to fix America's huge trade imbalance, thereby avoiding the more fundamental fix of reducing the huge federal budget deficit.
But a weak dollar runs the risk of inflating the prices of all goods, not just foreign ones, because as imports become more expensive, domestic producers raise prices in tandem.
Moreover, the outsized deficits require huge infusions of capital from abroad, and that need could also lead to higher interest rates as the Treasury attempts to lure lenders to our heavily indebted shores.
Against this backdrop, measured interest-rate increases may someday seem a luxury -- and that someday could be soon.
In a report issued on the day after the Fed's latest rate increase, the Treasury Department reported that money flowing into the United States -- capital that is crucial to finance our deficits -- plummeted in October to $48.1 billion, a 12-month low.
It was the seventh decline this year out of the 10 months for which data has been collected, and that is a bad omen for America's continued ability to finance its deficits on the terms currently being offered.
Meanwhile, higher interest rates hurt job creation and wages.
A majority of working Americans have never participated fully in this economic recovery, now more than three years old.
The need to raise rates before employment and wages have rebounded is another indication of an economy off-kilter.
The Fed's attempt to be "measured" is imperiled by the administration's willingness to risk "wrenching changes."
The wrenching change the country really needs is to move away from profligacy and toward a semblance of balance in fiscal and trade matters.
Mr. Greenspan and his Fed colleagues are expected to raise interest rates further next year, a step that could help the dollar by making it more attractive to invest in bonds in the United States.

Central bankers and finance ministers abroad are important as well.
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, influences decisions on both interest rates and currency interventions.
And Hiroshi Watanabe, vice minister for international affairs at the Finance Ministry of Japan, guides his country's foreign exchange policy.
But in the end, the most important figure may well be Hu Jintao, the Chinese president and Communist Party chief.
The focus should be on Mr. Hu because China has pegged its currency, the yuan, to the dollar.
When this peg is either relaxed or tossed out, the dollar is likely to plunge sharply against it.

Some economists argue that if the Chinese do not allow the yuan to trade more freely, the dollar will not fall enough to reduce the nation's record current-account deficit.

That deficit, the broad gap between the nation's exports and imports of goods and services, is expected to top $600 billion this year.
A weaker dollar could reduce it by making foreign imports more expensive for Americans while American exports are priced more competitively abroad.

Mr. Palmera and Mr. Tovar are not the most typical of combatants in the longest-running war in the Americas, a conflict whose fighters usually come from the ranks of the dispossessed.
But no two adversaries are better known, especially in this tradition-bound city of 350,000.
The loss of favorite sons to two armed groups still confounds, leaving people here shaking their heads and tearful that war sidetracked two men whose lives held so much promise.
Their story is so compelling an example of how war has touched ordinary people that Diomedes Díaz, Colombia's best-known Vallenato crooner, incorporated Mr. Palmera into one of his songs.
"Of course, people must be surprised," Mr. Tovar, 45, dressed in combat fatigues, said in a recent interview.
People have to be surprised by anyone from Valledupar who picks up a gun, because we were never those kinds of people."

Mr. Hill, the federal agency official, acknowledged that pro-government party officials who do show up at American-financed political seminars often come "as much for intelligence-gathering purposes, to see what the West is doing."

Contractors say few if any government officials or pro-government party officials show up for such training sessions.
In fact, the contractors acknowledged, nearly all of the seminars and programs are intended to train people outside the government to be more effective at dealing with a balky, sometimes autocratic government.

"Are we overtly partisan?"
"I would say no."
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, responding to Mr. Lavrov's accusations against Freedom House and other contractors earlier this month, said the administration was "pleased" to pay for their work, "for the purpose of making sure that all sides have an opportunity to express their view."
Right now, the only progress seems to lie in the willingness of the re-elected President Bush to face some hard truths:

One certainly involves Iraqi security forces, which have always been presented as the key to American withdrawal.
For more than a year, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other Pentagon officials had been reporting that many tens of thousands of Iraqis were being trained to take over frontline security duties, allowing American forces first to pull back from major cities and then, at a later phase, come home.
Mr. Bush was admirably blunt about it at his news conference on Monday, noting that while a few good generals and some good foot soldiers had been trained, "the whole command structure necessary to have a viable military is not in place."

We are glad to hear Mr. Bush acknowledge this sobering reality, but we are still waiting for him to explain who will have to fill in for these noncombat-ready Iraqis and for how long.
Given the lack of other countries willing to put up their hands as volunteers, the only answer seems to be more American troops, and not just through the spring, as currently planned.
Since the first days of the occupation, American troops have been too light on the ground in Iraq, allowing the looting and sabotage that soon turned into insurgency to get a costly head start.

And facing the need for an expanded American military presence means more than a simple reshuffling of deployments.
If more troops in Iraq are not going to translate into a dangerously exhausted and overstretched Army, Marine Corps and National Guard, these forces need to be expanded through stepped-up recruitment.
That means bigger spending on the least politically attractive part of the military budget, basic personnel salaries, and less for costly new weapons systems.
Another harsh reality that needs to be confronted head-on is the prospect for the Iraqi elections.
But things now appear headed toward a badly skewed result.
Enthusiasm and participation seem high among Shiites and Kurds, who suffered greatly under Sunni minority rule and now thirst for self-government.
But in predominantly Sunni areas, including Mosul, parts of Baghdad and most of central and western Iraq, there is a deep and growing alienation that threatens to depress electoral turnout and provides a large reservoir of support for the insurgency.
Without an acceptable level of participation across Iraq, the elections will not be able to produce a legitimate government capable of standing on its own, mastering the insurgency and surviving without the indefinite presence of large numbers of American troops.
The causes of Sunni alienation from the current political process actually run far deeper, and affect large numbers of people who cannot be classified as Al Qaeda supporters, Islamic fundamentalists or sworn followers of Saddam Hussein.
A broader feeling has begun to take root that Sunnis have no political, professional or personal future in the new Iraq being shaped by Washington and its Shiite and Kurdish allies.
It has fed off the continuing failure to assure that authentic Sunni nationalist politicians had an adequate voice in the interim government and election preparations.
A further level of resentment has been added by the physical destruction of homes, jobs and infrastructure produced by American counterinsurgency campaigns in densely populated Sunni towns like Falluja.
A coalition of Sunni political leaders led by Adnan Pachachi, a respected moderate, has repeatedly called for postponing the January election for several months to encourage broader Sunni participation.
His pleas need to be taken seriously, not brushed aside as they have been till now by Baghdad and Washington.

Leaving Iraq's Sunnis in such a sullen, resentful mood would undermine the creation of a new and stable Iraq and poison its relations with the rest of the Arab world, where Sunnis strongly predominate.
Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, somehow seems unable to recognize this.
Instead of reinforcing him in his folly, the Bush administration should be actively encouraging him to think afresh.
If postponing the election date can ensure more adequate Sunni participation, it is in everyone's interest to do so.
The Bush privatization plan coming into view would work as follows.
Workers now pay to Social Security 6.25 percent of their wages up to $87,900, matched equally by their employer.
Workers would be allowed to divert four percentage points, up to a maximum of $1,000 a year, to private investments in stocks and bonds.
The investment accounts would be limited to highly diversified mutual funds, or even index funds, and the transactions costs would be kept to a minimal 0.3 percent.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

So far so good.
But to make sure there is enough incoming payroll tax to support promised benefits, Social Security benefits guaranteed under the present system would be cut slightly for each dollar the individual worker diverts to his or her private accounts.
More important, future benefits would also be cut by indexing them to the rise in consumer prices rather than, as is now done, to rising wages, which tend, over time, to outpace inflation by a significant margin.
Indexing to prices may look sensible to Americans, but the reduction in future benefits from the present plan is likely to be severe.
By 2075, under the most commonly accepted economic assumptions, indexing benefits to prices rather than wages would mean that benefits would be nearly 50 percent lower than under the current system.
Many privatization plans call for such an adjustment.
Will the magic of private investment accounts make up for the reductions?
The answer is no.
We can compute how retirees fare if they earned the historical average of 4.6 percent a year (after transaction costs) on a portfolio of stocks and bonds.
William Dudley, chief economist of Goldman Sachs, has calculated that benefits for a typical retired one-earner family would come to about 93 percent of the projected benefits from the present Social Security system in 2022.
In 2075, the benefits would fall to only 77 percent of present-system benefits.

So Americans who think privatization will necessarily preserve their retirement incomes should think again.
Most privatization plans involve a decided cut in average benefits.

Still, advocates of privatization correctly point out, these cuts may be less over time than the cuts required to make the present system solvent.
Based on the Social Security Administration projections, monthly benefits may have to be reduced to around 67 percent to 75 percent of projected levels.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But by no means is everyone going to earn the 4.6 percent average.
The history of private investment unmistakably shows that there is a wide dispersion of results.
Some will invest only in bonds, others may choose the wrong mutual fund, or switch from one to another at exactly the wrong times.
And some will have the bad luck of retiring in the midst of a bear market.
Many workers will therefore inevitably earn less, and some considerably less.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

To determine how sensitive retirement income is to the rate of investment return, Mr. Dudley worked out some calculations under Reform Model 2.
The results are stunning.
If a worker earns just the respectable expected bond rate of 3 percent a year, or 2.7 percent after transactions costs, then the typical one-earner family will retire on only about 58 percent of the projected benefits under current law.
If the investor earns zero over time, which may well occur for some investors, the projected retirement benefit is only a little more than 38 percent of the current benefit.
These are considerably worse than the projected adjustments needed to bring the present system into balance.
And there are other costs to privatization.
Consider the potential impact from borrowing as much as $2 trillion, which many experts see as the projected transition costs to cover the gap that would arise in payments to current retirees and those retiring soon once workers started diverting into private accounts some of the payroll taxes used to pay benefits.
Financial markets may not absorb that debt without interest rates rising and the dollar falling.

As the privatization arguments are clarified, the ultimate decision Americans will have to make is over the purpose of the public pension system.
For all the alarm over Social Security, the present guaranteed system can be fixed with only moderate tax increases and through less harsh benefit reductions, particularly if Americans are prepared to raise the official retirement age slightly to reflect generally longer life spans.
The privatization plan the Bush administration is leaning toward, in contrast, will divide people into winners and losers.
It may make some workers better off in retirement, and may well reduce costs somewhat to government, if all goes well.
But a significant number of American retirees will do poorly.

The housing market would not have to collapse to have a negative impact on the economy.
Even a lack of appreciation could put a damper on consumer spending by depressing sentiment and the volume of refinancings.
House prices vary significantly by market, of course, and it is reasonable to think that a decline in prices would be most likely in areas that have had the strongest gains.
And those areas are concentrated in states that voted Democratic in the last election.
Rhode Island and California led the list of states, although neither could match the 80 percent rise in the District of Columbia.
In California, the median-price home costs $460,000, and the state association of Realtors says only 19 percent of the state's residents earn enough to afford to buy such a home.
With the trade deficit hitting records, the American government seems to welcome a weak dollar.
But there are surely limits to that.
A nightmare for the Fed would be that it finds itself under pressure to raise rates to support the dollar, just at the time that a weakening housing market needs lower rates to avoid big declines.
If that were to happen, the Fed might regret having done so much to encourage the boom in home prices.

Perhaps Asia's most unlikely democratic leader, Mr. Elbegdorj is a pudgy, bespectacled intellectual whose 41 years track the extraordinary political transformation of this vast, thinly populated nation sandwiched between Russia and China.
Like most members of his 17-member cabinet, Mr. Elbegdorj studied in the Soviet Union but now advocates free market economics.
Now, his Liberty Center foundation, which promotes political and legal reform, is overseeing translations into Mongolian of the works of Milton Friedman and Friedrich A. Hayek.

THE Communist era already seems like ancient history for Mongolia's overwhelmingly young population, which has proved remarkably receptive to democracy and has embraced free speech and free markets.
"We want to show the world that so-called Western values not only belong to America, Europe, South Korea and Japan, but to Mongolia," Mr. Elbegdorj said, proud that Mongolia survives as a multiparty democracy in an authoritarian sea, with China to the south, Russia to the north, North Korea to the east and the autarchies of Central Asia to the west.
Exactly why is a matter of debate.
Historically, Mongolians have been receptive to new ideas and gifted at foreign languages, a heritage of living for centuries on the Silk Road from Asia to Europe.
After 300 years of domination, first by China and then by the Soviet Union, moreover, they have an acute sense of the value of freedom.

Mr. Elbegdorj also points to the role of the United States, which has contributed money and advice in the quest to build strong democratic institutions.

This is actually Mr. Elbegdorj's second turn in the top job.
Now a humbler, more wary Mr. Elbegdorj is back in power, hoping to push Mongolia toward a free market, high-technology economy.
In addition to replacing dead Communists with Genghis Khan in the nation's mythology, he wants English to supplant Russian as Mongolia's primary foreign language, state ministers to hand out their e-mail addresses and an independent public broadcasting board to control Mongolia's state-owned radio and television.
He has grand plans to spin a web of fiber-optic high-speed Internet cables across this land that is twice the size of Texas, and to place a cellphone in the pocket of every herder.

"If I have e-mail access, and you have e-mail access, that makes us more equal," said the prime minister, who often answers questions on his new bilingual Mongolian-English Web site: www.open-government.mn.
Warier of his opponents this time around, he devotes weekends to politicking and building support: Saturdays for trips to the interior and Sundays for socializing with cabinet members, half of whom are allied with the former Communists.
"In the classroom, everything is plain, you don't feel the heat," he said.

TO the south, he has a problem in China, an economic colossus with about 500 times the population of Mongolia's 2.5 million inhabitants.
Militarily and diplomatically, China is flexing new muscles as well.
"I hope China will become a responsible superpower," he said, choosing his words very carefully.
"We wish all the best for China."

Then there is North Korea, a constant destabilizing force even though it is 500 miles away.
The problem is that defectors make their way through China to the Mongolian border, where Mongolia is committed to providing them a haven until transport can be arranged to a country that will accept them, usually South Korea.
Anything that encourages defections, however, is sure to irritate China.
For protection in the neighborhood, Mongolia is counting on close ties with the United States.
It regularly unrolls the red carpet for visiting American officials, most recently Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, the commander of United States forces in the Pacific.

Asked if Mongolia would continue to send soldiers to Iraq, the prime minister's face clouded.
"If America asks us to send a fourth contingent," he started.
The consequences of that decision can be seen in government statistics and in stores, where consumers once again were spending robustly before Christmas.
More than two million jobs have been created since the depths of the crisis early in 2002, and according to official figures, inflation-adjusted income has also bounced back, returning almost to the level of the late 1990's.
That is when the crisis emerged, as Argentina sought to tighten its belt according to I.M.F.

Some of the new jobs are from a low-paying government make-work program, but nearly half are in the private sector.
As a result, unemployment has declined from more than 20 percent to about 13 percent, and the number of Argentines living below the poverty line has fallen by nearly 10 points from the record high of 53.4 percent early in 2002.
"Things are by no means back to normal, but we've got the feeling we're back on the right track," said Mario Alberto Ortiz, a refrigeration repairman.
"For the first time since things fell apart, I can actually afford to spend a little money."
Traditional free-market economists remain skeptical of the government's approach.
While acknowledging there has been a recovery, they attribute it mainly to external factors rather than the policies of President Néstor Kirchner, who has been in office since May 2003.
Increasingly, they also maintain that the comeback is beginning to lose steam.

"We've been lucky," said Juan Luis Bour, chief economist at the Latin American Foundation for Economic Research here.
"We've had high prices for commodities and low interest rates.
But if we want to grow in 2005, we're going to have to settle the debt question and have foreign capital come in."

The I.M.F., which Argentine officials blame for inducing the crisis in the first place, argues that the current government is acting at least in part as the I.M.F.
has always recommended.
It has limited spending and moved to increase revenues, a classic prescription when an economy is ailing, and has built up a surplus twice the size of what the fund had asked before negotiations were put on hold several months ago.

"The return to these encouraging numbers has been helped a lot by a fiscal discipline that is almost unprecedented by Argentine standards," said John Dodsworth, the senior I.M.F.
representative here.
"We've had a primary surplus which has increased steadily over these past few years at both the central and provincial levels, and that has been the main anchor on the economic side."
But some of that record budget surplus has come from a pair of levies on exports and financial transactions that orthodox economists at the I.M.F.
and elsewhere want to see repealed.
About a third of government revenues are now raised by those taxes, which have surged.

"The I.M.F.
wants these taxes to be eliminated, but on the other hand they also want Argentina to improve its offer to creditors and also pay back the fund so it can reduce its own exposure here," said Alan Cibils, an Argentine economist associated with the independent Interdisciplinary Center for the Study of Public Policy here.
"In other words, they are saying, 'You have to pay out more and take in less,' which is a sure prescription for another crisis."
Because of the absence of a debt accord and a stalemate over utility tariffs, some investors, mainly European, continue to shun Argentina, citing what they call the lack of "judicial security."
But others, mainly Latin Americans used to operating in unstable environments or themselves survivors of similar crises, have increased their presence here amid expanding opportunities.

"These are slogans that people repeat without thinking, as if they were parrots," Roberto Lavagna, the minister of the economy, said when asked about the predictions that investment would disappear.
"So why are they investing?
Because today clearly they can get a very good rate of return."

The Brazilian oil company Petrobras bought a stake in a leading energy company.

But the bulk of the new investment comes from Argentines who are beginning to spend their money at home, either bringing their savings back from abroad or from under their mattresses.
For the first time in three years, more money is coming into the country than is leaving it.
That has given Mr. Kirchner the luxury of taking a hard line with the monetary fund and with foreign creditors clamoring for repayment.

"The thing is that Argentina has a current account surplus, so they don't really need so much foreign investment," said Claudio Loser, an Argentine economist and the former Western Hemisphere director for the I.M.F.
"Domestic investment is taking place because there are opportunities in agriculture, oil and gas."
Just this week, the government announced that reserves of foreign currency have climbed back to $19.5 billion, their highest level since the crash and more than double the low recorded in the middle of 2002, a year with a net outflow of $12.7 billion.
"The peak of investment in the 1990's was 19.9 percent" of gross domestic product annually "and today it is at 19.1 percent, having risen from a low of 10 percent," Mr. Lavagna said.
The Kirchner administration continues to seek an accord on the $167 billion in debt that is still outstanding, and plans to make what it calls its final offer early next month.
But the turnabout here has inspired such a sense of confidence that the government is not only talking about cutting its last ties to the I.M.F.
but also insisting that any payback to bondholders be linked to Argentina's continued good economic health.

"It's very simple," Mr. Lavagna said.

In all, some sat for as long as 50 minutes before finally getting what they had paid good money to see.
At a recent screening of "I 3/5sheart 4/5 Huckabees" in the same theater, the commercials drove one man to shout a strong, all-too-familiar obscenity at the screen.
It may be too early to predict a full-throated consumer uprising.
But the stirrings of rebellion are evident despite the happy talk from some theater owners.
One major chain, Regal Entertainment Group, has cited an Arbitron survey contending that most audiences, especially younger ones, like advertisements.
Jason Thompson is skeptical.

IT would have been nice to ask Loews Cineplex Entertaiment what it thinks.

Granted, in a world of wars and killer tsunamis, this issue ranks far down the list of things to keep you tossing and turning at night.
But movies, particularly during Christmas week, are as much a part of America as supersized fast food.
The advent of the commercials leaves some people feeling they are being played for suckers.
"I don't just hate them -- I resent them," Steve Rappaport said on Sunday at Loews Lincoln Square.
"I think the reaction is starting to become more noticeable.
I think it's because the commercials are getting longer."
Another moviegoer, Elizabeth Cooke Levy, objected not only to the advertisements but also to their running when the film is supposed to start.
"I'd like them to show the movie at the time they say they will," she said.
Plainly, the commercials have not stopped ticket prices from steadily rising.
The National Association of Theater Owners -- there's an acronym for you: NATO -- says the average movie ticket in the United States cost $6.03 last year.

Now and then, headline-seeking politicians propose boycotts of theaters to protest high prices.
But that suggestion doesn't fly any more than do occasional calls to stay clear of the concession stands, where theaters really make their money.
One idea from Mr. Thompson's group is to shout at the screen during commercials.
That tactic has clearly begun to enjoy some support in New York.

NYC
The chef and owner, Masayoshi Takayama, who operated Ginza Sushiko in Beverly Hills before relocating to Manhattan, does not present you with a menu or choices.
You are fed what he elects to feed you, most of it sushi, in the sequence and according to the rhythm he decrees.
You do not seize control at Masa.
You surrender it.
You pay to be putty.
And you pay dearly.
The price fluctuates with the season and the availability of certain delicacies.
It now stands at $350 a person before tax, tip and sip of sake or bottled water.
Masa, which reopens Jan. 11 after a holiday break, is arguably the most expensive restaurant in New York.
Lunch or dinner for two can easily exceed $1,000.

Justifiable?
I leave that question to accountants and ethicists.
Worth it?
The answer depends on your budget and priorities.
But in my experience, the silky, melting quality of Masa's toro and uni and sea bream, coupled with the serenity of its ambience, does not exist in New York at a lower price.
Masa is not merely sushi.
The first third of a nearly three-hour meal here entails other indulgences, presented at methodically paced intervals and in prudently restrained portions.
There may be an uni risotto with white truffle; dollops of a perilous blowfish's prized liver; slices of foie gras, to be cooked slightly in a ceramic hot pot; a mound of toro tartare and caviar to be spread on toasted rectangles of Japanese sweet bread.
But the last two-thirds of a meal are devoted to sushi, and Masa is devoted to doing this one very worthy thing to perfection.
You get the best sense of this pursuit if you sit in one of the 10 seats at the hinoki wood bar, sanded so frequently that you catch its faint scent the second you leave the glare and hubbub of the Time Warner Center and enter this diffusely lighted, windowless sanctuary.

Behind the bar stands Mr. Takayama, in a simple white or gray shirt that looks like the top of a monk's robe.
He is often flanked by two other chefs, both in simple black shirts, both with extremely short hair or heads shaved like his, as if any grooming more fanciful would compete with their calling to be vessels for immaculate yellowtail.

A chef makes your sushi a piece or two at a time, reaching for a pristine slab of fluke or Spanish mackerel and using a bone-handled knife to carve a sliver.
He presses wasabi or maybe shiso flakes onto a bed of warm rice, lays the fish atop it and then anoints this jewel with soy sauce, yuzu or sudachi, a limelike Japanese fruit.

From just inches away, you watch this ritual, which culminates in the chef's placing the sushi in front of you with a bare hand.
You in turn use a bare hand to lift it to your lips.
Now the chef watches you, palpably anticipating your delight.
This whole exchange has an immediacy and intimacy unlike anything at more conventional restaurants or for that matter at other upscale sushi bars, which tend not to have Masa's low ratio of sushi priests to sushi supplicants, sometimes one to two, especially at lunch.
Masa deals not in wide-angle splendor and broad-canvas fireworks but in tight close-ups and miniaturist flares.
It prizes simplicity not only in its cuisine but also in its uncluttered environment, which keeps the focus on the food.
Other restaurants strive to be extravagant theaters.
Masa, with 26 seats in all, intends to be a minimalist temple, all neutral colors and reverential hush.
The servers, who bring you finger bowls of lemon water and tell you to turn off your cellphone, seem to have been hired for their genetic inability to speak above a whisper.
The only implements they give you are the ones you need at a given instant, and these are usually made not of silver and crystal but of lacquered wood and bamboo.

Masa is the first Japanese restaurant to receive four stars from The New York Times since Mimi Sheraton gave that rating to Hatsuhana in 1983, and it speaks a culinary idiom distinct from that of New York's other current four-star establishments, all French-inspired.

But it is very much a restaurant of this time and place.
Of a dining culture in which linens and petit fours are no longer nonnegotiable badges of class.
In which a blockbuster main course often cedes its eminence to a subtler succession of small plates.
In which a chef's seriousness is judged not only by his skill but also by the distances he will reach -- and the courier bills he will amass -- in the service and worship of superior ingredients.

Mr. Takayama trawls the globe, reeling in bay scallops from as nearby as New England and grouper from as far as Japan.

Masa certainly has drawbacks, including its reverie-rupturing location in a mall.
If you do not reserve a spot at the bar and wind up sitting at one of the tables away from it, some of the immediacy of the ritual is diminished, and the restaurant's pleasures are dimmed.
But they are by no means extinguished.

Currently, those banks include two government-owned behemoths, with about 160 branches each nationwide, and 19 private-sector banks -- some with shares listed on the Baghdad stock exchange -- ranging in size from a single branch to 19.
All but one of the banks run according to Western, rather than the more restrictive Islamic, banking principles.

Many analysts said the industry is in a sorry condition, a legacy of Saddam Hussein's stranglehold on business and a dozen years of United Nations sanctions that prevented many technological advances from reaching the country.
At the government-owned banks, the branches are cold, musty chambers where customers stand in line for hours as employees sit idly at their desks.
While the private banks tend to look better, there are no cash machines or online payments in Iraq.
Banks handle transactions by hand rather than using electronic Swift codes, for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the international standard for moving money.
Though most banks use computers, many branches have antiquated equipment with DOS-based operating systems.
In any case, electricity shortages often render the machines useless.

Moreover, Mr. Hussein's policies of encouraging reliance on the state continue to shadow Iraq's financial industry.
According to a study by Kais al-Badri, an adviser to the Dar Es Salaam Investment Bank, a commercial bank in Baghdad, only 16 percent of the roughly $2 billion on deposit nationwide is in private-sector banks.
Much of the rest remains in the hands of the two state banks: Rafadain, established in 1941, and Rashid, which was spun off from Rafadain in 1988.

Still, the fall of the Hussein regime has encouraged the private sector.
At least two new banks have opened since April 2003, and eight others have submitted applications to open.
Foreigners have begun venturing in, taking advantage of investment laws that grant non-Iraqis a level of access to the country unprecedented in much of the Middle East.
And Iraqi banks, mostly barred by Mr. Hussein from ties to the outside world, have been welcoming foreigners and venturing abroad as well.

Indeed, Iraq's tight credit market has gotten worse.
According to a study by Citigroup, which has no banking operations in Iraq, nearly 30 percent of the country's banking assets remain uninvested, up from 12 percent in 2001.
But some analysts said that Iraqi banks, at least the private-sector ones, will soon be more agile, modern and profitable.
Mr. Kubba said Commercial Bank had already begun taking steps toward introducing Swift codes, bank machines and even credit cards.
And most of the banks have invested in computer training, either in Iraq or abroad.

Under new rules, interest rate ceilings have been removed and banks have a freer hand in issuing consumer credit.
"Many more changes in the money market, capital market and the banking business are envisaged, and it is now only a matter of time -- short rather than long," Mowafaq H.

Perhaps more important, said Kevin Woelflein, a former United States occupation adviser working with commercial bankers here, is that Iraq's bankers have become bolder, more willing to challenge authority as well as to reach out to the rest of the world, and to do so despite the hardships.

The new laws also aim to make Iraqi banks healthier by increasing their capital to 50 billion dinars by 2006 -- a threshold no Iraqi bank now meets.

"Don't let stress get the best of you," the caption says.
Maya Native Americans of the Yucatan Peninsula and adjacent parts of Central America developed the New World's most advanced civilization before Columbus.
From local origins around 2,500 years ago, Maya societies rose especially after the year A.D. 250, reaching peaks of population and sophistication in the late 8th century.
The last known date recorded on a Maya monument by their so-called Long Count calendar corresponds to the year 909.
Those problems were exacerbated by droughts, which may have been partly caused by humans themselves through deforestation.
Why weren't these problems obvious to the Maya kings, who could surely see their forests vanishing and their hills becoming eroded?
By extracting wealth from commoners, they could remain well fed while everyone else was slowly starving.

What's more, the kings were preoccupied with their own power struggles.
They had to concentrate on fighting one another and keeping up their images through ostentatious displays of wealth.
By insulating themselves in the short run from the problems of society, the elite merely bought themselves the privilege of being among the last to starve.
Why?

In many respects, Pitcairn and Henderson are tropical paradises, rich in some food sources and essential raw materials.
Pitcairn is home to Southeast Polynesia's largest quarry of stone suited for making adzes, while Henderson has the region's largest breeding seabird colony and its only nesting beach for sea turtles.
Yet the islanders depended on imports from Mangareva Island, hundreds of miles away, for canoes, crops, livestock and oyster shells for making tools.
Unfortunately for the inhabitants of Pitcairn and Henderson, their Mangarevan trading partner collapsed for reasons similar to those underlying the Maya decline: deforestation, erosion and warfare.
The Maya and the Henderson and Pitcairn Islanders are not alone, of course.
Famous victims include the Anasazi in the American Southwest, who abandoned their cities in the 12th century because of environmental problems and climate change, and the Greenland Norse, who disappeared in the 15th century because of all five interacting factors on the checklist.
There were also the ancient Fertile Crescent societies, the Khmer at Angkor Wat, the Moche society of Peru -- the list goes on.

But before we let ourselves get depressed, we should also remember that there is another long list of cultures that have managed to prosper for lengthy periods of time.
Societies in Japan, Tonga, Tikopia, the New Guinea Highlands and Central and Northwest Europe, for example, have all found ways to sustain themselves.
What separates the lost cultures from those that survived?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Half of the answer involves environmental differences: geography deals worse cards to some societies than to others.
But it's not the case that a congenial environment guarantees success: some societies (like the Maya) managed to ruin lush environments, while other societies -- like the Incas, the Inuit, Icelanders and desert Australian Aborigines -- have managed to carry on in some of the earth's most daunting environments.
The other half of the answer involves differences in a society's responses to problems.
Ninth-century New Guinea Highland villagers, 16th-century German landowners, and the Tokugawa shoguns of 17th-century Japan all recognized the deforestation spreading around them and solved the problem, either by developing scientific reforestation (Japan and Germany) or by transplanting tree seedlings (New Guinea).

They reduced wood consumption by turning to light-timbered construction, to fuel-efficient stoves and heaters, and to coal as a source of energy.
At the same time, they increased wood production by developing and carefully managing plantation forests.
In addition, Japan's isolation at the time made it obvious that the country would have to depend on its own resources and couldn't meet its needs by pillaging other countries.
Today, despite having the highest human population density of any large developed country, Japan is more than 70 percent forested.
There is a similar story from Iceland.
Significant erosion ensued, carrying half of Iceland's topsoil into the ocean within a century or two.

What lessons can we draw from history?
The most straightforward: take environmental problems seriously.
They destroyed societies in the past, and they are even more likely to do so now.
If 6,000 Polynesians with stone tools were able to destroy Mangareva Island, consider what six billion people with metal tools and bulldozers are doing today.
Moreover, while the Maya collapse affected just a few neighboring societies in Central America, globalization now means that any society's problems have the potential to affect anyone else.
Just think how crises in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq have shaped the United States today.
Other lessons involve failures of group decision-making.
There are many reasons why past societies made bad decisions, and thereby failed to solve or even to perceive the problems that would eventually destroy them.
One reason involves conflicts of interest, whereby one group within a society (for instance, the pig farmers who caused the worst erosion in medieval Greenland and Iceland) can profit by engaging in practices that damage the rest of society.
Another is the pursuit of short-term gains at the expense of long-term survival, as when fishermen overfish the stocks on which their livelihoods ultimately depend.

History also teaches us two deeper lessons about what separates successful societies from those heading toward failure.
A society contains a built-in blueprint for failure if the elite insulates itself from the consequences of its actions.

Could this happen in the United States?
It's a thought that often occurs to me here in Los Angeles, when I drive by gated communities, guarded by private security patrols, and filled with people who drink bottled water, depend on private pensions, and send their children to private schools.
By doing these things, they lose the motivation to support the police force, the municipal water supply, Social Security and public schools.
If conditions deteriorate too much for poorer people, gates will not keep the rioters out.
Rioters eventually burned the palaces of Maya kings and tore down the statues of Easter Island chiefs; they have also already threatened wealthy districts in Los Angeles twice in recent decades.
In contrast, the elite in 17th-century Japan, as in modern Scandinavia and the Netherlands, could not ignore or insulate themselves from broad societal problems.
For instance, the Dutch upper class for hundreds of years has been unable to insulate itself from the Netherlands' water management problems for a simple reason: the rich live in the same drained lands below sea level as the poor.
If the dikes and pumps keeping out the sea fail, the well-off Dutch know that they will drown along with everybody else, which is precisely what happened during the floods of 1953.

The other deep lesson involves a willingness to re-examine long-held core values, when conditions change and those values no longer make sense.
They died off as a result, leaving Greenland to the Inuit.
On the other hand, the British in the 1950's faced up to the need for a painful reappraisal of their former status as rulers of a world empire set apart from Europe.

In this New Year, we Americans have our own painful reappraisals to face.
We can't continue to deplete our own resources as well as those of much of the rest of the world.
Now, technology and global interconnectedness have robbed us of our protection.
In recent years, we have responded to foreign threats largely by seeking short-term military solutions at the last minute.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But how long can we keep this up?
Though we are the richest nation on earth, there's simply no way we can afford (or muster the troops) to intervene in the dozens of countries where emerging threats lurk -- particularly when each intervention these days can cost more than $100 billion and require more than 100,000 troops.
A genuine reappraisal would require us to recognize that it will be far less expensive and far more effective to address the underlying problems of public health, population and environment that ultimately cause threats to us to emerge in poor countries.
In the past, we have regarded foreign aid as either charity or as buying support; now, it's an act of self-interest to preserve our own economy and protect American lives.
Do we have cause for hope?
Many of my friends are pessimistic when they contemplate the world's growing population and human demands colliding with shrinking resources.
But I draw hope from the knowledge that humanity's biggest problems today are ones entirely of our own making.
Asteroids hurtling at us beyond our control don't figure high on our list of imminent dangers.
To save ourselves, we don't need new technology: we just need the political will to face up to our problems of population and the environment.
I also draw hope from a unique advantage that we enjoy.
Unlike any previous society in history, our global society today is the first with the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of societies remote from us in space and in time.
We, on the other hand, have a detailed chronicle of human successes and failures at our disposal.
Will we choose to use it?

In 1882, having perfected his incandescent bulbs, Edison turned his attention to building a DC electrical system that could illuminate them.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

At 3 p.m. on Sept. 4, 1882, an employee of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company flipped the main circuit breaker on Pearl Street.
The future success of Edison's DC system must have seemed assured to the inventor and his investors as they celebrated its debut that evening.
Edison had located the plant near his first customers because DC can travel only short distances, as little as half a mile, before losing strength.
To serve New York, and realize his plan, Edison would have needed to build a power plant in every square mile of the city.

There was, unfortunately for Edison, a better, cheaper way to deliver electricity to New York.
And some of Edison's competitors, notably George Westinghouse, were already grasping it.
The alternative was alternating current.

The difference between DC and AC lies mainly in how the voltage travels.
DC is conducted in a constant one-way flow, like the current of a river.
AC is more tidal in motion, oscillating -- flip-flopping, if you will -- between poles of attraction.
The crucial distinction is that AC transmits far better than DC, over longer distance and at higher voltages.
This means that power generated hundreds of miles away, by a waterfall, for instance, can be efficiently and economically distributed to customers in New York and elsewhere.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It is perhaps not surprising that Edison, who had invested so much effort and money into his patented DC system, failed to appreciate the superior qualities of AC.
As Jill Jonnes writes in "Empires of Light," a history of early electricity, the AC/DC dispute soon degenerated into "one of the most unusual and caustic battles in American corporate history."

Some of Edison's supporters sought to demonstrate the evils of the "damnable current" by publicly electrocuting cats and dogs and, most infamously, an irascible Coney Island elephant named Topsy, whose reign as Luna Park's star attraction ended abruptly when employees of Edison fed 6,600 volts of alternating current into her three-ton bulk.
Indeed, given all of AC's advantages, it is remarkable that DC continued to endure in New York's power grid all these years.

Today, about 1,600 customers still receive DC power in New York.
All are in Manhattan, scattered among Upper West Side apartment houses, Garment District loft buildings, hotels and brownstones.
Typically, these users rely on DC for limited purposes, like feeding the motors of century-old elevators or fire pumps, relics from an earlier age of electricity.
The holdouts have withstood a five-year campaign by Con Edison to wean them from DC, including cajoling letters and escalating surcharges.
Con Ed's patience is wearing thin.

"I have a drop-dead date," said Stephen F. Wood, the utility's vice president of energy services and point man on DC elimination.
"The president of the company has basically said: 'You've committed to getting this out of the system by the end of 2005.
Now make it happen."'
Since then, Con Ed has been converting AC to DC by way of hundreds of underground rectifiers.
Maintaining two separate power systems, one quite old, is cumbersome, and, Mr. Wood added, "DC gives us a higher percentage of problems per section of cable than we get from the AC system."

Whatever the solution, it's unclear how many of the 1,600 will comply with Con Ed's deadline.
"We know we'll have some customers, a limited number, who are going to be very difficult," Mr. Wood allowed.
"Probably a couple hundred who are going to hold out to the bitter end."
DC is not altogether doomed for extinction in New York.
The subway has run on DC since it first began operating a century ago and will continue to do so.
But as a public utility, after almost 123 years of faithful service, give or take the occasional blackout, DC is quietly taking its last rounds before the lights go out.

The argument was convincing, but wrong.
Short-term interest rates are higher now, but long-term rates are nearly the same.
Now, points out Kerry Reilly of Bridgewater Associates, traders are expecting long-term rates to rise in 2005, but not nearly so much as they had wrongly forecast for 2004.
The housing market lives on, with some measures showing American house prices rising at a record rate, as are American spending patterns.
That is one reason the American trade deficit has risen to record levels, and that in turn is a reason for the widespread expectation that the dollar must continue to fall.

Longer term, it is hard to see how the United States can withstand a current account deficit of more than 5 percent of gross domestic product.
But, in fact, the trend can continue as long as foreigners are willing to take dollars for their cars, toys and clothing, and not insist on exchanging the dollar for other currencies.
And that means they must find acceptable dollar-denominated assets in which to invest their dollars.
A few years ago, foreigners were happy to buy American stocks, but that demand has almost vanished.
In 2000, foreigners were net buyers of $458 billion of American securities, with 38 percent of that amount going into stocks.

Contrarians could argue that is a positive indicator: foreign investors rarely show good market timing in most parts of the world, presumably for want of local knowledge.
So foreigners' lack of interest in American stocks could be a sign that the stock market is not near a peak.

But it also means that they must do something else with their dollars, and that has led to huge purchases of Treasury and corporate bonds.
At first glance American bonds might seem unattractive given low interest rates and the prospect of a decline in the dollar that could more than offset the interest income for foreign holders.
But so far foreigners' desire to keep the dollar from tumbling -- and hurting their own economies -- has led them to keep buying bonds.
Asian central banks, particularly those in China and Japan, have been voracious buyers of Treasuries.

As this year begins, huge sums have been wagered in one form or another that the Chinese will finally let their currency appreciate, no longer fixing its rate to the dollar.
The Chinese have warned that they will not act as long as the speculators are active, but that warning does not appear to have deterred many who have sought to evade currency controls and acquire yuan that they expect to rise in value.
When Asian currencies do increase, the cost of imported goods will rise in America, producing inflation.
But it is not clear what impact that will have on the stock market.
A falling dollar would make American stocks look cheaper overseas, which could stimulate buying.
But a fear that the dollar would keep falling could frighten foreigners away from American stocks.

"That's fantasyland in the financial situation they find themselves in," he added, given that Mitsubishi's partner, DaimlerChrysler, ceased financing the company last year in a rancorous split.

Among the Big Three automakers, Chrysler was the bright spot last year, buoyed by continued strength in boldly styled new products like the Chrysler 300 sedan.
At Daimler, which includes Mercedes, sales rose 6.3 percent last month, according to Ward's, which adjusts sales figures for the number of selling days in comparable months.
For the year, Daimler's share of the United States market rose to 14.4 percent from 14.1 percent in 2003, according to Autodata.
But many analysts say it is only a matter of time before Toyota, the fourth-largest seller of cars and trucks in the United States, surpasses DaimlerChrysler and breaks up the traditional Big Three.

But even as groups opposed to Mr. Bush's call for personal accounts intensify their efforts, the White House is still trying to develop a plan that can hold Republicans together while attracting at least a handful of Democrats in Congress, say administration officials, conservative activists, members of Congress and economists.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The main issues, they said, are whether Mr. Bush should back a proposal to reduce substantially the guaranteed government retirement benefit through a change in the way the benefit is calculated, and whether workers should be allowed to contribute all of their Social Security payroll taxes into their accounts or only a part.
The indications so far, they said, are that Mr. Bush will stick with his inclination to reduce scheduled benefits to assure the retirement system's long-term solvency, and that he will back smaller accounts than many of his supporters would like.
But to bridge the gap between the sides in the debate, they said, the administration is considering several proposals, including phasing in increases in the size of the accounts over many years or allowing lower-income workers to invest a higher proportion of their wages in private accounts than upper-income people would be permitted to invest.
One group of Republicans is pressing the administration to make the accounts as big as possible, preferably permitting the investment of all or nearly all of the 6.2 percent levy on wages that individuals contribute to Social Security.
(Under all proposals, employers would continue to pay an additional 6.2 percent tax on each employee's wages up to a wage cap that this year is $90,000.)
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Many of the same Republicans have also come out forcefully against a proposal to deal with Social Security's long-term financial problems by reducing the part of future retirement benefits that would come from the government.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Their approach is embodied in legislation introduced in Congress by Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, and Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.
Their plan would allow investment of 6 percent of the wages subject to the payroll tax and would not mandate across-the-board reductions in scheduled benefits.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That approach is viewed warily by many other Republicans.
Those Republicans say that diverting money that would otherwise go to pay benefits into the private accounts would lead to a sharp spike in the budget deficit in the short run.
They say the approach would also raise what they say is a false expectation that Social Security's problems can be addressed without any painful steps.
But the approach has been embraced by some other high-profile Republicans, who say it would be a bold move to harness the power of markets to address social and economic issues and would in the long run leave the nation in much stronger financial condition.
"The president should go for a very large account because it's going to take exactly the same amount of energy to get a large account as a small one, and you get a dramatically bigger reward with a large account," said Newt Gingrich, a Republican and former House speaker.
"And anything that changes benefits on an involuntary basis will allow the Democrats, the AARP and the unions to beat our brains in.
It isn't politically doable."

But another camp, which includes many of the White House economic advisers, supports reducing the guaranteed benefit by switching from a system that calculates the initial benefit a worker receives at retirement based on how fast wages are growing throughout the economy.
In its place would be a formula setting the initial benefit based on how fast prices rise.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Since wages tend to grow faster than prices, the shift would sharply reduce the growth of benefits in coming decades, helping close the projected gap between how much money Social Security takes in and how much it pays out.
But critics, including most Democrats, say the change would leave future retirees unable to keep up with improvements in living standards.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The camp that favors the shift in calculating benefits has also tended to favor limiting contributions to the personal accounts to 2 percent or 3 percent of the wages subject to the payroll tax, in part to hold down the need for the government to borrow hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars in coming decades.
Some economists and business groups that support Mr. Bush on Social Security say financial markets are already jittery about the government's ability to rein in the budget and trade deficits and that more borrowing could lead to a faster fall in the value of the dollar, higher interest rates and slower economic growth.
But there has been a wave of signals from the White House recently about where he seems to be headed.

"You may know that there is a small number of conservatives who prefer to push only for investment accounts and make no effort to adjust benefits, therefore making no effort to address this fundamental structural problem," Mr. Wehner said in the message.
"In my judgment, that's a bad idea.
We simply cannot solve the Social Security problem with personal retirement accounts alone."
Similarly, White House officials have made no secret that they are most comfortable with proposals that hold the size of the accounts to well below the 6 percent proposal in the Ryan-Sununu bill.
They often point to plans like one developed in 2001 by Mr. Bush's Social Security commission that would allow lower-income workers to place up to 4 percent of their wages into their accounts, up to a cap of $1,000.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That dollar cap would also apply to people at higher income levels, though, meaning the percentage of their income they could invest through the accounts would be considerably less -- barely 1 percent for someone earning $90,000.
Seeking to head off unhappiness among Republicans who want Mr. Bush to take the bolder route, White House officials have been emphasizing the importance of unifying behind whatever plan has the best chance of being signed into law.
In his e-mail message, Mr. Wehner said that achieving Mr. Bush's basic goals of putting Social Security on sound financial footing while adding personal accounts would "rank as one of the most significant conservative governing achievements ever."
If Mr. Bush chooses too cautious an approach, "the enthusiasm among a lot of conservatives will wane," said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and activist who just founded an advocacy group, the Free Enterprise Foundation, to push action on issues including Social Security and tax reform.

For factory workers, the December numbers provided no hint of better times ahead, even though American exports have climbed sharply in the last year.
The figure released Friday means that the economy has edged close to the number of jobs that existed before the 2001 recession began.
But that job growth has lagged far behind the population, which has climbed by more than 10 million people since then.
After declining by more than 2 million jobs over the next two years, employment climbed back to 132.3 million jobs in December.
That number is expected to be revised up by about 200,000 jobs next month, when the Labor Department makes an annual statistical revision based on new unemployment insurance data.

But the dollar's fall has increased returns for some debt, particularly Russian and Korean bonds denominated in local currencies.

Mohamed El-Erian, who runs the Pimco Emerging Markets Bond fund, which was up 11.8 percent in 2004 and about 17 percent, annualized, in the last three years, is cautious.
"There is a big elephant in the room," he said.
"How will the world account for the current account deficit that has been mounting for the United States?"
If rates in the United States spike up because investors lose confidence, he said, the impact could be rough for emerging markets, which tend to decline in times of volatility.
Mr. El-Erian said that in such circumstances, many investors would likely prefer the safest and most stable currencies, so they would put their money into United States bonds, rather than those of emerging markets.

Is there a reason to put a small portion of one's savings into emerging-markets funds?
With interest rates in the United States still relatively low, yields on Brazilian government 10-year bonds, for example, are more than 8 percent, almost double that of comparable Treasuries.
And if investors believe that specific emerging-market countries are improving their credit worthiness, their bonds could become more valuable.

But several analysts say investors should hedge their bets.
Dollar-denominated bonds also tend to be traded more widely on international markets.
GENERALLY, analysts also say that during periods of volatility, it is better to hold bonds of shorter duration, which are less vulnerable to shifts in interest rates.
But even efforts to protect against global volatility, and against problems in individual markets, may not be enough to insulate investors against some jaw-dropping fluctuations.

The sources of that volatility are varied.
Late February is now the time frame mentioned by the White House for unveiling President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security.
The timing is no accident.
By waiting until then, the president will conveniently avoid having to include the cost of privatization -- as much as $2 trillion in new government borrowing over the next 10 years -- in his 2006 budget, expected in early February.
In this and other ways, the administration is manipulating information -- a tacit, yet devastating, acknowledgement, we believe, that an informed public would reject privatizing Social Security.
For the record:

The administration has suggested that it would be justified in borrowing some $2 trillion to establish private accounts because doing so would head off $10 trillion in future Social Security liabilities.
It's bad enough that the $10 trillion is a highly inflated figure, intended to overstate a problem that is reasonably estimated at $3.7 trillion or even considerably less.
Written in early January by Peter Wehner, the president's director of strategic initiatives and a top aide to Karl Rove, the president's political strategist, the memo states unequivocally that under a privatized system, only drastic benefit cuts -- not borrowing -- would relieve Social Security's financial problem.
"If we borrow $1-2 trillion to cover transition costs for personal savings accounts" without making benefit cuts, Mr. Wehner wrote, "we will have borrowed trillions and will still confront more than $10 trillion in unfunded liabilities.
This could easily cause an economic chain reaction: the markets go south, interest rates go up, and the economy stalls out."
At a recent press conference, Mr. Bush exaggerated the timing of the system's shortfall by saying that Social Security would cross the "line into red" in 2018.
According to Congress's budget agency, the system comes up short in 2052; according to the system's trustees, the date is 2042.
The year 2018 is when the system's trustees expect they will have to begin dipping into the Social Security trust fund to pay full benefits.
In suggesting that 2018 is doomsyear, the president is reinforcing a false impression that the trust fund is a worthless pile of I.O.U.
's -- as detractors of Social Security so often claim.
The facts are different: since 1983, payroll taxes have exceeded benefits, with the excess tax revenue invested in interest-bearing Treasury securities.
(An alternative would be to, say, put the money in a mattress.)
That accumulating interest and the securities themselves make up the Social Security trust fund.
If the trust fund's Treasury securities are worthless, someone better tell investors throughout the world, who currently hold $4.3 trillion in Treasury debt that carries the exact same government obligation to pay as the trust fund securities.
The president is irresponsible to even imply that the United States might not honor its debt obligations.
"The secretary will make the case that reform is needed to guarantee retirement benefits for today's youth, given the system's insolvency," said Robert Nichols, a spokesman for Mr.
Snow.
"The byproduct will put the nation's fiscal affairs in order by addressing the $10 trillion in unfunded obligations, a move that will be well received by the financial markets."

But several Wall Street economists expressed doubts about the potential impact on interest rates from floating hundreds of billions of dollars of additional government bonds at a time when it is not clear how the Bush administration is planning to reduce the existing budget deficit.
"The overall impact on the Treasury market would be negative," wrote Kathleen Bostjancic, a senior Merrill Lynch economist, who estimated that the administration plan could lead to increased government borrowing of $54 billion to $120 billion a year for the next 20 years.
Administration officials argue that the new borrowing should have no impact on the market, because investors already know the government faces at least $3.7 trillion in unfunded Social Security obligations over the next 75 years -- $10.4 trillion if projected over an "infinite horizon."

Supporters of the proposal say bond investors have already accepted the argument that any extra borrowing will only be transitional and will be repaid in future decades.

Other analysts note that the increased government borrowing will be offset by the money that flows into personal savings accounts.
"It would be a wash, with no change to overall savings," said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor.

Indeed, thus far bond investors have shown little discomfort about the prospect of vast additional federal borrowing.
Even as President Bush has made it clear that overhauling Social Security is his top domestic priority, long-term interest rates have remained very low, at about 4.2 percent.
But many Wall Street analysts say that bond investors have not yet focused on what the future impact of the plan might be if it became law.
"There is no question that the markets have not reacted negatively," John Lipsky, a supporter of personal Social Security accounts who is chief economist at J.P. Morgan Chase.
"Is it because they are O.K.
with it, or is because they don't think it will happen?
My guess is that a lot of people haven't thought very clearly about it."

A number of economists argue that a substantial need for additional Treasury borrowing over the next decade or two could put extra pressure on interest rates relatively soon, while future benefits are so uncertain that most bond market investors do not take them into account when deciding where to put their money.

"The government has no legal obligation to pay anything in the future," said Richard Berner, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley.
"But once the debt is issued, it will be out there with the full faith and credit of the government behind it.
The benefits -- that's a different story."
Wall Street support is crucial to Mr. Bush's plans.
Financial firms would end up managing much of the money that people would be allowed to divert, under Mr. Bush's approach, from payroll taxes to personal accounts.

Despite the apparent windfall in business that could create, many Wall Street executives are less than enthusiastic about administering tens of millions of very small accounts if, as is likely, the government forces them to charge much lower fees than on traditional mutual funds.

But administration officials have already signaled that the government would probably take responsibility for accounts of less than $5,000, relieving financial companies from dealing with millions of accounts that would probably be unprofitable.
"I think Wall Street will react fairly favorably," said Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of Citigroup, at a conference of economists last weekend.

Far more important is support from bond market investors.
If investors gag at the prospect of vast new federal borrowing, the value of Treasury bonds could plunge and interest rates would rise.
Even a hint of panic in the bond markets would be enough to kill support for Mr. Bush's plans in Congress.

Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a bond-market research firm in New York, said bond investors might become inured to huge government borrowing -- about $1.8 trillion in additional federal debt over the last four years.

But Mr. Crandall said the Social Security plan could require less borrowing than expected, if only because people might adopt personal accounts more reluctantly than either Mr. Bush or his critics anticipate.
Few specialists, however, accept the administration's argument that the huge borrowing years ahead would have no impact on Treasury prices.

Bond investors would be confronted with a very tangible deluge of new Treasury securities to buy and a much hazier promise to reduce borrowing in 30 to 60 years as the government cuts back on future Social Security benefits.

"What if the government comes under pressure to bail out people in the future?"
asked Ms. Bostjancic of Merrill Lynch.
"You could have even more borrowing."
"Theoretically, if we are all sitting in Bonds 101, the math makes sense.
But I think the actual market reaction would be different."

Administration officials have said they also would like to drastically change the way future benefits are calculated, indexing them to rises in consumer prices rather than to increases in wages.
Because wages grow faster than prices over the long term, congressional analysts estimate the change would reduce a person's initial retirement benefit in 2065 by more than 40 percent from what is promised under current law.
"I don't know how you can figure out a law that says what benefits will be in 75 years," Mr. Berner said.
As a result, he continued, investors could conclude that the future cuts were unrealistic and that Mr. Bush's plan would ultimately make borrowing higher rather than lower."
In remarks set for delivery on Wednesday, Mr. Evans cautioned that China's surplus, and what United States officials describe as unfair practices, including alleged government subsidies to exporters and patent violations, could spark retaliation.

"There is no connection between employment and our trade with China," Mr. Griswold said.
"But even if the finding of 1.5 million jobs is correct, it is spread over one decade and a half and that mounts to less than 1 percent of job displacement over the entire period."
Instead of focusing solely on job losses, Mr. Griswold said the report should have included the money China invests in United States Treasury bills that keeps interest rates down.
China's exports of everything from clothing to consumer electronics have been rising rapidly for 2004, and were 33 percent higher last month than in 2003, its ministry of commerce announced.
But high oil prices combined with China's attempts to build emergency oil reserves inflated the cost of the country's imports, until recently offsetting the big expansion of exports.
Lower oil prices are now allowing China's remarkable export performance to show up in bigger and bigger trade surpluses.

To prevent the yuan from rising in value, China's central bank has been buying up the extra dollars flowing into the country from the trade surpluses and from growing investment by multinationals and speculators alike.
The December trade surplus and the accumulation of foreign currency are so large that they are certain to bring renewed calls for Beijing to let the yuan appreciate, which could limit somewhat the competitiveness of Chinese exports, economists said.
But Chinese leaders have been resisting such calls for more than two years, and may prove just as intransigent now, the economists warned.
"The pressure will grow because of the simultaneous release of rapid growth in foreign exchange reserves and record trade surplus," said Desmond Supple, the managing director of Asian research in the Singapore office of Barclays Capital.
But he added, "There's a very sizable difference between political pressure and a change in policy."

Forward contracts based on the value of the yuan a year from now were trading in Singapore late Tuesday at the equivalent of 7.89 yuan to the dollar.
That suggests investors expect the currency to appreciate from its current, government-managed level of 8.28 to the dollar.
The contracts are not for the actual delivery of yuan because of the many restrictions that Beijing still imposes on money flowing in and out of China.

It will be a tall order to prod the current Congress, purring with fresh incumbency, into scrapping the commission for an independent body of true regulators who are invested in voters, not fund-raisers.

The Paris Club's move came after calls last month by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany for the creditors to extend some form of debt relief to the countries hit by the tsunami.
So far, only Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles have expressed interest in the moratorium.
Thailand, which is relatively wealthier and less indebted, has declined the offer.
Indonesia initially asked for a two-year freeze on debt repayments, with government officials saying it would cost $2.2 billion to rebuild Aceh.

The picture may soon become clearer.
The World Bank is already preparing an initial assessment of the cost of rebuilding Aceh in time for a meeting next week of the Consultative Group for Indonesia, an umbrella organization headed by the World Bank that includes the country's 30 largest foreign lenders.

News of the Paris Club's move raised initial fears that it could harm Indonesia's credit ratings, thereby raising the interest rate the country and its companies would have to pay lenders.
Normally, the country's official debts carry a condition that they not discriminate against any other group of lenders, which means that any debt relief Indonesia may receive from one group of creditors would have to apply to all.
"Because this is a Paris Club initiative only, it is understood they would not force comparable treatment with private-sector debt," said Agost Benard, an associate director at the Standard & Poor's ratings agency in Singapore.

The precise terms of any subsequent moratorium, he said, would have to be worked out between Indonesia and each member of the Paris Club: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.
One central question, analysts said, will be ensuring that the debt payments are directed specifically to Aceh and not diverted by corrupt officials.
Past aid to Indonesia has suffered from widespread "leakage," and bribes are a common feature in Indonesian business.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has asked a nongovernmental agency to set up a program to monitor the aid.
Lending to a broad range of companies is on the rise, with $1.3 trillion in financings completed last year, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation, a research firm.

The biggest boom is in loans to highly indebted companies.
"There's been a party going on for the last year," said Mark Gold, who manages $4 billion in loan portfolios in New York for Trust Company of the West.
The market has been so robust, he said, that there will eventually "be some blowups, probably within the next year or two."

Buyers of bank loans issued by companies like these are basing their optimism, at least in part, on an improving economy that could enhance the prospects of even the weakest businesses.
Defaults on corporate loans have fallen to 1.01 percent of loans outstanding at the end of December, down from 2.25 percent a year earlier, according to S.&P.
That is the lowest default rate since the firm began tracking this data in 1998.
A growing number of investors are also attracted by the floating rates paid to lenders, at a time when interest rates are on the rise.
Loan rates fluctuate based on the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark that borrowers use to reset the rate on their loans, often within three months.

One indication of the popularity of these loans is that assets in mutual funds specializing in corporate loans, known as prime rate funds, rose nearly 58 percent, to $25 billion, according to S.&P.
Still, investors and analysts worry that lenders are taking imprudent risks that will haunt them when the economy eventually slows.

"The credit markets are incredibly complacent," Mr. Lewitt said.
"We're in a huge bubble but nobody knows when it will burst."
Analysts say the high prices at which loans are trading, the low returns that investors are willing to accept, and the weak credit ratings attached to recent offerings are all signs of an overheated market.

A rising percentage of companies raising money in the loan market carry low credit ratings, according to S.&P.
Loans rated B+ or lower accounted for 35 percent of leveraged loans raised last year, up from just 8 percent two years earlier.
Demand is so intense to invest in loans that even companies with uncertain prospects have been able to raise money at rates that got progressively cheaper over the course of the year.
By the end of 2004, companies with debt rated BB could borrow at 1.96 percentage points above the benchmark Libor rate, down from 2.45 percentage points above Libor a year earlier.

In November, for example, R.H. Donnelley, the publisher of yellow page directories, replaced most of a $2.5 billion loan it raised less than three months earlier with a new offering priced 0.50 percentage point cheaper, at 1.75 percentage points above Libor, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation.
The rapid pace of these refinancings is good business for the banks, which earn a fee each time they arrange one of these deals.

"This was one of the busiest years ever" for such deals, said Andrew O'Brien, managing director and head of loan syndication at J.P. Morgan, the largest arranger of corporate loans.
"Companies are eager to obtain as attractive a rate as possible."

Investors who hold these loans often feel they have little choice but to agree to these refinancings, even though their returns on the loans are sharply reduced.
That is because cash is pouring in to bank loan funds at such a fast clip, these fund managers are desperate for a place to invest the cash.
"The banks will tell you that if you don't do this there are plenty of people who will," said a manager of a loan portfolio at a large investment firm.
He says he selectively agrees to such refinancings, as long as he is comfortable with the company's underlying prospects.
"Otherwise, it's a question of where do you reinvest the money?"

Another sign that demand for loans outstrips supply is the lofty prices at which leveraged loans trade.
Nearly 30 percent of leveraged loans trades above 100 percent of face value, according to Markit Group, which tracks loan prices, even though a company redeeming the loan will not pay more than 100 cents.
"Everyone owns Charter," he said.
"It's so big and liquid."
Investors who buy such loans are gambling that the issuers of the debt will not look to replace the loans with new ones anytime soon, so that the interest they are paid in the interim compensates for the high price.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Still, that can be a risky assumption, traders say, because most bank loans, unlike bonds, can be called, or repurchased, at any time.
And with more than a third of all leveraged loans refinanced over the last year, there is a chance that the loan could quickly be replaced.
Investors are increasingly willing to overpay for loans, said another investor, because cash is flooding in to their funds so quickly and they need a place to put it.

One investor said he was finding so few loans trading at reasonable prices that he was sitting on a large cash position.

Then, in June 2001, the five-story brick town house next door, at the corner of East 50th Street, was sold for $8.8 million to Mr. Rupp, 71, who owns a restaurant called Billie's in Key West, Fla.

A short time later, Mr. Boyd said, he was contacted by an architect working for Mr. Rupp.

During a visit to the property this month, Angel Gonzalez, the project supervisor for Mr. Campus's contractor, the Yates Restoration Group, pointed to two locations at the front and back of the building where large sections of brickwork jut several feet above the base of the upper balconies on the Rudolph penthouse.
Mr. Gonzalez also said the brickwork appears to have been anchored with metal ties into the stucco on Mr. Campus's side, which may not be strong enough to hold it.
From inside the penthouse, a visitor can look through windows at sections of brickwork with nothing but mortar to hold them in place.

"It's dangerous," Mr. Gonzalez said.
"It's bad in every sense of the word."
While the city had enough concerns about the wall's structural integrity to threaten to revoke Mr. Rupp's permit, Ms. Fink of the Buildings Department said that in many cases a homeowner has the right to build up to the property line, even if the work covers his neighbor's windows.

"The aspect of the windows is not one that is particularly relevant for us," she said.

Another Duplex for Grasso

Lorraine Grasso, the wife of Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, paid $2.3 million in cash last October for a duplex condominium in a converted warehouse building in TriBeCa, according to a deed filed with the city.
The new unit occupies part of the building's cellar and ground floor and the two units are not contiguous.
He would not discuss the Grassos' reason for putting the new unit in Mrs. Grasso's name.

The surge in November was to the second-highest monthly total ever, trailing the $105.1 billion figure reached in May 2003.

Common stock investment by foreigners surged in November to $14.5 billion, the highest since May 2001.

Perhaps the most intriguing change came in the Caribbean countries, where many hedge funds are based for tax reasons.
After being heavy buyers of Treasury securities early in the year, they were net sellers of $22.2 billion in November, cutting their holdings to $76.2 billion.
Many analysts have argued that one reason Treasury yields have remained relatively low is that hedge funds have been borrowing at low short-term interest rates and using the money to buy higher-yielding Treasury securities.
As long as short-term rates do not rise abruptly, the hedge funds are able to make a profit.

The data indicates that in November a lot of the hedge funds may have decided to bail out of these so-called carry trades, and that helped push the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note up to 4.41 percent on Dec. 2, from 4.02 percent at the end of October.
The yield has since fallen to 4.18 percent.

While the amounts paid to retiring workers would not change immediately, some companies would have to increase their reported pension liabilities as much as 30 percent.
To bring things back into balance, some may contribute more money to their pension funds -- a boon to participants, but a jolt to shareholders, who may have thought that the money would be used for business operations.
Other companies may delete attractive features from their plans, to bring the cost back down.
There is precedent for such a cutback.
Indeed, the accounting board's proposal comes as the pension system itself is under pressure.
Many companies, citing the burden of providing retirement benefits, have cut back, converted or closed their plans.
At the same time, the Bush administration is proposing changes in both the way companies set aside money to pay for future benefits, and the way they pay to support the federal system of insuring traditional pensions.
Business groups have warned that if companies are pushed too hard, they may stop offering pensions altogether.

The looming changes in accounting rules are expected to be strongly opposed by companies.
The staff of the Financial Accounting Standards Board hopes to present the draft of a proposal by the end of March.

"That's where a lot of people are going to be giving us a lot of pushback," Mr. O'Callaghan said.
The accounting board is grappling with something of an open secret in American business: the current accounting rules for pensions allow companies to underestimate, if not conceal, their liabilities legally.

The board's efforts to improve reporting mirror recent administration proposals to overhaul the rules that companies follow in funding their pension plans.
Both sets of rules are now widely thought to obscure the economic reality of a pension plan, sometimes allowing insolvency to grow, undetected by all but the best-informed insiders.
It thus went for several years without making any contributions.
Now, however, the company is arguing in bankruptcy court that it can no longer fund the plans and that the government must take them over.
The particular issues that the accounting board is looking at represent only "a sliver" of the overall problem of pension accounting, Mr. O'Callaghan said.

Other experts agreed.
"They're trying to repair a broken heating system in a house that's falling down," said Jeremy Gold, a consulting actuary to the Financial Accounting Standards Board and an economist who has criticized current pension accounting rules.
"They're headed in the right direction.
They're sending some signals about what a rewrite of the pension rules is going to look like."

Even so, the board may have a fight on its hands.
If it approves its staff's proposal, public comment will then be solicited.
The board has set a year-end target to put the rule into effect, but issues raised in the comment period could take months to sort out, pushing that deadline back.
"Nothing gets done here fast," Mr. O'Callaghan said, recalling that it took more than 10 years to complete a rule on accounting for stock options.
In that case, Congress weighed in, threatening to reduce the board's funds.
The board, based in Norwalk, Conn., also gets contributions from business and accounting firms.

Its current project was initially supposed to change the way companies calculate the value of a kind of pension plan known as a cash-balance plan.
Thousands of companies, employing millions of people, have one or the other of these two types of pension plans.
Lucent Technologies, I.B.M., Avon Products, AT&T, Colgate-Palmolive, Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba America, Wells Fargo, Qwest Communications, Bank of America, Cummins and Delta Air Lines are among the hundreds of companies with cash-balance pension plans.

Delphi and U.S. Steel are among many companies that have conventional pension plans, allowing departing workers to take lump sums.
So do American Airlines and Delta with the pension plans for their pilots.
A cash-balance plan is a hybrid design, combining features of a conventional defined-benefit pension plan with those of a 401(k) plan.
The company sets aside money to pay the benefits in a pooled trust fund, as it would for a traditional pension plan.
But it provides each worker with regular statements, reporting the amount of benefits as an individual account balance, like a 401(k) balance.
There are, in fact, no individual accounts, but expressing the benefits this way is said to make employees understand and value them more.

Each year, an employee's balance increases, as the sponsoring company credits the account with interest at some specified rate.
Often, the rate is linked to a conservative market rate, like that for Treasury bills.
At AT&T, for example, the cash-balance plan has recently been offering employees interest credits at 4 percent a year.

The discrepancy in accounting arises when the company calculates the total value of these obligations for its annual report.
It must again factor in an interest rate, because pension values vary inversely with interest rates, much as bond prices do.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But in this calculation, the crediting rate is not used.
The current accounting standard for pensions lets companies use a high-quality bond rate instead.
AT&T used 6 percent, according to its annual report for 2003.
It is the difference between these rates that troubles the accounting rule makers.
Because of the inverse relationship, using 6 percent produces a smaller pension value for the annual report than the one reported to workers in their statements.

Actuaries say that correcting the reported value in AT&T's case would mean increasing it by about 24 percent, citing a rule of thumb that every percentage-point change in the interest rate causes about a 12 percent change in the value of the benefits.
Conforming to the accounting board's approach might require increasing the amount owed to active workers by 24 percent, or $614 million.
That would increase AT&T's total pension debt to its work force to about $10.6 billion.
These adjustments would vary at different companies, depending on the interest rates used and the ages of the work force.

The accounting board's work on cash-balance plans showed that companies also use two interest rates when calculating lump-sum distributions, with the result that they have also been reporting smaller pension obligations to investors than the amounts workers are really allowed to take.
About half of all workers at big companies are currently allowed to take lump sums, according to Mark G. Beilke, director of employee benefits research at Milliman USA.
The practice is much more common among plans for salaried white-collar workers than those for union or hourly workers, he said.
Among the companies affected because they offer cash-balance plans or pay lump sums, some, like Toshiba and Wells Fargo, have written letters to the accounting board expressing opposition to the accounting change.

"The board's tentative conclusions could result in large charges to earnings for many companies," wrote Richard D. Levy, the controller of Wells Fargo, in a letter sent in May 2004.
"These companies could conceivably implement changes to their pension plans to minimize the impact of the accounting changes on their financial results.
These plan changes may ultimately result in reductions of pension benefits for employees."
Some, including I.B.M., Qwest and Colgate-Palmolive, did not respond to requests for comment.

Many actuaries find the accounting board's new approach disturbing, because it challenges core concepts of the actuarial approach to pensions.
Years ago, cash-balance plans were marketed to companies on the very feature the accounting board now considers incorrect: the interest-rate differential that made them look cheaper than they turn out to be.
"There is substantial leverage in this assumption," said a 1985 promotional brochure on cash-balance plans by Kwasha Lipton, an actuarial firm that has become a part of Mellon Financial.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

"A '5 percent of pay' plan might require a contribution of only 4 percent of pay, after a realistic investment differential is taken into account."
When Kwasha Lipton was writing this, that's what all actuaries believed.
The right answer was to say that you could give $5 at the cost of $4."
Correction: January 27, 2005, Thursday Because of an editing error, a front-page article last Thursday about a proposal by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that would require many companies to give a more accurate financial picture of their pension plans misstated the source of the group's financing.
Since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, the board has received funds through mandatory fees charged to many publicly traded companies; it no longer receives voluntary contributions from companies or accounting firms.

What did he look like?
A hero, of course.
With part of its nose missing, it depicts an idealized youthful face, with deep-set eyes and a shaggy mass of hair fronted by the cowlick over the right eye, a hallmark of Alexander's features.
Another marble head, from the early third century B.C., is a little more emotive, showing the king with the same cowlicked hair mass, but with a slightly open mouth and the characteristic tilt of the neck he was said to exhibit.
His likenesses -- the most famous, by Lysippos, has not been found -- may have given a leonine quality to his head not only to impart a godlike appearance, but also to offset his average stature.
In winning the many battles of his campaign, Alexander was helped enormously by the superior quality of Greek weapons, developed -- the catalog tells us -- in the conviction that warfare was the utmost virtue, and that every citizen should be willing to lay down his life for his land.
And the many battles fought by the Greeks resulted in ever more sophisticated arms and strategies for deploying them.

A display of terra cotta figures, manufactured in Pella in the fourth century B.C.
and the Hellenistic period, gives a good view of the basics of dress among upper- and middle-class women.
Each of two typical figures from the third century B.C.
is shown wearing next to the body a long, close-fitting chiton, of wool or linen, and over it a second garment, a himation, also of wool or linen, that could be draped in various ways.
In both, the hair is long but done up: parted in the middle, drawn to either side in curls and arranged in a bun at the back of the head.
Traces of pink or red pigment linger on the lips and hair.
Fed by abundant gold from Macedonian-controlled mines in the Pangaion area, they were evolving in this era to a point of highly sophisticated craftsmanship.
And there is a good deal of it on display: earrings, rings, bracelets, armlets, necklaces, pendants, medallions and buttons -- many rescued from the graves to which they accompanied their owners -- all attesting that the stuff was no less in demand than it is today.
Although not as interesting or elaborate as later Etruscan jewelry, there are a few dazzlers here.
One is a pair of gold drop earrings topped by elaborate honeysuckle palmettes; dangling from each is a figure of Ganymede being carried off by an eagle.
The spread wings of the eagle, actually Zeus in disguise, form a theatrical backdrop for the figure.

But the most spectacular display is a gold ensemble from the tomb of an unknown noblewoman buried in an important part of the vast cemetery of Aigai, once the Macedonian capital.
Lying in one of the few graves untouched by robbers, she was wrapped in a lavish, gold-embellished shroud, now vanished but leaving in place its copious adornments of jewelry, gold ribbons and rosettes.

The outline of her body, as indicated by the numerous ornaments, is on display in a special case.
Large gold fibulae and pins that held her clothes together; a gold-strap diadem and three gold tubal adornments for her hair; gold-strap earrings; a heavy, gold-beaded necklace and pendant; sandals with silver-covered soles; and many other bedazzlements help make this 1998 discovery remarkable.
These are some of the high points of the show, which, if not the strongest or most definitive exhibition on Alexander and his world, is the kind of display that could tempt a viewer into further explorations.
"Alexander the Great: Treasures From an Epic Era of Hellenism" is at the Onassis Cultural Center, 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212)486-4448, through April 16.

According to the corporation's proposed 2005 budget, if Medicaid reimbursement rates stay unchanged, and the number of patients remains at 2004 levels, it could be breaking even by the end of the year.
That is a big if, though.
Governor Pataki's 2005 budget proposal, announced on Tuesday, includes $1.1 billion in "cost containment" initiatives aimed at Medicaid, including reductions in reimbursement rates to hospitals and nursing homes.
And since state Medicaid expenditures are matched by the federal government, any effect of Mr. Pataki's reductions would be compounded.
Hospital advocates are also wary of the coming budget proposals from President Bush, who has expressed a desire to curb federal Medicaid costs.
As a "safety net" health care system, the medical center has a higher percentage of poor and uninsured patients than other hospitals in Nassau County.

County and hospital officials say it is too early to tell if Mr. Pataki's budget will make it through the State Legislature.
Without specific details, neither Mr. Kane nor any other official would make predictions about the specific impact of Medicaid cuts, only saying they would oppose them.

Kevin Dahill, president of the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council, said that based on similar cuts and taxes that Mr. Pataki has proposed in the past, the corporation stands to lose around $6 million.
The Nassau county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, has been at the forefront of discussions about Medicaid in New York State, crusading for caps on the share of Medicaid costs that are paid by the counties.

"Merely redistributing the burden is not enough," the governor said.
"The state can no more afford to pay for the current and future costs of Medicaid than counties can."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

To some, the implication was that a push for Medicaid caps is a push for Medicaid cuts.
"I think people concerned about what these cuts will do to the Nassau County Medical Center really need to ask Tom Suozzi what role he played here," said Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan, who is chairman of the State Assembly's health committee.
"Because he has created a lot of the political climate that is generating this volume of cuts."
Mr. Suozzi said that cuts, in principle, are not a bad thing.
"There's no question that in order to reform Medicaid and achieve a cap on the growth at the local level as well as cap the growth at the state level there has to be cost containment," he said, but added that public hospitals, like the Nassau University Medical Center, were entitled to special consideration in putting together a Medicaid budget.
"It's premature to think that after all this success that now because of a speech from the governor that the sky is falling," he said.
"The hospital is stronger than it has been in years."

Arthur A. Gianelli, the deputy county executive for budget and finance, acknowledged the county's awkward position: the governor's proposals could mean millions of dollars in benefits to the county but adversely affect the health care corporation.
"Cooperatively, we can withstand adverse policy changes at the state or federal levels," he said.
Such optimism was nowhere to be found a year ago, when a consulting firm hired by the county released a report concluding that "by virtually any measure, N.H.C.C.
today stands on the brink of financial collapse."

The county has a huge stake in the economic success of the health care corporation; it guaranteed the bond that was issued to get the corporation on its feet in 1999, and if the corporation runs out of money, the county must pay its bills.
This exasperated members of the Civil Service Employees Association, the union that represents most of the corporation's workers, who had been working without a contract since January 2003.
Some critics have charged that the board and some of the upper-level managers of the corporation were appointed or hired for political, not professional, reasons.

In September, the county announced a five-point plan for the hospital's fiscal stability based on the recommendations of the consultant's report.
"While that may have been true 20, 30 years ago, it's certainly not true today.
So what I've looked at it is to say, what's our mission?
And our primary mission is as a safety-net hospital."
The corporation also plans to shut down the 45-year-old A. Holly Patterson nursing home and to build a 480-bed nursing home that would be attached to the hospital.
The strategy also called for various changes in the way day-to-day operations were run, including staffing reductions and some changes in senior management.
As Wednesday's layoffs demonstrate, the difficulties are not over.
"We're a long way from where we can say, 'O.K., we've passed the hump and we're definitely safe,"' said Dr. Rosemarie Guercia, co-director of the Long Island Health Access Monitoring Project.

"In the contract negotiations he's been able to more creative in working with us," she said.
The hospital and the union have tentatively agreed on a new contract, which includes a clause preventing future layoffs unless there is a major shock to the hospital's finances.
Ms. D'Amico expects to bring the contract to the members for a vote in February.
Now that many of the consultant's recommendations have been put into place, the remaining challenge is attracting patients.
Mr. Kane said he was hoping that capital improvements, reduced waiting times and a renewed attention to the outlying community health centers would make the hospital system more accessible.
Officials are also hoping to avoid the bad publicity that has hounded the hospital and nursing home over the past few years.
Along with Mr. Pataki's proposed budget, the patient census, which declined steeply over the last year, is one of those variables that will become clearer in time.
"I'm more optimistic now because I think that Dan Kane and his team are really approaching this professionally," Mr. Kessel said.
But, he added, "I'm going to withhold final judgment."
One of the main talking points in the administration's drive to privatize Social Security is that retirees have nothing to fear.
"If you're a senior receiving your Social Security check, nothing is going to change," President Bush said recently.
Mr. Bush seems to presume that older Americans are indifferent to the future retirement security of their children and grandchildren.
But even taken on its face, the argument does not hold up.
The president promises that under a private retirement scheme, anyone age 55 or older would continue to receive full Social Security benefits.
What he repeatedly fails to mention is that privatization would require some $2 trillion in new borrowing over the next 10 years and an additional $4.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.
That's on top of the trillions that need to be found to cover the costs of Medicare and Medicaid and -- if the president gets his way -- to make this decade's tax cuts permanent.
It's foolhardy to assume that the government could continue to meet all of its obligations, including the payment of Social Security benefits, under such a mountain of debt.
All told, by 2030, when today's 55-year-olds turn 80, the national debt would be as big as the economy itself, according to a calculation by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that uses data from Social Security and the Congressional Budget Office.
To compare, consider that in the last 50 years, national debt has equaled only 38 percent of the economy on average, and that percentage includes the tremendous overhang of debt from World War II.
Large and virtually permanent fiscal imbalances could create severe hardship.
At the least, big and ongoing deficits erode living standards because they reduce the money available for investment in the economy.
At worst, enormous and endless deficits could provoke a loss of investor confidence, leading to higher interest rates and inflation, lower stock and bond prices, less household wealth, less government spending and slower economic growth.
"We understand that deficits matter," he said, insisting that the tight budget Mr. Bush is expected to send to Congress next month should give foreigners and the financial markets the solace they seek.

But should the dollar continue to fall -- if, for example, global investors determined that Mr. Bush did not have the will to hold spending down -- it would not only add to tensions, analysts said.
It might also force up interest rates at home to keep foreigners interested in financing America's need to borrow more than $600 billion a year to cover its gap in the current account.
The current account is the broadest measure of the trade and financial flows into and out of the country.
To be sure, the dollar's fall may never reach crisis levels, and in the last few weeks, after a more or less steady fall of almost 35 percent against the euro and 24 percent against the Japanese yen over the last three years, the dollar has stabilized a bit.
Many experts argue that a further decline, if relatively modest and gradual, is entirely manageable.
Administration officials, along with a number of like-minded economists, contend that the nation's record trade and current account deficits are not particularly worrisome, a reflection more of strong foreign interest in investing in the American economy than any sign of global weakness.

But across Asia and Europe, a wide range of officials and analysts worry that Mr. Bush's economic team may not be up to the challenge of grappling with the issue.
They contend that Washington has retreated from efforts to marshal the biggest economies of the world into a mutual effort at more robust and balanced growth.

Many European politicians and exporters cannot shake the suspicion that the Bush administration, despite its statements supporting a strong currency, has been perfectly happy to watch from the sidelines while the dollar heads down.

At a moment of surging American trade deficits that have reached a record share of economic output, a falling dollar makes American exports more competitive and puts imports from Europe at a particular disadvantage.
"It's hard to tell an entrepreneur to wait two years for a policy to change when he says, 'I've got to deliver my goods tomorrow,"' said Anton Boerner, the president of BGA, the Berlin-based association of wholesalers and exporters.
Mr.
Snow, for his part, paints a vastly different picture of the international economic landscape.
He described the situation as one of America's remaining the economic envy of the world, with the yawning deficits being addressed and little risk that foreigners will rethink the wisdom of lending the United States hundreds of billions of dollars a year to finance the trade gap and to cover the vast borrowing needs of the federal government.

Mr.
Snow suggested some in Europe are seeking a convenient scapegoat, particularly after the tensions over Iraq, to blame for the Continent's own inability to generate stronger growth.

"The current deficit levels are too large," Mr.
Snow said, describing himself as a deficit hawk who sees a chance to cut spending because the American economy is growing again.
"They have to come down, and they will come down."
But deficits aside, he argued, "overwhelmingly the United States is looked at as the model for success."
After years of stagnation in money flowing into the government, "revenues look good," and the turning point will come in a couple of weeks, he said, when Mr. Bush sends a budget to Congress in which "you will see a number of programs that not only don't grow at the rate of inflation, but that decline."

While the budget is a domestic document, assessments of whether it will realistically grapple with the underlying problems and whether Mr. Bush has the political will to push tough measures through Congress may determine whether investors around the world stick with the American economy or head for the exits.
'At a Critical Juncture'

No one knows for sure if the doubts that have already contributed to the dollar's decline will intensify.
Some worry that the markets may conclude that Mr. Bush will put the financing of the Iraq war, military transformation and the costs of revamping Social Security ahead of deficit reduction.

Others fret about the risk that a large, highly leveraged hedge fund or a big bank could be caught betting the wrong way in the markets, touching off a sudden currency sell-off that could have implications for the rest of Mr. Bush's term.

"The projection is that they keep rising," he added, noting that the current account deficit is running over 6 percent of the gross domestic product.

There has not been an economic crisis of significant magnitude since Mr. Bush came to office.
Today the Treasury is regarded as a vastly diminished institution, with comparatively little influence in the White House.
Mr. Bush is seen, rightly or wrongly, as far less comfortable dealing with global economic management than he is sitting in the Situation Room, buried in the details of the Iraqi insurgency or Iran's nuclear threat.

As a result, the weakening dollar, to the minds of many from Hong Kong to Berlin, is a metaphor for a presidency so distracted by national security issues that American economic influence has ebbed.
China Stands Its Ground

Washington's lack of success so far in pressuring China to finally allow its currency to float, or at least appreciate significantly to reflect its vastly stronger economy, is cited as the most striking evidence of Washington's diminished economic influence.
Beijing has used other issues, chiefly the Bush administration's dependence on China to help prevent North Korea's development of nuclear weapons from touching off a wider conflagration, to keep currency demands on the back burner.

The Chinese, like the Japanese in their heyday, have begun to question American economic policy.

It is a subject of enormous sensitivity in Beijing, because of its effect on the breakneck pace of China's economic growth.

Leadership

China is only one piece of the global economic puzzle.
The lack of interest by Mr. Bush and Mr.
Snow to put together a global accord on currency, akin to the Plaza Accord that Mr. Baker organized in 1985, is viewed as evidence that Washington is content with a downward drift of the dollar.
And there is no one to replace the American role.
"It will be a world of chaos without a center," said Hideo Kumano, a senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
Japan itself, after a decade of downward spiral that seems to be ending, has lost all pretense of assuming the mantle of leadership.
Bush administration officials have a deep skepticism bordering on an outright ideological objection to intervening in the markets.

Certainly China, while growing in leaps and bounds, has neither the capacity nor the interest.
"China has a big population and big economic growth, but it is not a mature economic system yet," Mr. Kumano noted.
"I cannot imagine it replacing Europe or Japan in terms of influence in the world economy.
In such a condition, everyone must cope with a world economy where you cannot rely on America."
For all the worries abroad, the Bush administration sees few signs of stress.
"You don't have any major economy now in recession, and volatility is low," Mr. Taylor said.
"Even inflation is contained in the emerging markets."
But the lesson of the 1990's is that currency crises, like the terror strikes of more recent years, are nearly impossible to predict.
"Financing of the U.S. current account deficit has gone more smoothly than many economists were predicting just a few years ago," wrote Roger M. Kubarych, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan research group.

Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban planning at the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, said apprehension over the subway disruptions could lead to an initial weakening of the real estate market.
But with the average price of a New York apartment now at over $1 million, and with interest rates low and the inventory of available properties bone-dry, the market is likely to bounce back.
"Good housing is always attractive," Mr. Moss said.

Historically there has been no fixed correlation between New York property values and direct access to an express subway stop.
Experts say that proximity to good schools, parks and sushi restaurants -- as well as to transportation -- all weighs on a buyer's mind.
Up-and-coming enclaves like Red Hook, Brooklyn, and 23rd Street between 10th and 12th Avenues are virtually off the subway grid.
"We can be assured that eliminating an amenity for a period of years will not be a plus for any area, but how much of a negative depends on many factors," said Michael H. Schill, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former professor of urban planning at the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.
"If a neighborhood is truly on the fringes," Mr. Schill said, "there might be some worry about isolation."

He added that those most affected would be people wanting to move into a neighborhood.
"Those who already live in a neighborhood have good reasons to stay and are unlikely to sell," he explained.

Brokers, who closely monitor the psychology of property acquisition and have unshakable faith in the lure of homeownership, say that nothing can stop a determined buyer, even if the property is in a changing neighborhood rendered less accessible by the subway disruption like Bedford-Stuyvesant, which has recently had an uptick in sale prices.
"If a gorgeous classic Edwardian town house comes on the market in Stuyvesant Heights and is priced between $500,000 and $600,000, you'd still have a bidding war," said Jerry Minsky, a real estate broker at the Corcoran Group's office in Fort Greene.

Correction: February 3, 2005, Thursday An article last Thursday about disruption in service on the A and C subway lines in New York and its effect on residential real estate values referred incorrectly to the Lafayette Avenue station in Brooklyn.
The current "Hurlyburly" (it was also made into a movie in 1998 starring Sean Penn) doesn't have the same gloss, despite its own quota of hip marquee names, and the characters have been stripped of romanticizing charisma.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That sensibility has never translated as effectively in this director's revivals of more conventional classics ("Present Laughter," "The Three Sisters").
But Mr. Elliott is at the top of his form with "Hurlyburly," approaching it with the same mix of clinical hindsight and in-the-moment immediacy that he brought to last season's revival of Wallace Shawn's 1985 play "Aunt Dan and Lemon."
This perspective again uncovers fresh wellsprings of power in a work that turns out to be more than a period piece.
Mr. Elliott goes further than Mr. Nichols did in releasing the characters' hold on the audience's sympathy.
You may occasionally identify with the toxic figures portrayed here, but only with a sharp wince.
The mythic resonance of Tony Walton's set for the Nichols production -- in which windows framed vistas of a lush, junglelike world -- has been exchanged for the slovenly, airless claustrophobia of Derek McLane's rendering of the home shared by two second-tier casting agents, Eddie (Mr. Hawke) and Mickey (Mr. Hamilton).
Their home is a hangout for friends who want to get stoned, get sloshed, get laid.
They include Phil (Bobby Cannavale), a bit actor of thuggish good looks and combustible temperament, and Artie, a leering, avuncular scriptwriter (Wallace Shawn, the author of "Aunt Dan," who is brazenly cast against type in a role created by Jerry Stiller).
Then there are the women, who are passed around as if they were bongs: Darlene (Ms. Posey), a jittery, chic photographer; Donna (Halley Wegryn Gross), a 15-year-old drifter; and Bonnie (Catherine Kellner), a stripper famous for balloon dancing.

They are all surprisingly long-winded, prone to talking jags filled with big words and big concepts, while their attention spans are conversely short.
This means that conversation among them becomes a freewheeling collision course in which connection is arbitrary and bruising.
And while they are always advising one another on how to improve their lives, the only people they are on intimate terms with are their own individual selves.
It is appropriate that when Phil talks about looking at his estranged wife, he remembers seeing a hostile cloud of fog where her face should be.

These jerks are drawn, by performers and playwright, with such fine-grained artistry and accuracy that they are compulsively watchable, giving the lie to the theory that you have to like characters to be engaged by them.
What the show brings out so well is the fractured consciousnesses of people whose moods are determined by their most recent forms of self-medication.
Halfway through this production, it occurred to me that "Hurlyburly" may be the smartest, and certainly the least sentimental, play ever written about life on drugs.

The speech of these coke-snorting, dope-toking, tequilla-swilling characters is circular, repetitive and shot through with abrupt shifts in attitude.
Yet -- and this is a crucial yet -- we are always aware of an aching emotional and intellectual restlessness, fed by a need for clarity, to use one of Eddie's favorite words, in a muddled, superficial environment.

The characters may be victims of the psychobabble, spiritual mantras and film jargon of the world they inhabit.
But they are also perversely struggling to penetrate their self-induced haze.
The production is propelled throughout by a sense of thwarted energy and a crippled quest for substance.
It makes sense that along with the vials of cocaine and baggies of marijuana, a dictionary is always on hand as a consciousness-promoting tool.
As Eddie puts it, pathetically, he is "trying to maintain a, you know, viable relationship with reality."
He continues: "I'm just trying to make certain I haven't drifted off into some, you know, solitary paranoid system of my own totally unfounded and idiosyncratic invention."
Mr. Hawke's persona has always been part angel, part weasel, and he has never put it to better use than here.
He has let his habitually buff body go soft, and he captures with merciless precision the sense of a sharp mind turning flaccid.
His role is taxingly long, with quicksilver adjustments of tone.
But the only speeches he doesn't pull off are the soliloquies about living in the shadow of the neutron bomb.
(Now, as in 1984, the play could benefit from losing at least a half- hour.)

Ms. Posey, a specialist in gamine neurotics, tones down her usual madcap brightness to create an acute study in self-laceration.
(She and Mr. Hawke, by the way, contribute what is sure to be this season's funniest sex scene.)
And Ms. Kellner steers the raucous Bonnie away from the pitfalls of lame victimhood.
There's a survivalist instinct at work in her, though it can't match the armor of affectlessness so persuasively shaped by Ms.
But the evening's most fully realized portrait in an exceptionally vivid gallery comes from Mr. Hamilton, who memorably created a younger disaffected druggie in Kenneth Lonergan's "This Is Our Youth."
Vain and crisply spoken, Mickey is the only character who keeps up appearances within the disintegration of "Hurlyburly."

He has discovered that a chilled, ironic distance is the best defense amid hotter heads.
While the other characters are drowning in a welter of mixed-up feelings, Mickey practices an advanced form of self-anesthesia.
His cynicism is far beyond that of the others, so far as to verge on the inhuman.
Mickey is the character most likely to be alive 10 years after "Hurlyburly" ends.

The "immobilizer" technology used in the keys has been an enormous success.
Texas Instruments alone has its chips in an estimated 150 million keys.
Replacing the key on newer cars can cost hundreds of dollars, but the technology is credited with greatly reducing auto theft.
-- Early versions of in-key chips were relatively easy to clone, but the Texas Instruments chips are considered to be among the best.
Still, the amount of computing the chip can do is restricted by the fact that it has no power of its own; it builds a slight charge from an electromagnetic field from the car's transmitter.
They were able to buy a tag reader directly from the company, which sells kits for $280 on its Web site.

The researchers discovered a critically important fact: the encryption algorithm used by the chip to scramble the challenge uses a relatively short code, known as a key.
The longer the code key, which is measured in bits, the harder it is to crack any encryption system.

The team wrote software that mimics the system, which works through a pattern of challenge and response.
The researchers took each chip they were trying to clone and fed it challenges, and then tried to duplicate the response by testing all 1,099,511,627,776 possible encryption keys.
Once they had the right key, they could answer future challenges correctly.
Mr. Sabetti of Texas Instruments argues that grabbing the code from a key would be very difficult, because the chips have a very short broadcast range.
The greatest distance that his company's engineers have managed in the laboratory is 12 inches, and then only with large antennas that require a power source.

The Texas Instruments chips are also used in millions of the Speedpass tags that drivers use to buy gasoline at ExxonMobil stations without pulling out a credit card, and the researchers have shown that they can buy gas with a cracked code.

Dr. Wagner said that what graduate students could do, organized crime could also do.
"The white hats don't have a monopoly on cryptographic expertise," he said.
Dr. Rubin said that if criminals did eventually duplicate his students' work, people could block eavesdroppers by keeping the key or Speedpass token in a tinfoil sheath when not in use.

With higher rates, P/E valuations will look a little more costly, and the attractiveness of stocks under the Fed model will decline.
In fact, one reason that stocks seem cheaper now under the Fed model than they did at the end of 2004 is that the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note has fallen.

Several indicators suggest that the demand for stocks is waning.
The number of stocks hitting new highs has fallen, while the number hitting new lows has climbed.
The flagging of investor demand shows up in the flow of money in and out of equity mutual funds.
January is usually a good month for inflows, but that is not the case this year, according to AMG Data Services.
The big outflow, $4.4 billion, was from funds that invest in American stocks.
While the month is not over -- and flows from some big mutual funds that report monthly are not included -- it is possible that January will register the first negative outflow for domestic stock funds since AMG began gathering data in 1992.
These barometers -- which, really, are no more than the market's bones and tea leaves -- can be good measures of the current climate.

"This is going to be a year where the consumer will not be willing to experiment," Mr. Cohen predicted.
"They'll pay what they want to, for what they want, and go home with their purchases and enjoy them."
Mr. Cohen, citing interviews that NPD conducted after the holidays, said consumers "are still splurging, but with care, and most often, on the so-called aspirational, or accessible, luxury items" -- those that bear a chic brand name but cost less than other chic names.

As it is currently conceived, the route will cut across Garden Valley, within ear- and eyeshot of Heizer's sculpture and the ranch right next to it where he lives, a kind of survivalist compound of cinder block and solar panels, an oasis of cottonwoods and wild plum trees in the middle of a wide, empty plain.
Having moved long ago to this virtual end of the earth, and having also moved heaven and earth to build in isolation his immense sculpture, Heizer now finds the federal government is plotting, as he sees things, to ruin it and him.
Heizer knows it's highly unlikely that he or anyone else will suddenly stop Yucca cold, but he says he's hoping at least to persuade Department of Energy officials at this 11th hour to redirect the tracks next door through Coal Valley and Murphy Gap.
Of course he is deeply pessimistic.
"I've always been a pessimist," he tells me, "but now I think things are going to get really, really bad."
Squinting into a fresh plume of cigar smoke, which rises like a dark cloud around him, he starts imagining first the rail, then wells, then electric power lines invading the valley, while "sniveling toady" politicians, as he calls them, do nothing.
His soliloquy crescendos, linking defense contractors like Kellogg Brown & Root and Bechtel to the government as a sinister cabal machinating against him -- "I wouldn't be surprised if they sent out a hit squad to kill me!"
-- when the silence of Murphy Gap is suddenly shattered by a heart-stopping boom.

At 60, with hawkish steel gray eyes, a kind of wary stare, a deeply lined face and haphazardly combed-over hair, Heizer is still gaunt from a decade-long battle with a neurological disorder that left him weak and in crippling pain.
The knowledge that the government or his body or both could prove his work's undoing makes him more fierce at the same time that he seems swallowed up in his clothes: dusty khakis, a checked vest over a plaid shirt, a sheepskin hat with earflaps and cowboy boots.
He affects the look of other ranchers in this hardscrabble stretch of range, a resemblance that partly belies his upbringing.
Born in Berkeley, Calif., Heizer comes from an accomplished family of academics, geologists and miners with some history in Nevada, a history that he's proud of and that explains how he ended up making art here.
In the early 60's, Claes Oldenburg, Carl Andre and Walter De Maria were digging holes or talking about digging holes, making performances out of the process.
De Maria was imagining milelong parallel walls in the desert, and Robert Smithson was mapping the New Jersey landscape, visiting quarries, making "Nonsites" out of rocks he collected and conceptualizing Earth Art, which became a catchall term for disparate experiments.
It was an era of chest-thumping, clashing personalities, proclaiming to remake art from scratch, and Heizer fitted right in.
Negative sculpture, as Heizer called art made out of the space left behind from digging, crept into the mainstream consciousness, even if many people have never heard of him.
Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the memorial design for ground zero are both riffs, in part, on Heizer's negative vocabulary.

Adventuresome patrons and dealers like Robert Scull, Heiner Friedrich, Richard Bellamy, Virginia Dwan and Sam Wagstaff gravitated to the moody Westerner with the Ayn Rand vision and smoldering charm.
But awe, even fear, was sometimes part of the work: the fear a viewer might feel about falling into one of the deeper holes.

His best-known work was "Double Negative," for which he cut a 1,500-foot-long, 50-foot-deep, 30-foot-wide gash onto facing slopes of the Mormon Mesa in Nevada by blasting and scraping away 240,000 tons of rock.
Smithson, as Heizer sees it, "just copied my M.O., did a complete heavy borrowing, an identity theft."
Over the years, most of Heizer's friendships with artists he knew then have fallen away.
It was to be experienced over time, in shifting weather, not from a single vantage point or from above but as an accumulation of impressions and views gathered by slowly walking through it.
Artists in the 1960's and 70's -- Donald Judd, Andre, De Maria, Smithson, others -- were pushing sculpture off its pedestal.
Artists have always had assistants.

"City," in its vastness, was meant to synthesize ancient monuments, Minimalism and industrial technology.
Heizer resists such strict comparisons, stressing his basic abstract impulses.
"The trouble is," he explained to me, "once you say something about a source, then you've pegged it down, and so now I'm reluctant to say anything.
If I say I developed 50 different shapes from Mississippian tumuli, that doesn't mean they're copies of tumuli -- I'm not ripping off those shapes.
I said I derived some of the shapes from the serpent motif at Chichén Itzá, and now I have to live with this forever, as if that's the whole meaning behind it."
That might mean Eskimos or Peruvians.
Whatever its sources, in its ambition and idiosyncrasy, it is clearly a very eccentric, American vision.

During the mid-1950's, the National Academy of Sciences raised the question of what should be done with the country's radioactive military waste.
"Part of my art," Heizer explained when he picked Garden Valley, "is based on an awareness that we live in a nuclear era.
We're probably living at the end of civilization."
At the same time, it was inspired, Heizer said, by what he calls the ceremonial city: "Every old city has the same sort of ceremonial feature, whether it's the Tuileries or St. Peter's or Teotihuacán.
The long, stretched-out format of my sculpture is in dialogue with this ancient way of formatting space."

Heizer also designed "City" to blend into the contours of the valley and to act as a kind of bunker or container, open to the sky but dug into the earth, low to the ground (he admires Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings) and, as much as possible, disguised from outside, so that the natural vista would be largely preserved.

The military metaphor of the bunker, with its defensive aura, is hard to miss.
Years ago, Heizer compared the first part of "City" -- a sloped, flat-topped mound with projecting beams that he called Complex One -- to a blast shield.
He has since constructed pits and perimeter mounds, turning his work into a sort of airy, roaming fortress made of millions of yards of dirt, so many yards by now that he long ago lost count.
"It is connected to the environment but not to the landscape.
Landscape to me is a planar thing, just a view.
Environment is everything down to the ecosystem.
Big difference."
Ten years after Heizer conceived "City," Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which insisted that the Department of Energy find deep geological disposal sites -- and also that the United States must permanently dispose of spent fuel from nuclear reactors, not reuse it, which meant that there would be less dangerous plutonium floating around in the world, but more waste to dispose of.

By then, Heizer had reached an impasse on "City."
He finished Complex One in 1974, mostly working by himself, using a paddle-wheel scraper a farmer lent him and following plans drawn up by seismic engineers; then he started on Complexes Two and Three, gargantuan mounds that proved to be vastly more troublesome.
"I never stopped working on the pit and the Complexes, whenever I could afford to.
But we're talking crazy optimism here."
In 1995, he mistook pain in his fingers and toes for frostbite because he had been standing in the cold 12 hours a day working on his sculpture.
"I thought I was eternal," Heizer told me one evening, relaxing after dinner in his living room, flexing his hands while staring absently at the Science Channel.
"I still do.
For a while he couldn't walk, then he had to use crutches.
If he'd never gotten to those, he would still have accomplished a feat on a scale not unlike, say, Mount Rushmore, which, along with the cowboy paintings of Charles Russell and Frederic Remington, is just about the only American art Heizer now volunteers to praise.
Two Remington cowboy sculptures are on either end of the long table in his living room, and he keeps handy an old book of Russell's paintings of the West.
"I love these artists because they're so precise and faithful," he says.
I couldn't decipher the work at first, save for a few distinctive shapes.
The additions now dwarf the first phase of the project, making

Complexes One, Two and Three, which are collectively nearly the size of Yankee Stadium, look tiny and precious.
The new phases are more pneumatic -- raked dirt formations resembling hills, valleys and mountains.
There is a patch of unspoiled sage, like a park, smack in the middle, for flood runoff through the valley (Heizer was thrilled to discover that it actually worked during the recent January storms); and there's now a concrete sculpture, "45ö, 90ö, 180ö," which both evokes ancient Egypt and resembles a board game on the scale of an airport hangar.
"I call it a defracted gestalt," Heizer said while slowly steering the truck to the steep precipice of what he calls Alpha mound.
"From the ground you grasp the size but can't make out the shapes -- the opposite of what you sense from the air -- and your perception changes as you move around."
Heizer occasionally refers to the valley as virgin land; he obsesses about the originality of his conception, about protecting his property and his art from violation by the rail, from developers hunting for underground water, from people trying to sneak in to see the sculpture before it's finished.
His project is propelled by anger and resentment and monomania but also by Eros: sculpture as voluptuous, unspoiled and ecstatic, an organic body (one mound from the air, I saw, clearly resembles an erect phallus).

The question, at a time when there's so little talk about government financing for new art of any sort, is whether a country that claims to prize its rugged individualists and its native treasures, both natural and cultural, will care enough to try to avoid "City" by running the nuclear train elsewhere -- whether accommodations will be made simply to preserve a sculpture and the equally obscure, awesome valley it occupies.

Obscure, in the art's case, not just because it's physically remote, but also because Heizer has frightened away almost everyone from seeing "City."
He's the opposite of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, whose "Gates," to be unveiled this week in Central Park in New York -- another gigantic sculpture project decades in the making -- is ephemeral.
Christo and Jeanne-Claude regard the public spectacle of their installation as part of the work itself: the art is a kind of temporary performance.
Only when "City" is finished -- Heizer predicts it could take another decade to complete the 15 miles of concrete curbs that delineate the mounds and shore up the dirt slopes -- will the public be invited.
Meanwhile, as he kept insisting to me while we were bumping down what sufficed for the path through Murphy Gap, anyone trying to show up uninvited will be arrested for trespassing or shot at.
Then I heard gunshots.
It's a message, he speculated.
Like him, he said, they just want to be left alone.

Heizer's ranch is a three-hour drive north of two million people in Las Vegas, but it's an hour's drive from almost anyone.
His driveway is an unmarked dirt road meandering across several empty valleys and mountain ranges, more than an hour from blacktop.
He rarely leaves the ranch these days, and hardly anyone visits except the construction crew.
Heizer's Garden Valley is in Lincoln County, which, like half of Nevada, is a place where ranchers run cattle up-country during the spring and summer, down-country during the winter.
This is mountainous range.
Gold miners used to prospect here; there is still mining for opal and vermiculite.
They're raising beefalo.
They also grow alfalfa.
Their house is simple, comfortable, a low two-story building with a big kitchen in front.
There's a metal shop, a dog kennel, a bunkhouse for workers to sleep in overnight, pens for cattle and farming equipment scattered along with half-finished sculptures in the yard.

Mary, although she's from Michigan, is a Western classic, soft-spoken and steady.
She can birth a calf, make plum jam, change a truck tire, help oversee the complicated accounting on the project, ride herd over construction workers and ranch hands, format the digital images of the sculpture on the computer, reprogram electronics for the testy solar panels and in her spare time retreat to a studio behind Heizer's office and paint abstract pictures of an ethereal calm and Western light.
She's in charge of the herd.
The plan is to keep expanding it, she said.
She and Heizer live pretty much like many small-time ranchers in their elective isolation.
He's just the only guy around building the equivalent of the ancient pyramids in his front yard.
Lincoln County is Mormon country, where ranching families go back to the 1800's, people don't like the government telling them what to do and outsiders are regarded with suspicion.
One evening I discovered Mary and Heizer laughing in the living room.
The dozen or so men who now work with him -- several of whom trek hundreds of miles each week across the desert to accommodate Heizer's sudden decisions to shift several hundred thousand yards of dirt a few inches this way or that -- profess deep affection.
He's a perfectionist; they shrug.

If Heizer, over the years, picked fights and lost allies, insisting, against common sense, he was the first, the only, the best artist around, clearly some people have stuck loyally by him.
"The people who really spend time with him love him," says Michael Govan, who, along with Lynne Cooke, Dia's longtime curator, visits maybe three or four times a year to check on the sculpture's progress.
"Never a nickel gets spent on anything that's not necessary," Govan adds.
"If Mike weren't managing the construction and we had used outside contractors, it would have cost double, I'm sure.
He's honorable."

The patrons Govan has enlisted -- the Lannan Foundation, the Riggio family and the Brown Foundation, the same Browns, by the way, of the defense contractor Kellogg Brown, which Heizer said was scheming to bump him off -- have stuck with a project that could cost nearly $25 million by the end.
"Mike does things how he wants," says J. Patrick Lannan Jr., the foundation's president.
"But it's going to be a monumental gift to culture for generations to come."
Even Heizer is astonished: "I told them they're playing with fire.
I'm an artist.
I don't work with drawings or models.
This is a creative process.
It's an act of faith on their part."
Later he dug up a passage from the book and e-mailed it to me:

"During all these months the Pope kept insisting that Michelangelo complete his ceiling quickly, quickly!
'When will it be finished?'
" 'When I have satisfied myself.'
" 'Satisfied yourself in what?
You have already taken four full years.'

" 'In the matter of art, Holy Father.'
" 'It is my pleasure that you finish it in a matter of days.'
" 'It will be done, Holy Father, when it will be done.'
"

Heizer figures that when his own work is done, it will be there for anybody to see for centuries -- that he's building not for today but for the ages.
It's a perspective he came by naturally.

Preserved in a file cabinet in Heizer's office is a page from The San Francisco Chronicle, dated Dec. 17, 1941.
It's a picture of a slender, youngish Robert holding a box of 350-year-old rusty iron spikes that bound the oaken ribs of a sunken Spanish explorer ship.
A 1946 newspaper cartoon of Robert is tucked in the same folder.
He's depicted as a bespectacled Indiana Jones in tie and tweed jacket, brandishing a skull before a pile of bones.
Some of the mounds in "City," it occurs to me when I see the cartoon, are shaped like bones, and the stelae are a bit like the spikes.

In front of Heizer's house there is also a gigantic perforated sculpture resembling Swiss cheese.
Heizers have been in or around Nevada since the 1880's.
(A family story, Heizer says, is that one of Olaf's horses was used by Eadweard Muybridge for his stop-action photographs.)
My father admitted to me later that he'd thought I would come to no good.
He supported himself working for slumlords, lugging a compressor over the cobblestone streets in SoHo, hooking up a spray gun and painting a six-story building top to bottom (white in the rooms, brown in the stairwells) in a day.
"I met Walter De Maria painting his loft.
These served almost as diagrams for the sculptures he would make in the earth.
Much of that first outdoor work was fleeting, almost provisional, the opposite of "City."
He has changed over the years, as a result of defending himself from attacks, real or imagined.
"When I visited at first Mike was living in a trailer and had a big young Mormon working for him," Dwan recalls.

Eventually he built himself a house out of cinder-block seconds.
"There he is in the middle of nowhere, without an art world to talk to, without a bar where he can go find friends for support, building something much larger than anyone has ever built, knowing he is going to be criticized for grandiosity, and yet going ahead and building what he must.
That takes courage."
Heizer still commuted to New York and Los Angeles, doing commissions, networking.
"They're frivolous, I'm not," he told me.
"You don't control your own destiny in New York.
It's fine if you trust the system and agree to move along the street in an orderly fashion.
But you can't carry a weapon to protect yourself, even though it's more dangerous there than here.
I find it castrating."
And when you look at the old photographs of us, you can see the joy in our faces."

That was then.
Should the rail go through, Heizer now claims, he'll dynamite "City," never mind that he is building it to be indestructible for thousands of years, or that the people giving him money aren't likely to fork over another million or so dollars to destroy it and return the desert to its original condition.
But with him, it has become all or nothing.
Posterity isn't the next generation; it's a millennium.
"Double Negative" was "the most incredible sculpture I've ever seen or done," Heizer says.
I knew I'd done it.

And he did not just add his sensibility to radical art movements of the 60's and 70's.
As he sees it, he single-handedly, without influence from any other living artist, started a "revolution."
"I'm self-entertaining," he declares in another fervid soliloquy.
"My dialogue is with myself."
The sculptor Richard Serra, Heizer's contemporary, who was an acquaintance of Heizer's during the 60's and whose own work sometimes now rivals Heizer's in size, has said: "Whoever tells you he dropped from heaven knows the opposite is equally true."
Serra hasn't seen "City," but he told me that he could imagine "the work may empower people in ways that don't have to do with scale, in ways that we can't foresee.
Heizer's stance is empowering because what artists do is individuate themselves, and this guy has done it to the nth degree."
Of course, Heizer is not really on his own in the desert, as the nuclear train proves.
We were in his kitchen with Gracian Uhalde, his nearest neighbor, who has a ranch about 15 miles away and who works as a contractor on "City."
We sat before cups of strong espresso that Heizer likes to serve in glass tumblers at the table his father built for him years ago out of mining timbers scavenged from some abandoned mine shafts in the Golden Gate Range.
The MX plan was to crisscross Garden and other nearby valleys -- Coal, Dry Lake, Delamar -- with rail tracks leading to silos for moving around and hiding missiles.
"Now they're back at it."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When I found Uhalde working at "City" later that same morning, he moseyed over, stomping his feet against the bitter cold, and slid a pinch of chewing tobacco into his cheek.
In his early 50's, he has a broad, well-creased face, partly hidden behind a huge white handlebar mustache.
Heizer calls him a cowboy, a small-time rancher, which to Heizer is a big compliment.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

"People are here because we want to be here, because we're attached to this place," Uhalde said.
"You don't come to Lincoln County to make it in the world."
Like Heizer, he has become outspoken against the Yucca rail plan, which he fears will destroy his cattle's grazing land.
Uhalde went on: "Now we have about 10,000 acres altogether, between the ranch here and one up north, and we farm about 150 acres for hay and have a couple thousand sheep plus 600 cows.
We've been around for 100 years.
Uhalde had been carrying it around lately.
It showed cartoons of bowlegged cowboys on the range, watching mushroom clouds rise over the mountains.
Allowing that "fallout can be inconvenient," it provides helpful tips like opening windows to avoid shock waves, wearing sunglasses if staring at fireballs and brushing off clothing when covered with radioactive dust.
Deer started showing up with burn patches.
We would try to figure out where the pink clouds were heading.
"Then in the late 80's my sister started having symptoms.
Around then I got a tumor growing in my bladder.
We both applied for downwinders' compensation.
"Now we say, just leave us alone and take your nuclear glow train through some other valley, along the highway or whatever.
Just not here.
Here you've got ranching -- small-time, old-style ranching, with the valley as a natural, reusable resource -- coexisting in peace with Mike's project, a cultural monument.
The rail will kill all that."
"The train is just part of the problem," he said.
"Developers want to rape this place."
Railroad Valley, just next to Garden Valley, has oil wells and a refinery in it, Uhalde added.
Is there oil in this valley?
"God, I hope not," he said.
The Bureau of Land Management, which controls public lands, meaning most of Garden Valley, issued what's called a temporary segregation to reserve the rail route.
Next will come an Environmental Impact Statement.
The department plans to issue a draft of what it calls the "Rail Alignment Environmental Impact Statement" by late spring or early summer.
After that come hearings and another chance for public response before the final E.I.S.
is issued and the fate of the rail line is decided sometime early in fiscal year 2006, Davis said.

"We have several laws to comply with," Gene Kolkman added.
He is field manager for the B.L.M.
in nearby Ely and oversees land withdrawal.
If the rail line intersects free roaming area for wild horses, that will require modifications because the horses are protected by the Wild Horse and Burro Act.
Ranchers must be compensated if the rail cuts off grazing lands and harms their livelihood.
"It's very seldom that a project comes in, especially a controversial project like the Yucca Mountain railroad line, and that it ends up being authorized as it was originally configured," Kolkman said.
A former Energy Department consultant on Yucca who is rooting for Heizer's plan to move the route to another valley (and so who asked not to be identified by name) nonetheless defended the selection of Yucca.
No site is perfect, he said.
But he acknowledged the problem of shipping the waste to Yucca.
Spent fuel contains heavy metals, and they aren't called heavy for nothing.
They require massive rail containers for transport.
Cement for constructing the storage site must also be carried to it, tons of cement, on the scale of Hoover Dam.
This is to be one of the largest public work projects ever.
The shortest route would skirt Las Vegas, but the more politically feasible path -- and the one mapped by the Department of Energy -- goes from Caliente through the middle of nowhere, which is to say, right through Michael Heizer's front yard.
Politics has trumped art, the consultant said, at least for the moment.
"Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel," the 1939 classic by Virginia Lee Burton, is about Mike Mulligan and his red steam shovel, Mary Anne.
They quit the big city, frustrated because steam shovels were succeeded by electric and diesel shovels, and they find work in the countryside.
In faraway Popperville, they dig a cellar for a new town hall but, in their haste, they forget to leave a way out.
They end up entombed in the cellar, Mike as the janitor, Mary Anne as the furnace.
Heizer says he loved the story so much as a boy that his mother used to call him Mike Mulligan.
Hicks has the chapped lips and weathered face of a cowboy who has spent his life in the great Western outdoors.
He has been working on "City" for years.
He told me he makes the daily commute across the mountains and the desert from Ely, two hours each way, to work 10-hour shifts on this project.
"I can't sleep anyway, so why not drive?"
he said, laughing.
Like the other men, he enjoys working for Heizer.

"I've worked on an airport runway and on highways," he said, "where you've got big crews; the bosses flood the projects with equipment, nothing's complicated, you know beforehand the shape and the curve or whatever.
This is completely different, 180 degrees."
How so?
He nodded toward Beta Mound, an immense, quarter-mile-long construction of dirt with sloping sides, a flat top and a rounded nose.
Maybe you wouldn't notice, but somebody will.
And that will last hundreds of years."

When I came across Bill Harmon, who pours concrete for the curbs, he echoed what Hicks said about discovering, in the process of building "City," an American can-do ideal, the fine art of heavy construction.
Harmon is from Ruby Valley, 230 miles north, and during the week he lives in a trailer at Uhalde's ranch across the valley with six other guys working on the project, including his two sons, Clint and Bo.

"Mike is demanding," he said.
"But that's why things are as good as they are.
I've worked in concrete all my life, and I've never had the time or money to do something to the best of my ability.
Everything is hurry up.
It's about making money.
That's the American way.
But here we have to produce something that has more to do with accuracy than I've ever been allowed even to imagine.
This here is my chance to do the best I can.
I travel over 400 miles a week just to be here.
And my boys take pride in it, too.
When it's finished, I'll be able to say, I had the chance to do that."
I asked him what he thinks the sculpture is about.
"It's hard to explain," he added.
I could not see why we were doing this.
Were we going to live in it?

"But gradually I got the idea.
I can't say exactly what it means now, but I know it has to do with history and with making something that will last.
I'm not an artist, but I can tell you I'm real proud to be working on something like this."
"It takes a while to get used to how Mike does things.
But we admire him because he's not afraid to be different.
And we're glad for him.
It's not too many people in life get to see their dream come true, is it?"
Roaming antelope and coyote hunting for rabbits had made the dogs bark at night.
So much of Heizer's hubris is bravado, I think -- his not having enough people around to vent to, to talk back to him.
And in the end the work, which possesses him and drives him and other people crazy, is the only thing that will count -- if it isn't spoiled by the nuclear rail line or if Heizer doesn't blow it up first.
"They're crap," he said.
"They'll blow out if you hit a big rock, and then you'll be stuck."
With that, I drove off, tires crunching in the cold gravel, as the first rays of sun hit the snow on the mountains, casting the valley in a pearly gray pool of winter light.

While the decline was modest -- to 3.98 percent from 4.02 percent on Tuesday -- the move below the symbolic level of 4 percent highlighted the peculiar nature of the recent rally in Treasury securities: long-term interest rates have been held down even as the Federal Reserve has steadily pushed short-term rates up.

Since the start of the trial, the defense lawyers have been working to cast him as untrustworthy, despite Judge Johnson's ruling limiting their attacks.
A ruling from the judge kept Mr. Murphy from answering.
Mr. Jacobs asked Mr. Murphy how much Mr. Alanssi had shaped the recorded conversations by trying to steer the sheik toward damaging statements.

But a growing number of Republicans, anxious about plans to partially privatize Social Security, are now pushing Mr. Bush to combine that goal with tax overhaul.

"We can deal with Social Security and taxes simultaneously," said Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, in a speech last month.
"Sometimes, the more you include in a piece of legislation, the easier it is to pass."
The potential advantage of marrying the two agendas, many lawmakers say, is to win maneuvering room to write legislation that would appeal to Democrats and have a chance of becoming law.
But the risk could be a huge political logjam.
Mr. Bush's plan for Social Security could be bogged down for years if it became stuck in a lobbying battle between tax-reform winners and losers.
"I would not want to see us deflect attention" from Social Security, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said at a recent Congressional hearing.

Many House Republicans have been pushing for a fundamental tax overhaul.
Lawmakers have introduced numerous bills over the last year that would replace today's system of progressive tax rates with a flat income tax or a national sales tax.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Other Republicans, including many of Mr. Bush's advisers, would seek the same goal but from the opposite direction.
Instead of taxing sales, the government would embark on a series of seemingly incremental changes that eliminated taxes on savings and investment income.
Eventually, people would be taxed only on what they spend.

Mr. Bush has signaled strongly that he does not favor the most radical solutions that some Republicans have advocated for years.
The deduction for mortgage interest, for example, would be meaningless in a system based on a national sales tax.
The mortgage tax break, which costs the Treasury about $72 billion a year, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, would also undermine a basic goal of a flat income tax: to offer a lower tax rate in exchange for eliminating traditional tax breaks.
On top of that, Mr. Bush has asked the panel to prevent a huge expansion of the so-called alternative minimum tax -- a tax that was originally aimed at the nation's wealthiest households but is now engulfing millions of additional families as incomes rise with inflation each year.

Freezing the alternative minimum tax would cost the government about $500 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

"It's going to be a difficult assignment," said John B. Breaux, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana who is co-chairman of Mr. Bush's tax advisory panel.
The group meets for the first time on Wednesday.
"There's a pretty strong consensus that we want to do something about the alternative minimum tax.
But any time we look to eliminate a feature of the code that raises revenues, we'll have to find something else to raise revenues that replaces it."
"It will make things harder," he said.

The basic political problem is in balancing the winners and losers in any comprehensive tax code change.
"It's a lot easier to get something through Congress when all you're saying is 'Let's cut taxes,"' said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research organization based in Dallas.
"But when you are talking about a reform agenda, that implies trade-offs.
And we haven't seen them do that."

Simplifying the tax code would pose difficult choices about some popular tax breaks, including several that President Bush expanded during his first term.
In addition to the mortgage interest deduction, other breaks that might be considered include these:

The exclusion from capital gains of up to $500,000 from profits on home sales, which will cost $23 billion this year.

In many respects, the challenges today are more daunting than those that faced President Ronald Reagan when he led a bipartisan tax overhaul in 1986.
That change lowered the top tax rates and created a much flatter rate structure, paying for lower rates by eliminating scores of special tax breaks.

Both a flat tax and a consumption tax would probably shift more of the tax burden from high-income households to middle- and lower-income taxpayers.
That is because the top 10 percent of income earners, those who earn more than roughly $100,000 a year, currently pay about 65 percent of all federal income taxes.
One-third of all American households pay no federal income tax at all.

In 1996, the Treasury Department estimated that the nation would need a flat income tax of 20.8 percent to fully replace the progressive rates of the income tax for individuals and the corporate income tax.
If a flat tax were imposed, tax exemptions for middle- and lower-income families could protect many from automatic tax increases, but analysts say it would be very difficult to prevent some of the tax burden from shifting from the wealthiest households to those with more moderate incomes.
"Systematic reform usually makes those losers more identifiable up front."
"There's still a lot of legwork to be done" on taxes, Mr. Bush said at a news conference two days after the election.
But Republicans who are pushing for a tax code overhaul, including many House lawmakers and many of Mr. Bush's advisers, have argued for years that the system should tax consumption rather than income.
One reason, they contend, is that the current system taxes people who save and invest their income as much as it does people who spend everything they have.

But White House officials are playing for time.

The payroll tax brings in almost as much revenue as the income tax, but it has been widely criticized as regressive, because it is not imposed on annual income of more than $90,000 a year.
Because employers pay half of the 12.4 percent payroll tax, critics say the payroll tax also discourages hiring.
In recent weeks, numerous Republican lawmakers and Mr. Breaux have echoed Mr. Thomas's call to broaden the Social Security debate and link it with tax reform.

On a drab block of 43rd Street west of Eighth Avenue, Steven C. Witkoff, a real estate investor, bought a garage, a four-story hotel and a third building, where he plans to build a condominium apartment tower.

And now, in large part to compete with the football stadium it is trying to defeat, Cablevision has offered to pay $600 million for the rights to the railroad yard and the construction of a platform above, all to build a complex of housing and office buildings.

"I think the momentum has begun and there'll be an uptick from this point forward," said Harvey Shulweiss, who has owned a large development site at the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 33rd Street since the 1980's.
"The Far West Side is going to be a hotbed of development."

Much of the current interest in the Far West Side is fueled by the seemingly insatiable thirst for housing at any price and the Bloomberg administration's rezoning of the 42-block area for large projects.
The Real Estate Board of New York reports a record-setting number of condominium and cooperatives sold in Manhattan, 3,145 in the third quarter of 2004, more than at any time in the last four years.
And the average sales price of a condominium in Manhattan has soared past $1.2 million, according to the Corcoran Group, a real estate company.
Developers say that interest rates remain low and it is still very easy to finance condominium projects.
"The Far West Side of Midtown is in all probability the last neighborhood in Manhattan with enough critical mass," said Jules Demchick, who is building a 46-story apartment tower on 42nd Street near 12th Avenue.
"It has huge potential because you have the ability to assemble large pieces of land."

The suddenly hot market is the backdrop for the current uproar over the sale of development rights at the railyards by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

"The whole process has drawn attention to the long term value of the public land," said Lynn Sagalyn, a professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania.
"The Cablevision bid has opened up the question of what's the proper price and procedure for capturing the public value."

In comparison to the Cablevision offer, the Jets had offered $100 million, with the city and the state splitting the estimated $375 million cost of a deck.
The M.T.A.
Since the Jets were using about one-third of the estimated development rights, the M.T.A.
asked for $300 million.
But transportation advocates and stadium opponents have claimed that the M.T.A.
should be asking for full value, given that it is contemplating service cuts, fare hikes and a multibillion-dollar gap in its capital budget.
Peter S. Kalikow, the authority's chairman, has said that his board will review the Cablevision offer, while continuing its year-long negotiations with the Jets.

Although the city, the Jets and the Real Estate Board have assailed Cablevision's offer as a spoiler and a public relations event, company executives seem to think they cannot lose, because their offer is still below the value of the yards.
But developers view the Far West Side far differently today than when Mr. Doctoroff began his Olympic campaign.

"It's clearly valuable," said a major residential developer, who asked not to be identified.
"But can anyone in my position say so on the record?
Everyone, including me, is scared to cross him on this.
I've got too many things cooking in this town" that require city approval.
Mr. Shulweiss is ambivalent about the stadium.
"It was the zoning clarification on the far West Side."

"The existence of the stadium," he added, "might accelerate the development of the subway and other infrastructure that would enhance the value of everyone's property."
The state and the city embarked on a plan in 1984 to transform a 13-block area--the same size as the railyards--into neon-infused entertainment and commercial area.
They estimated that it would cost about $40 million to acquire the 42nd Street block between Broadway and Eighth Avenue.
With the lawsuits failing in May 1989, the Dursts threw up another roadblock, buying the leases to the eight historic theaters on 42nd Street that the state's project was intending to revive.

"The volatile story of 42nd Street should make people cautious about land values in a rapidly changing real estate market," said Ms. Sagalyn, author of "Times Square Roulette; Remaking the City Icon."
"Long-term projects have a way of taking unexpected twists and turns."
The implication was that Fed officials, far from being ready to pause in their rate increases, might feel even more need to keep going.

Since last June, the Fed has raised the overnight rate in a series of quarter-point increases to 2.5 percent, from 1 percent.
And credit spreads -- the additional risk premiums that financial institutions demand from riskier borrowers -- have narrowed as well.
Fed surveys of bank lending officers indicate that banks have eased their standards on business loans.
"This development contrasts with most experience," Mr. Greenspan said on Wednesday in his semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
"It will be some time before we are able to better judge the forces underlying recent experience."

One standard theory is that bond investors expect an economic slowdown, which would reduce the demand for money in the future.
But Mr. Greenspan said that explanation "does not mesh" with the rise in stock prices and the narrowing of credit spreads.

A second theory is that foreign central banks were responsible, because they have been buying Treasury bonds and other American securities to keep their currencies cheap in relation to the dollar.

A third explanation is that global investors are simply more confident about the global outlook for inflation and growth than they have been in the past, but there is nothing particularly new in the broader economic outlook to account for a sudden change in behavior.
"For the moment, the broadly unanticipated behavior of world bond markets remains a conundrum," Mr. Greenspan concluded.
