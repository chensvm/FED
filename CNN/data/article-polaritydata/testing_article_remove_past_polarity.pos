Investors hope the Fed's new bias toward higher rates may be the kind of pre-emptive strike that calms fears about inflation, a fear stoked on Friday with the news that the Consumer Price Index jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent in April.
If so, rates may not rise much more.
An interest rate increase soon could also help guide the United States economy to the ''soft landing'' that Fed officials would like.
A soft landing means a slowing of growth here.
But it avoids a sharp decline, or even a recession, which would be much more damaging for emerging-market countries, many of which depend on Americans to buy their exports.
And even if the Fed does raise its short-term interest rate target, economists are not expecting a big move, such as the one that occurred when rates rose three full percentage points in just a year starting in February 1994.
The forecast among many economists and market strategists calls for a total rise of three-quarters of a percentage point in the Federal funds rate between this summer and the first half of next year.
That kind of move, said Jay Pelosky, the global emerging markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, ''is not a sufficient condition for derailing the new investment cycle in the emerging markets.''

Mr. Pelosky also argued that the Fed move is ''good for emerging markets because it will provide a pause or pullback for markets that have risen rapidly.''
Since October, the Morgan Stanley Capital International index of emerging markets has jumped more than 60 percent in dollar terms.
The immediate reaction to big news often deceives investors about the trend for the longer term.
It may also mean that investors are not that concerned about the consequences of any future Fed move.
The Fed also seemed to express confidence in the outlook for emerging markets.
Past comments by Fed policy makers suggest that they would not have taken this step if they thought it would undermine global financial markets.

While a modest move by the Fed would not devastate emerging markets, it would still curb their recoveries.
And even moderately higher interest rates -- a move, say, to more than 6 percent for long-term rates -- would make it harder for nations like Argentina and Venezuela to borrow.
Venezuela is now weighing a major global bond issue.
Plenty of uncertainty remains.
Until it is clear how serious any inflation threat in the United States actually is, speculation about when the Fed will raise rates and by how much will keep emerging markets volatile.
Referring to the Fed's new bias toward higher rates, he said, ''Clearly, it is not good news for emerging markets.''
But, he added, ''we are not expecting the Brazil rebound to be derailed.''
On Tuesday, Fed policy makers said that they were leaning toward raising rates to slow economic growth and curb inflation.
Although they did not actually raise their interest rate target, which is now 4.75 percent, the warning is now official.
''I think it's more confidence in the Fed,'' said Thomas Connor, head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities.
''They've got their eye on the ball here.''
The price of the 30-year bond, which is very sensitive to inflationary expectations, rose 1 2/32, to 92 7/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.80 percent, from 5.88 percent on Tuesday.

The yield on the two-year note was unchanged at 5.43 percent, and the yield on December futures on the Federal funds rate, which is the Fed's target rate, slipped to 5.15 percent from 5.17 percent.
This does not mean that investors think the Fed can avoid raising interest rates to curb inflation.
In fact, the yield on the December futures indicates they expect as much as half-a- percentage-point increase by then.

But if interest rates hold the line, it would show that investors expect the Fed to succeed in curbing inflationary pressures without having to raise interest rates significantly.
Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is forecasting a jump in the Fed funds rate of half a percentage point by the end of the year.
Mr. Berner said bond investors might have been heartened by the recent decline in commodity prices, especially oil.
Some industrial metal prices, including copper, have also declined recently, after strong rallies this spring.
Mr. Berner added that the dollar's new rally against the yen might be a signal that more Japanese investors would resume buying Treasury bonds, which would help alleviate the upward pressure on rates.
But rates are sure to bounce around for a while as new data on growth and prices are released.
Oil prices could turn around again, as some analysts are predicting.
And a revival in global economic growth could send other commodity prices up again.
Any indication that inflationary pressures are increasing will probably push rates higher, as investors speculate on when the central bank will finally pull the trigger.
The Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial watchdog, has begun taking a serious look at the foreign financial community here after having scrutinized the books of Japan's major banks.
The agency has also been investigating some of Credit Suisse First Boston's activities here for the last five months.
It is unclear exactly what the agency has been investigating at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The agency and the firm have declined to comment on the nature of the inquiry.
The supervisory agency has been working hard to establish its credentials as a tough, fair-minded regulator of a financial community that had grown accustomed to lenient treatment from the Ministry of Finance, its former overseer.

Many in the foreign financial community here believe that the Financial Supervisory Agency is looking into whether some firms used transactions involving derivative securities to help clients, including the bankrupt Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, conceal losses.
In the case of Credit Suisse First Boston, the agency also appears to be examining whether the firm's employees sought to impede its investigation by shredding and hiding documents and asking colleagues to withhold information.
Credit Suisse First Boston has suspended with pay its global head of compliance, Anthony Blunden, and Shinji Yamada, head of Credit Suisse Financial Products in Japan, and it has held back bonuses for several other employees in Tokyo, pending the results of its own internal investigation and the agency's inspection.

Some believe Lehman, which has a large derivatives business here, is suspected of similarly aiding Japanese companies and financial institutions in dressing up their income statements and balance sheets.
Foreign financial services firms have been anticipating tougher inspections for some time.
The Financial Supervisory Agency has conducted a sweeping review of Japanese banks and brokerage firms over the last year, so it was only logical to assume the agency would examine foreign firms as well, at least to give the impression of fairness.
After news broke of the agency's investigation into Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment banking arm of the big Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group, American firms went on alert, virtually certain that the agency would not single out a European firm without also aiming at an American one.
In the last few days, bankers said today, Lehman's name had arisen as the likely target, largely because of its extensive operations in derivatives, which are complex securities that derive value from something else, such as stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.
Foreign bankers have reacted to the agency's searches with mild interest partly because they hope the process will provide some clarity to what they regard as substantial gray areas in Japanese regulations.
''Hopefully, this will turn into a learning experience for all of us,'' said an executive at one foreign firm.
On Tuesday, Federal Reserve policy makers said that they were leaning toward raising interest rates to slow economic growth and curb inflation.
Although they did not raise their interest rate target, which is now 4.75 percent, the warning is now official.

Japanese Banks Report Big Losses

Japan's eight largest banks have reported steep fiscal-year losses.
The poor performance largely reflected efforts by the banks to clean their books by writing off bad loans.
The main reason is that the banks must follow stricter rules for evaluating bad loans and creating a deeper cushion of money in the event that good loans go bad.

Now that the world's eighth largest economy has begun to right itself, for example, all the talk about ''global contagion'' seems particularly exaggerated.
Nor was it equivalent to Russia, where the collapse of a Communist state has allowed a mafia to seize control of the economy, or even Mexico, where one corrupt and ossified political party has wielded power for 70 years.

''Wall Street needs a geography lesson,'' Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, a former Cabinet minister who is now president of the Brazilian Association of Exporters, said recently.
''A bank goes bust in Moscow and they sell their Brazilian shares?
They should go back to school.''
Too late for Brazil and its 165 million people, who have had to endure lost jobs and recession since January, stock markets around the world seemed to recognize that error this month.
Other measures of Brazil's strengths are, if anything, more revealing.
In contrast to the traumas that have wracked Russia and the Asian tigers recently, Latin America's largest country has in just 15 years successfully made the transition, without violence or social trauma, from military dictatorship to democracy.
Its democracy is often raucous, as is demonstrated by a current Congressional investigation into insider trading that took place at the time of January's devaluation.
But even though Mr. Cardoso has to work within a system of checks and balances more restrictive than the systems facing his Asian, Russian and Mexican counterparts, he has time and again delivered on promises to restructure the Brazilian state and economy.
After the agreement with the I.M.F.
As political leaders here have noted, none of the countries that have been hectoring Brazil on this matter -- not Germany, not France, not Italy, and certainly not the United States -- have themselves begun to come to grips with the issue at home.
Mr. Cardoso maintained that course, showing unusual political courage, even when a harsh recession set in after the eruption of the Asian crisis in 1997, threatening both his re-election and efforts to stabilize both prices and the real.
The late Carroll Quigley, the Georgetown University professor whom Mr. Clinton has cited as his most influential teacher, used to define capitalism as ''a system of accounting that ignores social costs.''
Judging from Brazil's recent experience, the converse is also true: market-driven philosophies are unwilling to grant credit for social gains that cannot immediately be measured.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

TO Riordan Roett, an expert on the Western Hemisphere at Johns Hopkins University, Mr. Cardoso's most significant achievement may be that during his first term ''more Brazilians were lifted from poverty than in the past 50 years.''
That feat, a result of the same inflation control and currency stabilization program that came under speculative pressure in January, has turned millions of poor Brazilians into consumers and makes the country more attractive to foreign investors hunting for new markets.
''These are extraordinary numbers for so short a period,'' a ''gigantic leap,'' Claudio de Moura Castro, an economist who is the co-author of the study, wrote in the news magazine Veja.
In the long term, of course, they also represent a social investment that will benefit foreign companies in the form of better-educated workers who will, as a consequence, earn higher salaries and be able to spend more money.
A generation ago, Charles de Gaulle visited here and rendered a verdict on Brazilian society so stinging that it is still frequently recalled, always with chagrin.
''This is not a serious country,'' the French leader said.
Brazil in 1999 may still be associated primarily with soccer and samba, but in a perverse way the January crisis was a yardstick of how far the country has come: Thirty-five years ago, even an economic collapse here would have had little impact elsewhere.
Today, for better or worse, Brazil matters.
At a conference in Chicago earlier this month, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, cautioned that Brazil is ''not quite out of the woods,'' a warning that a suddenly euphoric market now seems prepared to discount.
Investors snapped up more than $2 billion in Brazilian bonds issued last month, and so much foreign investment is flowing back into the country that the Government has had to adjust its estimate upward to as high as $20 billion for the year.
Mr. Cardoso himself, however, ever the realist, appears to be as unmoved by the sudden recovery of confidence in Brazil as he was by its January jitters.
So let the market beware.
Cleanup crews have already hauled away 12 million tons of the noxious mud, along with topsoil and dead fish and fowl, and dumped the mess in an unused quarry.
The mine, owned by Boliden Ltd. of Canada, has spent more than $52 million cleaning up, repairing damage and reimbursing farmers for lost crops.
The 20-mile-long flood area looks fairly clean, except for the black mud stains marking walls and bridges.

But a toxic chain has spread through nature that is less visible and may be difficult to break down.
High levels of heavy metals are still embedded in soil and water and have found their way into the wildlife.
Some scientists say it may take years for nature to return the area to normal.
One trouble spot is the nearby Donana reserve and its buffer zone, a kind of European Everglades that is cherished by many nature buffs.
In this mixture of swamps and woodlands, 300 species of birds breed, feed or stop over on their migratory route between Northern Europe and Africa.
Hastily built dikes stopped the toxic flood from entering the reserve, but the contaminated water cut through the buffer zone, and frogs, eels, lizards and insects have fed there.
Those in turn have been eaten by birds like storks, flamingos and ibises.
''It will affect their immune systems and their young.''
The study of the geese is seen as an illustration of the far wider problem throughout the food chain.
''Geese are eaten by eagles and lynxes -- it's a big part of their diet,'' said Miguel Ferrer, a biologist at the Donana reserve.
Because of the contamination, Spain has advised the Scandinavian countries to put a temporary ban on hunting of the geese, many of which fly north for the summer.

But even that may not halt the toxic trail.
Such worrying about the wildlife angers the local farmers, who feel they have a more immediate problem.
They cannot cultivate the once fertile flood plains that used to brim with orchards, rice paddies and cotton and sunflower fields.
Catching fish or river crabs is also forbidden.
Farmers want to know more about the future of their land.

''The most troublesome is the arsenic residue,'' said Mr. Nombela, discussing the most recent soil studies.
''We know very little about how to remove it.''
Biologists are experimenting with chemical treatments and hope to use plants to absorb the contamination, he said.
In the river valley, around the farming town of Aznalcazar, a confrontation is brewing.
The Andalusian regional government has said it wants to turn the affected areas into a 70-mile-long ''green belt,'' plant trees to halt the erosion and create riding and biking trails.
The plan is to cost $160 million, of which Andalusia hopes one-third will be paid by the European Union.
The regional government has just announced that it intends to expropriate 10,000 acres of farmland for its plan, which will affect 400 families.
But the farmers around Aznalcazar said they will fight the plan in court.
''I'm not moving,'' said Mr. Alvarez, whose land is on the expropriation list.
''I'll keep the land fallow as long as it takes.
But I won't give it up.
They're offering less than half the value.''
Carmen Moraira, a local farmer who is coordinating the protests, said the ''green belt plan'' was merely a ploy to get money from the European Union.
''The Government's new love for the environment is phony,'' she said, pointing to piles of garbage on public land.
Eight towns dump their untreated sewage into the Guadiamar River.
''Even as children we could never swim here,'' she said.
Upstream, the zinc mine has just reopened.
But the village of Aznalcazar has lobbied hard to open it.
The village depends on the mine and its 500 jobs.
The judge has made little headway.
To reach a decision, the court needs an independent technical report.
Figures released by the Office of National Statistics showed that British economic growth ground to a halt in the first quarter, the first time that has happened since the second quarter of 1992, the end of the last recession.
The data raised expectations that the Bank of England, which has cut interest rates by 2.25 points, to 5.25 percent, since October, would cut rates further this summer to stimulate growth.

''This correction is largely a function of declining Internet stocks,'' said Laszlo Birinyi of the research firm Birinyi & Associates.

Technology and Internet stocks that trade on Nasdaq suffered most yesterday.
Internet shares have been harder hit.
Since a peak on April 12, the index has lost 30 percent of its value.
It was a bad day to varying degrees in almost every corner of the market.
Paul Cook, lead portfolio manager of the Munder NetNet Fund, which has a little more than $2 billion in assets under management, said profit taking, the threat of higher interest rates and a supply of new issues were putting pressure on stocks.
And since these are high-multiple stocks, they are going to suffer if interest rates move higher.''
Investors facing margin calls in Internet stocks may have been forced to sell Dow stocks to meet them, Mr. Birinyi said.
A spokesman for Charles Schwab, Mo Shafroth, said: ''In the last couple of days, when the Nasdaq takes a dip, it is often the case that there is an increase in margin calls.
I can't quantify how much margin calls are up, but it is more than a little and less than a lot.''

Treasury Prices Rise

By Bloomberg News

Bond prices were little changed yesterday, gaining support from falling stocks, declines in commodities and waning corporate debt demand.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.74 percent from 5.76 percent.
Bonds bounced back as stocks fell in afternoon trading, making less-risky Treasuries attractive.
Waning demand for corporate debt also bolstered the Treasuries' appeal.

To the Editor:

The longest post-World War II recovery with declining unemployment rates and skilled labor shortages is finally benefiting those at the bottom of the economic ladder.
Black male unemployment is declining (front page, May 23), and real wages are finally increasing after almost three decades of stagnation.
What is the response of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to this good news?
Concern over barely discernible inflation and hints that the Fed should raise interest rates.
Tight monetary policy has been a major contributor to employment and wage gaps among the races.
A pre-emptive strike against the possibility of inflation would undermine recent gains by African-American men and lead to a growth in inequality.
MICHAEL ROSEN

Milwaukee, May 24, 1999

The writer is the chairman of the economics department, Milwaukee Area Technical College.
The Brazilian Government and car makers reached an agreement cutting taxes on automobiles as an effort to save jobs in an industry battered by high interest rates.
The accord maintains a previous pact that lowered taxes on small- and medium-sized cars in exchange for pledges from car makers, including General Motors and Fiat, to delay layoffs.
Taxes will remain reduced for 90 days; car makers will suspend job cuts for 120 days.

The Nasdaq index is up 12.67 percent so far this year.
Those indexes have gained 5.9 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, since Dec. 31.
''I always find it a little peculiar when people then try to search for an answer when we're off 5 percent.
The market has been very efficient over the last three to four years at backing off when things got a little too far ahead of themselves.''
Among them is continued uncertainty about the progress of the battles in Yugoslavia, including the possibility of a ground war involving American troops.

The recent declines in the Dow industrials and most other indexes retrace only a portion of recent gains.
After rising in 9 of 10 weeks from the end of February through mid-May, the Dow industrial average has fallen in each of the last three weeks.
Those declines date to the May 13 announcement that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin would resign and include last week's announcement by the Federal Reserve that it might raise interest rates if it continues to see signs of inflation.
The list of Dow stocks that gained the most this spring almost perfectly matches the list of losers in the last three weeks.
Alcoa, for example, rose from $40.50 to $63.875 from Feb. 28 through May 7, a gain of more than 57 percent; in the last three weeks, the shares have fallen back to $55, a 14 percent decline.
Shares of Allied Signal, DuPont and Goodyear Tire and Rubber have followed similar trajectories.
Interest rates, which have generally been climbing since the beginning of the year, have risen more sharply in recent weeks.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell slightly, to 5.82 percent from 5.84 percent on Thursday.
Among the most active stocks on American markets yesterday, Microsoft gained 2 5/16 , to 80 11/16 , making it the single biggest contributor to the day's gain in the S.& P. 500.
Yahoo will take a $68 million pretax charge in the second quarter related to the acquisition.
Paine Webber, which will become part of the S.& P. 500 index after the close of trading next Friday, rose 2 9/16 , to 47.
Paine Webber will replace Bankers Trust, which is being acquired by Deutsche Bank, in the index.
The announcement of its addition to the popular index usually bolsters a company's stock price, as buyers and speculators rush to buy the shares in the hope that more buying will come from large investors who track the index.
Mr. Greenspan's third four-year term as Fed chairman will expire in just over a year.
He has not given any public hint about his plans.
The betting in Washington is that he will choose to stay for another term, that President Clinton will be happy to nominate him and that the Senate will confirm him expeditiously.

But Mr. Greenspan could still prove to be less out of the Cal Ripken mold -- an Iron Man soldiering on, but at risk of playing past his prime -- and more of a Michael Jordan, choosing to retire while on top of his game.
For an economic policy maker, on top might be defined as next year, when the current expansion will become the longest in the nation's history.
IN any case, since Mr. Greenspan's willingness and ability to serve another term are not sure things, speculation has begun about who will be tapped to succeed him, whenever he goes.
Here is a handicapper's guide to likely entries in the race.
(The list would look very different if that moment comes after a new President is elected, especially a Republican President.)
* William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is on nearly everyone's list.
He is the leading candidate from within the Federal Reserve, if only because of the key role the New York Fed plays in monitoring the financial system at home and abroad.
A former banker and diplomat, he played an important part in orchestrating the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management last year and is active in efforts to strengthen global banking standards.
But while he is well known on Wall Street, he is little known in Washington.
And although he votes loyally with Mr. Greenspan on interest rate policy, he has never established a strong public reputation as an inflation fighter.
Early line: 4-1.

* As vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alice M. Rivlin is an obvious candidate, and within the White House the notion of appointing a woman to the post has some appeal.
But while she is a well-respected economist, she is viewed with some suspicion on Wall Street, and she may have diminished her influence within the Fed by spending much of her time helping the District of Columbia clean up its finances.
Early line: 10-1.
* Janet L. Yellen, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, is also seen by Administration insiders as a viable candidate.
A former Fed governor, she has a strong reputation among academic economists as well as Washington experience.
But some analysts question whether she has the leadership qualities a Fed chief needs.
Early line: 15-1.
* Other long shot candidates include Laurence H. Meyer, who was appointed a Fed governor by Mr. Clinton and is the board's most outspoken proponent of orthodox inflation fighting (20-1).
Outside of the Fed, Mr. Clinton could turn to a corps of executives who move between the worlds of Washington and finance.
Among them is Franklin D. Raines, the former White House budget chief, who is now chief executive at Fannie Mae (25-1).
* Of course, Mr. Clinton has two other candidates he can call on in a pinch.
One is Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary and Mr. Clinton's nominee to succeed Mr. Rubin.
A brilliant economist and a forceful personality, Mr. Summers has all the gravitas the Fed job requires and seems to be learning the art of keeping his mouth closed when circumstances dictate, a requirement for any Fed chairman.
Among his fans is Mr. Greenspan, who publicly endorsed his nomination for Treasury Secretary.
Should Mr. Clinton need him more at the Fed than at Treasury, Mr. Summers would be the clear favorite (2-1).
* Then there is Bob Rubin.
The outgoing Treasury Secretary shows no signs of wanting to come back to Washington.
Moreover, he is not an economist and could find the intricacies of monetary policy heavy going.
But his reputation on Wall Street is second only to that of Mr. Greenspan.
.

(A lead-pipe cinch, but only under those unlikely circumstances).
In the meantime, is there a second to that motion for protective custody?
In the process, a new generation of companies is emerging with a different profile than earlier groups.
The newcomers have borrowed the strategy -- favored by Thomson Newspapers and others -- of buying clusters of newspapers in one geographic area, sharing printing and accounting operations and offering big regional advertisers five or six papers in a single buy.
But unlike the established publishing companies, which acquire large and small newspapers in both rural and urban settings, the newcomers have focused exclusively on community newspapers in out-of-the-way regions where the skies are truly dark at night.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Leading the new wave is a company in Birmingham, Ala., called Community Newspaper Holdings Inc., which bought The Times and 44 other newspapers late last year and, in the process, became the biggest little-newspaper company in the country with 95 dailies and 125 weeklies.
What's more, Community Newspaper Holdings is a rarity: its sole investor is a pension fund, which has provided all its working capital.
The Retirement Systems of Alabama, which has $22 billion in assets, has loaned the company $1.13 billion to buy newspapers.
What would a pension fund want with small newspapers, the bottom end of a business that is, in the polite put-down of the financial world, mature?
Small newspapers are suffering from the same problems as their larger brethren: declining circulation and limited growth potential for the ink-on-paper product.
But Community Newspaper and others see gold in the steady if unspectacular cash flow of small businesses that often operate with little or no competition.
There are other incentives.
Think synergy at its most basic.
The director of the Alabama pension fund, David Bronner, wanted a solid return on his investment and a media platform from which to sing the virtues of his adopted state of Alabama.
With Community Newspaper, he gets both.
John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, set up the pension fund manager's calculation like this: ''I can invest in the bond market and earn five or six percent -- or I can invest in all of these teeny cash-flow engines stuck all over the place'' for double that return.
''Even if we have a national recession,'' Mr. Morton added, ''these are pretty durable.''
That durability, however, depends on putting the right combination of newspapers together.
Not all regions fit Community Newspaper's vision.
Ralph J. Martin, the company's top executive, is looking for areas with stable or growing populations, far enough away from large television markets that there are few competitors for local advertising dollars.
He has developed a rough formula.
For long-term economic stability, Mr. Martin said, it helps if a newspaper is near a county seat (lawyers tend to be newspaper readers; governments take out legal advertising); near large educational and medical institutions (educated work force, recession-resistant employers); near large government operations (recession-resistant, stable employers), and near an Interstate highway (truck traffic and tourism keeps communities healthy).
He has selected Community Newspaper's newspapers with an eye to minimizing the effects of an economic downturn.
Mr. Martin, the president and chief executive of Community Newspaper Holdings, said recessions tend to hit the country at large for 18 months to two years; in markets that fit his formula, he said, recessions have lasted eight months or less.
To further reduce risk, he is diversifying.
Community Newspaper's publications are based in a mixed basket of micro-economies in places from northern New York to Kentucky to Texas, reducing the risk that all the revenue streams would dry up simultaneously.

Even so, newspapers are not exactly a traditional investment for a pension fund, but then again, Mr. Bronner is not exactly a traditional pension fund manager.
His investments have also included a Manhattan skyscraper -- 55 Water Street -- a steel mill in Birmingham, chemical plants in Mobile, Ala., a Wal-Mart distribution center in Cullman, and his favorite, a series of golf courses around his adopted state.
''He does a lot of unorthodox things,'' Mr. Stein said.
''He's an entrepreneur in an industry that is dominated by passive investors.''
In 25 years, the assets have grown to $22 billion.
''There is a reason to be out on the cutting edge on some of the things I do,'' Mr. Bronner said.
''But I think about it very hard.''
Investment decisions, he said, are made for financial reasons first, and then are designed to meet one other unique criterion: ''Can I change the image of Alabama?''
The Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail now has 324 holes to play in seven locations around the state.
Which is where the newspapers come in.
In addition to interest rates ranging from 9 to 10.4 percent, the Retirement Systems of Alabama requires, as a condition of its loans to Community Newspaper, that the company's papers provide free advertising space to the pension fund to promote the virtues of Alabama.

One of the company's other partners, Tom Lindley 3d, is a reporter turned editor turned publisher, who is living out old daydreams of running his hometown newspaper.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

On paper, the company's financial goals fit Mr. Lindley's notion of the right balance between profit and investment in journalism.
That is well below the 30 percent-plus margins of some Wall Street favorites, like the Gannett Company.
Editors and publishers may not double as local political leaders and no article may be run unless the subject of the piece has had a fair chance to present his or her side.
Mr. Martin has encouraged the 53 Community Newspaper publications in Oklahoma to create a common statehouse bureau that none could have afforded on its own; the bureau opened four months ago.
There is a question as to whether the state of Alabama, through its pension fund, could have a financial interest in a paper like The Cullman Times without tainting its journalism.
Will Alabama get kid-glove treatment from Community Newspaper?
''No,'' Mr. Bronner said, ''because I know we will drag one foot forward and shoot it off every once in a while.''
All he wants, he said, is to make clear that ''there are some positive aspects along with the negative aspects.''
As described in the current issue of American Journalism Review, the reporters covering the corruption-ridden, economically depressed community balked at Ed Martin's insistence that, when it comes to news, ''good and bad have the same weight.''
Edward C. Dowling Jr., editor and publisher of The Cullman Times, said in a recent interview that a classic newspaper company mistake ''is to think that all markets are the same and can be approached in a cookie-cutter fashion.''
He wants the latitude to earn his community's respect.
Mr. Lindley, who is also editor and publisher of The Evening News in Jeffersonville, Ala., has similar aims.

In fact, Mr. Lindley was the matchmaker between the two key players in Community Newspaper.
One of Mr. Bronner's conditions, on making the initial loan, was that Mr. Lindley would be one of the company's owners.
Mr. Lindley had first-hand experience of what small-town newspapers can go through.
Starting salaries for reporters were $265 a week.
Just a few months before, a feature writer had been living in a homeless shelter.
Then Mr. Martin went looking for more.
For the moment, Mr. Martin said, Community Newspaper is resting on its laurels.
Some future acquisitions and adjustments may be made, but none are on the immediate horizon.
Mr. Lindley now worries about both profit and news, but more about news.
''If we don't do a good job in that regard, then the money will never come,'' he said.
He has hired a city editor and a photographer, neither of which the paper had.
As of now, he said, ''It's not great yet, but it's gotten better.''
The news staff is up from 9 to 11 and starting salaries are up 35 percent, to about $360.
And letters to the editor are pouring in; at the end of last month's mayoral race, Mr. Lindley found the angry incumbent mayor banging on his door on a Saturday night, ''scorched'' in Mr. Lindley's word, by letters he didn't like.

Financial markets in the United States are open today; they were closed yesterday in observance of Memorial Day.
Stocks sold off early yesterday on concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates later this month.
''For the time being, this is a market that is fixated on numbers, not earnings.''
He added, referring to the employment report, due out Friday, ''The wage component of that report will be closely scrutinized by the Fed, and by the market.''
Comments by William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reinforced the impression that policy makers seem increasingly concerned that inflationary pressures are building in the economy.

The rise in interest rates is causing equity strategists and money managers to reposition their portfolios.
It was disclosed yesterday that Jeff Vinik, the former lead portfolio of Fidelity's Magellan fund who now heads his own asset management firm, cut his equity exposure by about $3 billion during the first quarter, selling out positions in Intel, Microsoft and Compaq Computer, among others.
And last week Christine A. Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, announced the first shift in her model portfolio in more than two years by paring her position in stocks.
''We cut our equity exposure because the market is becoming increasingly sensitive to the back-up in interest rates,'' she said yesterday.
''Over the next year, we expect the total return on stocks will lag that of bonds by about seven percentage points.''
Thirty percent of her portfolio is in bonds and 15 percent is in cash.
Financial service stocks, which are acutely sensitive to rising interest rates, were hammered yesterday.
''This is a collection of boxes that people run away from, '' said Elliott Bernerd, the latest person to take on the eyesore as chairman of the South Bank Center.

The complex, occupying one of the most privileged pieces of real estate on earth -- the shoreline of the Thames at a bend that looks across at the Houses of Parliament to the west and St. Paul's Cathedral to the east -- has been a growing visual irritant since it was assembled 30 years ago, when progressive British architects disdained grace and championed guts.
Last year Richard Rogers, the creator of the Pompidou Center in Paris and a noted lecturer on urban London who is a member of the House of Lords and friend of Prime Minister Tony Blair, failed to gain sufficient financing for his plan to sheathe the offending complex in undulating glass.
Struck by the ability of this blot on the London landscape to escape all attempts at face lifts, Rowan Moore, the architecture critic of The Evening Standard, wrote last month: ''The South Bank Arts Center resembles one of those riddling monsters you get in medieval myths, who ask gallant knights deceptively simple questions and then chomp them into powder when they give the wrong answer.''
Mr. Bernerd, 53, the man atop the latest white charger to ride in, is a London-based international property developer, a highly successful self-made man with a reputation for getting things done in ways not always apt to please the sensitivities of esthetes.
But this time it is the resistant concrete bunker of South Bank, not Mr. Bernerd, that is likely to be chomped into powder.
He announced early on that he would not hesitate to bulldoze the offending buildings if necessary.
They held a competition for master planner, narrowed the choice down to a short-list of four architects including Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and Sir Michael Hopkins and then unanimously settled on Rick Mather, an architect with experience in designing buildings for a number of British museums and universities.
His $35 million Neptune Hall has just opened to popular praise at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.
Mr. Mather, a 61-year-old Oregonian with a laconic Pacific Coast manner unaffected by the 36 years he has spent living and working in London, is now charged with coming up with the final plan to recreate the complex, estimated to cost at least $150 million.
The South Bank Center has five buildings, the Jubilee Gardens public green and a parking lot in its 27 acres of river frontage.
The centerpiece is the Royal Festival Hall, built during the 1951 Festival of Britain.
It is as open, inviting and appreciated as the later buildings are off-putting, forbidding and shunned.

In that same year, 1967, the overworked cement mixer produced elevated walkways designed to ease pedestrian passage into the buildings from the street below.
They ended up turning what had once been a lively thoroughfare of small storefronts into a dreary service road and incarcerating the complex in a lumpen girdle of stone.
Probably the most hated single feature of the complex, they are being partially demolished this summer.
In 1975 the Royal National Theater was built next door, and though it is not officially part of the South Bank Center, it is a natural extension of the complex and indistinguishable in the public mind from the rest.
A central premise of any plan that Mr. Mather will be recommending is to take back the cheerless walk along the river from the muggers and muttering solitary types who now lurk in its shadows and turn it into a promenade with cafes, shops and public spaces that will take advantage of the stirring view across the water of illuminated grand hotels, ornate Government ministries and church steeples.
''This needs to feel part of the city again, to be busy and full of life all day,'' said Mr. Mather.
This objective will be aided by two independent ventures now beginning construction, a millennium celebration ferris wheel, said to be the world's largest, at one end of the center's land and a new pedestrian bridge crossing the Thames to replace a current gangway approach alongside the Hungerford railroad bridge that is ankle deep in puddles whenever it rains.
Which in London is to say almost every day.
The experience of approaching South Bank buildings is no happier than the one of departing, leaving visitors with the impression that they are going in furtively by a service entrance or a side door.
Mr. Mather plans to restore a grand marquee that once gave a sense of occasion to entering the Royal Festival Hall and to open up other entranceways to the river.
Plans are already under way to strip away partitions and other additions of the last 40 years that have cluttered its interior expanses.
It was Britain's first public postwar modern building and is the only one in the complex officially covered by a preservation listing.
A study to warm up its sound, long considered too dry and harsh, is to be completed this summer by Larry Kierkegaard, an American acoustics specialist.
Mr. Mather is working from four options, ranging from simple refurbishment to outright demolition and reconstruction of three buildings.
In all the plans, cinema becomes a far greater presence than now, with new quarters planned for the National Film Center, the Museum of the Moving Image and the British Film Institute.
A film school may be created, and a multiplex commercial movie theater will go in nearby.
A circular Imax building has just opened in an adjacent plaza.
So what's different this time from the past visionary projects backed by big names and fed by public yearning ?
One answer is that the end proposal intends to recommend gradual, sequential development rather than a massive one-shot project of the kind of monumentality that has sunk past ventures.
''This time,'' he said with convincing concentration, ''it's going to happen.''
While unexpected, Ms. Rivlin's resignation is unlikely to have a crucial effect on the debate within the Fed on the degree of danger that inflation poses to the nation's long economic expansion.

She has been perhaps the most outspoken proponent at the central bank of the view that the economy is more capable of noninflationary growth than in the past, and more sympathetic than most of her fellow policy makers to the idea that driving the unemployment rate lower under those circumstances is worth the risk of a slight uptick in prices.
''Greenspan has the bulk of the power, given both his position as chairman and his successful stewardship of the Fed up until now,'' said William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
''This doesn't really change things very much.''
And Mr. Greenspan showed every sign of wanting to stay on in the job even after his third term ends next June.

In her resignation letter to Mr. Clinton, Ms. Rivlin said, ''The Fed is a strong bulwark of U.S. economic policy, and I believe we have contributed to keeping the American economy growing and reducing strains in the international financial system.''.

Fed watchers have scrutinized the central bank particularly closely the last several weeks, after its decision on May 18 to tilt policy toward an increase in interest rates.
The first substantial clue could come on Friday, when the Labor Department releases May unemployment data.
In many ways, the Fed's discussions in coming weeks will crystallize a debate that has dominated policy making for the last several years.
To a substantial degree, that debate has revolved around issues central to Ms. Rivlin's view of the economy.
She has made the case that not just factors like higher productivity are tamping down inflation, but that low unemployment -- seen in traditional economic models as a trigger for inflation -- might itself be spurring higher productivity by forcing companies to hold down wage costs through improved efficiency.
''Economists have had in their head the idea that tight labor markets would lead to inflation and low productivity,'' she said in an interview in April with The Financial Times.
''It may be that under the present circumstances of fierce global competition, the effect of tight labor markets is exactly the opposite.''
Ms. Rivlin has also been forthright in her belief that a low unemployment rate -- especially during a period in which Federal, state and local governments are pushing many welfare recipients into the work force for the first time -- is a benefit that should not be given away through blind adherence to old rules about the relationship between inflation, growth and unemployment.
''The models have been predicting higher inflation based on tight labor markets,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis.
The selloffs in stocks since May 18, when the Fed first indicated it was leaning toward a rate increase, have been enough to compensate for higher interest rates, in the view of many investors.

As the Cornerstone Mastercard program of Mellon Bank comes to an end, customers are being freed from a dubious, though superficially attractive, bargain.
The deal, begun by the bank in 1993, was that consumers would get all their interest payments back in a rebate -- after 20 years.
Citicorp, which bought Mellon's credit-card business this year, is ending the program.
Cornerstone customers will get money back much sooner, though not all they have paid.
In October, card holders will get one-twentieth of the interest paid for each year they were in the program, bringing them out roughly even, since the bank will no longer hold their money for the remainder of the planned 20-year term.
Citicorp would not discuss customer reaction to the plan or say how many cards were involved.

Over the course of the NATO bombing campaign against the Serbs, Mrs. Theodosakia, Mrs. McCauley and several of their neighbors in White Plains have been asked regularly to discuss their opinions about the war.
None have relatives or friends in the military.
So without a personal stake in the conflict, they have been paying less attention to what has been happening in Yugoslavia.
They all expressed relief that the Yugoslav leadership appears to have accepted NATO's terms for ending the bombing, but they are skeptical about whether NATO's aims have been accomplished.
Mrs. Theodosakia, who describes herself as a conservative, has come full circle in her views about the war.
At first mistrustful of President Clinton's motives, she came to rally to the NATO cause, believing it a moral mission to save the Kosovo Albanians.
Now, Mrs. Theodosakia, who at age 57 is about to start a new career as a nutritionist, is once again deeply suspicious of the motivations of NATO leaders.
''In every war, there's something behind it -- politics or selfishness on somebody's part -- and yet civilians are the ones who suffer,'' she said.
''I'd really like to know the truth, why they were doing this just in Yugoslavia when there are people suffering all over the world.''

Mr. Clark, a trim 58-year-old, served in Vietnam as a marine and that experience still marks his views.
He looks with a skeptic's eye at any war, no matter how noble sounding its goals, and recalled his own war days as a time when he ''saw kids dying like flies.''
During the more than two months of the Kosovo war, he has had very little patience with what he sees as the bombast of military commanders.
So when NATO missiles began occasionally to go astray, killing Serbian civilians and in some cases Kosovo Albanians, Mr. Clark considered his cynicism well founded.
''There have been so many civilian casualties,'' he said.
Once you go to war, even if you have all these high-tech weapons, as long as you're human, you're going to have errors.''
The only way he could explain his indifference was, again, to reach back to his own memories as a soldier.
''I knew no one would really win.
Been there.
Done that.''
Mrs. McCauley's interest, on the other hand, never flagged.
At 69, she is old enough to remember her father serving in the Army in World War II.
''It was war,'' she said, ''and you never think of anything as being worth war.
But I just don't think Milosevic would have done anything without this war.
He would have just gone on with his ethnic cleansing.''

''It has built in strong expectations of a near-term Fed tightening.''
Referring to the Commerce Department's scheduled release of the Consumer Price Index, Mr. Fine continued, ''Even if next week's C.P.I.
is nonthreatening, the Fed is still likely to tighten on June 30, irrespective of the May C.P.I.
because even a subdued C.P.I.
would have to completely reverse market expectations in order to keep the central bank on hold, which is very unlikely.''

Many market participants are already predicting a quarter-point increase and expect this week's economic reports to provide enough incentive for the 30-year bond to test the 6 percent level, though Mr. Blankman thinks that the final outcome will rest with the midmonth Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
''We believe the Fed will wait for a smoking gun to hike rates,'' Mr. Blankman said.

''It's something you always dream about, playing in the Stanley Cup finals.
We have a lot of 22- and 23-year-olds who have never been there.
Sweaty palms on the way out to the ice.''
Woolley seems to have made a favorable impression on several key Sabres, including Ruff, Captain Mike Peca and defenseman Aleksei Zhitnik, Woolley's power-play partner on the blue line.
''People didn't realize Jason is a good player defensively as well as offensively.
He's slowly earned that respect.
He's a very strong kid.''

Peca, another strong guy, said Woolley ''in the weight room, is one of our strongest guys'' and is someone ''who's never been handed anything.''
Woolley admitted he is ''a little bit uncomfortable'' leading his team in scoring and probably would not have that honor if Miroslav Satan, the high-scoring forward, had not been injured through so much of the playoffs.

''Now, it's here,'' he said.
''It's been a lot of hard work and determination.

But, at the same time, he argued that Argentina could weather a rise in short-term interest rates by the United States Federal Reserve.
With many investors already expecting the Fed to raise the overnight lending rate between banks at the end of the month, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.06 percent yesterday, the highest in more than a year, from 6.02 percent on Wednesday; the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 14/32 , to 88 30/32 .
Today, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its retail sales report for May.
If the report is strong, as some forecasters expect, it might help drive interest rates higher because it will be another sign that the economy is not slowing enough to curb inflation.

In an address to money managers at a bond conference held by J. P. Morgan Securities in New York, Miguel Alberto Kiguel, the Argentine Under Secretary of Finance, noted that the spreads between interest rates on Latin American debt and those on comparable United States Treasuries ''are higher than historical levels.''
He also acknowledged being asked tough questions by foreign investors, including ''What other shock might come?''
''The Fed is making them more nervous,'' Mr. Kiguel said of investors.
According to bond indexes kept by J. P. Morgan, the spread between Latin American bonds and comparable United States Treasuries is now 8.74 percentage points, up from 7.65 before the Fed said it had shifted its bias toward a rate increase.
In Argentina, the spread is up to 7.59 percentage points, from 6.60, according to the index, while the spread in Brazil has jumped to 10.41 percentage points, from 9.20 in May.

Historically, a jump in United States interest rates has been bad for emerging markets because it raises a country's cost of borrowing and can drive foreign investors away.
Flows of foreign capital into Argentina have been a key engine of the nation's economic cycle, Mr. Kiguel said, ''so what happens to interest rates in the region will be critical.''
In addition, any rate increase that slows American economic growth will also curb growth in Latin America as Americans buy fewer of the region's exports.

Jose Luis Daza, the managing director for emerging markets at J. P. Morgan Securities, forecast continuing volatility in those markets as investors await the Fed's decision.
Still, Mr. Daza said, ''when the threat of inflation is eliminated,'' he was predicting an emerging-markets rally.
In three months, he expects the spread in the Morgan index to narrow to 9 percentage points, and, in 12 months, to just 6.5 percentage points.
The spread is now 11.33 percentage points.
But, he said, Argentina should have no problem doing this, ''even in a rough environment.''

Every year, the National Association for College Admission Counseling publishes a list in which colleges advertise the slots left open in all their classes.
This year, many of the better-known colleges that have appeared in the past are not on the list.
One result of the pressure has been that the way applicants groom themselves for college has taken on greater importance.
''It used to be that people worried about having a good resume upon leaving college,'' said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education in Washington.
''The stakes have now moved down the chain, with students wanting a good early start including good high school internships to get them into college.''
But lately, even that approach does not seem to assure success.
Matthew D. Lerner, who is graduating from high school in Swamp scott, Mass., this month, is seen by many of those around him as a model college applicant.

Mount Holyoke College is facing a similar problem with 50 more accepted students than it has room for.
So is Trinity College in Hartford.
Many other schools -- Vanderbilt in Tennessee, Pomona in California, Wabash in Indiana -- have had record years.
''I have been in this business for 30 years and I can't remember a time when there has been such a shift,'' said Carl Bewig, director of college counseling at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., one of the nation's most selective preparatory academies.
College counselors and others who watch the admissions process say that early in this season they detected crowding at the top colleges, and figured it was because it is now so easy for students, aided by computers and the Internet, to apply to many colleges.
Besides that, the thirst for brand names has never been greater, and top universities have greatly increased their financial aid as their endowments have risen with the stock market.
The theory went that at less selective institutions there would be far less pressure.
Each student might have submitted numerous applications but ultimately could choose only one college.
Then the other places would open up.
That has not turned out to be the case.
Colleges that a decade ago worried about finding enough good students are now happily overwhelmed.
An example is Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., which had a record number of applicants for the fourth straight year.

Muhlenberg feels it has improved its reputation through a building and marketing campaign.
The college, like many others, has invested in a new athletics complex and student union, intending to make it a more attractive, and has recruited and advertised around the country.
The fortunes of places like Muhlenberg are all the more remarkable when considering the growing number of alternatives to attending a private college, like on-line learning and for-profit universities, and the much cheaper alternative of state universities.
Demographers call this generation of students the baby boomlet or the baby boom echo because they are the children of the generation that bulged after World War II.

As a result, San Diego State University, with a 28 percent increase in applications this year, now requires a higher grade point average, 3.2 out of 4.0 intead of 2.5.
There are states, like West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana, where there is a projected decrease in 18-year-olds because of a drop in births in the early 1980's.
But that has not translated into reduced applications and attendance at major colleges in those states.
Indiana University and the University of Kentucky have reported excellent application pools.
West Virginia's college-age population is expected to drop by 14 percent by 2008.
Five years ago, there were 11,000 students at the university; now there are 16,000.
The consumers of higher education have grown more sophisticated.
Today, applicants roam the World Wide Web, bargain over financial aid and apply to far away colleges.
The increased willingness of students to apply to colleges at the other end of the country is a reflection of the nation's increased prosperity.
Parents have more money to spend, and colleges have far more money to offer in scholarships.

The feud has taken a turn for the worse in recent months, following the capture of the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Mr. Ocalan, who is reviled in Turkey as a terrorist responsible for thousands of deaths, was found to have been living under the protection of Greek diplomats in Kenya.
Turkish leaders accused Greece of supporting a mass murderer in an effort to sow chaos in Turkey.

If Turks are outraged by Greece's role in protecting Mr. Ocalan, Greece also has a new focus for its anger.
Turkish leaders have begun asserting that there are political ''gray zones'' in the Aegean Sea, suggesting that Turkey has designs on islands that have long been considered Greek.
Dozens of interviews in both countries suggest that the animosity between these neighbors is fed by a combination of prejudice and political competition.
But they also revealed hope that a more positive relationship might emerge out of the current trouble.
''Whenever I am in Greece, what strikes me is how alike we are,'' said Orhan Taylan, a Turkish painter who is a member of a small Greek-Turkish friendship group.
''We have the same emotions, we tell the same jokes, we eat the same food, we listen to the same music, we look at the world the same way.
That's what makes it so awful that this conflict just keeps dragging on.''
Studying the psychology of Greek-Turkish relations is a passion for the historian Hercules Millas, who was born to Greek parents in Istanbul and considers himself at home in both countries.
''Neither side has any empathy with the other or any doubt that it is 100 percent right,'' Mr. Millas said.
''The Turk you know personally may be good, but the Turkish nation as a whole is a brutal and warlike enemy.
For Turks, Greeks are liars, full of intrigues and bad intentions, definitely not to be trusted.''
Turkey has nearly six times the population of Greece, a much more powerful army and a crucial location that makes it a highly desirable ally.
Greece is more developed and widely considered more democratic, but Turkey has far greater strategic value.
H ISTORY plays a great role in creating the suspicions that infect the Greek-Turkish relationship.
These may be the only two countries in the world that fought their definitive wars of liberation against each other.
A few isolated rays of light have fallen on the Greek-Turkish relationship in the quarter-century since the Cyprus operation, but they have not been enough to brighten the darkness that has come to envelop it.
The nations have come to the brink of war several times, most recently over a barren Aegean islet in 1996.
Their naval units still conduct maneuvers in the Aegean at the same time, and their pilots routinely engage in mock dogfights.
The suspicion that many ordinary Greeks and Turks harbor for each other is fed by a remarkable lack of contact.
There is little trade between the two nations.
Greeks and Turks rarely visit each other's countries, and very few speak the other's language.

Turkish leaders insist they can begin no dialogue with Greece until the Greek Government closes what they say are camps used to train Kurdish guerrillas in Greece and declares the guerrilla group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, a terrorist organization.
But Foreign Minister Papandreou insisted in an interview that there are no guerrilla camps in Greece, and that his Government is not prepared to label the PKK terrorist.
T HE PKK is not a legal organization in Greece and is not allowed to exist here,'' Mr. Papandreou said.
''We do not say that it is or is not a terrorist group.
I think it's putting a blindfold on the problem to say that this is only a problem of terrorism.''
In the days following Mr. Ocalan's capture in Kenya last February, Greece was shaken by a political earthquake.
Their successors, including Mr. Papandreou, are considered strong supporters of the relatively moderate Prime Minister, Constantine Simitis, and less likely to embark on provocative adventures like sheltering a man who is the most wanted fugitive in a nearby country.
''We're beginning to come out of the worst of it not only unscathed, but with some very positive changes,'' said Theodore Couloumbis, director of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy.
''We're leaving behind this idea that the enemy of our enemy is our friend, which got us into this huge mess in the first place.''
Turkish anger over Greece's support for Mr. Ocalan has not faded, however, and the victory of nationalist parties in Turkey's April election may have made compromise more difficult.
One of the elder statesmen of Greek politics, Minister of Defense Apostolos Tsohatzopoulos, is among those who hope that the shock of the Ocalan affair will lead to a new dialogue.
''I see it as a chance to change the bad perceptions that exist.''

By disclosing more information about bad loans than is customary in Japan, Fuji has since managed to persuade investors that it is in no worse -- and perhaps better -- shape than other Japanese banks.
Its stock price has rallied.
Japan's system of lifetime employment also is changing, albeit slowly.
Fuji is trying to cut its payroll through attrition, not layoffs, but Mr. Hashimoto said it is changing its pay structure to reward accomplishment rather than seniority.
Fuji also has a new system of hiring in place in which some people are hired on terms that pay them more but offer no guarantee of job security.
''The old system and the new system will coexist,'' he said.
He seems to hope that some workers who are passed over for raises will choose to quit.
Skeptics about Japan note that there have been false springs before.
This time is likely to be different because growth now reflects surprisingly strong domestic spending, not the old strategy of boosting exports.
This is ''a home-grown Japanese recovery,'' says Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company.
It is also a recovery based on old-fashioned stimulus.
The Government ramped up public spending and cut interest rates as low as they could go.
Japan has not proved it can grow when such stimuli are removed, but restructurings like the one under way at Fuji provide good reason to hope that it can.
Last year the Federal Reserve, fearing that Asia's illness would infect America, cut interest rates three times.
Now, with Asia on the mend and some signs of inflation at home, the Fed is all but certain to rescind one of those cuts.
It may rightly choose to take back two of them.
That would surprise Wall Street, and show that the Fed is determined to resist inflation.
Mr. Greenspan has been an advocate of the view that technology has helped improve the economy's ability to grow without inflation, but he has been distancing himself in recent months from the notion of a ''new economy'' in which inflation is no longer a threat.

The tone of his remarks was in line with that of other Fed officials over the last month in making clear that the central bank increasingly sees early signs of problems brewing in an economy that has enjoyed a remarkable run of growth.
Economists and investors expect Mr. Greenspan to provide a relatively unambiguous signal about his intentions when he testifies about monetary policy before the committee on Thursday, a day after the Government releases figures on consumer price inflation in May.
Mr. Greenspan was the first witness at the hearings, which the Joint Economic Committee is conducting in part to discuss such issues as tax breaks for research and development and the liability of technology companies for problems involving the Year 2000 software problem.
The witnesses include William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, who will appear on Tuesday.
But the hearings also seem intended to give the Republican majority in Congress an opportunity to give a sympathetic ear to the technology industry, one of the most important battlegrounds in the fight between the parties for campaign donations, and one that Vice President Al Gore has worked hard to sew up for his Presidential race.

In highlighting the Year 2000 liability issue, the Republicans are putting on display the uncomfortable situation of the Democrats, who are trapped between their desire to court technology companies that want protection from lawsuits and the Democrats' traditional alliance with trial lawyers, who want to protect the right of computer users to sue.
He reiterated his belief that technology has been perhaps the dominant force in the economy in recent years, fostering widespread changes in the way businesses operate and contributing tremendously to the vibrancy and durability of the expansion, which is now in its ninth year.
But with investors and economists looking for any clues about future rate increases, it was his warning about the limits of technology that was most provocative.
Many economists and investors expect the central bank to push its benchmark Federal funds target rate up by a quarter-point, to 5 percent, at the end of the month.
Evidence that the economy continues to roar along, including a surge last month in retail sales, has already pushed up the long-term interest rates set by the market in recent weeks, in effect doing some of the Fed's job for it by squeezing sectors of the economy sensitive to interest rates, like housing.
Although a Fed tightening is not certain -- there are still scant signs that inflation has taken root -- the markets are increasingly asking not whether the Fed will move this month but whether the move will be a one-time action or the start of a series of rate increases that would take back all of last fall's easings.

The Fed cut rates three times last fall, in quarter-point increments, to keep the markets stable and the economy humming despite the global financial crisis.
But the financial crisis, which originated in Asia, now seems to be receding.
A surprising rebound in economic growth in Japan during the first quarter -- provided it does not turn out to be a statistical fluke -- could prove to be an important turning point.
And the fear that gripped the credit markets last fall is all but gone, replaced by more concrete concern that inflation could stage a comeback.
Moreover, as Jack Guynn, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, put it today, the ''lucky streak'' that the United States has enjoyed on inflation ''has finally run out,'' at least to the degree that price increases have been held down by economic weakness in the rest of the world.
''Energy prices are up substantially from their year-ago levels, and other commodity prices have risen, too,'' Mr. Guynn said in a speech to a business group in Atlanta.
''What's happened, of course, is that as the economies of Asia and elsewhere have turned the corner to recovery, global demand has picked up, and so have prices.''
But he offered a list of issues that worry him, including ''the residual stimulus'' from last fall's rate cuts; signals that the bond market is increasingly concerned about inflation; rapid growth in the money supply, and the very low unemployment rate, which is 4.2 percent.

Mr. Milosevic still controls the crucial levers of power, namely the security forces, and does not look close to losing his grip.
But the Orthodox Church's call for his resignation has added to speculation about Mr. Milosevic's political future, when he is already damaged by the recent indictment from the international war crimes tribunal, and as he faces the end of his presidential term in 2001.
While only a small minority of Serbs practice religion, the church does bear some moral weight.
But the church's position represents the loss of an important portion of support for Mr. Milosevic.
The church expressed deep concern over what has happened in Kosovo, in particular the recent exodus of Serbs.
The church called on the international peacekeeping forces to provide protection to Serbian civilians and to the many Orthodox monasteries and churches there, including its ancient seat in Pec in western Kosovo.
''We also appeal to our brothers in Kosovo to stay in their homes and not to leave their relics, convinced in the truth of Jesus Christ's words that 'Those who endure till the end will be saved.'
''

Mr. Milosevic, who built his career on championing the Kosovo Serbs, has now dropped them unceremoniously.
More than 30,000 have fled their homes in the last four days, according to the Yugoslav Red Cross, and they have received barely a mention on state television.
Mr. Milosevic clearly feels the need to woo back the public to his side after the war, which at first drew the people behind him in patriotic fervor against NATO but which is now widely seen as disastrous for the country.

While many Serbs still blame NATO, opposition politicians are becoming more outspoken.

''Since Kosovo is now occupied we have no reason to remain in the Government,'' Mr. Seselj said, adding that one of the only reasons the Radical Party joined the Government had been to defend Kosovo Metohija, the province's full Serbian name.
If the Radical Party does leave the Government, it opens the way for changes.
Mr. Milosevic may invite the main democratic opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serb Renewal Party, to join.
Mr. Draskovic, in Mr. Milosevic's Government as Deputy Prime Minister for several months this year, said today that he would demand ''fundamental democratic reforms'' before joining the Government again.
''If they are not ready, and are ready to continue with their wrong policy of leading Serbia to disaster, the majority of Serbs would not allow that,'' he said at a news conference here.
Mr. Draskovic instead attacked the powerful Yugoslav Prime Minister, Momir Bulatovic, who he says should be replaced.
It may suit the Yugoslav President to shuffle his Government.
He may try to use politicians like Mr. Draskovic, and the President of the republic of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, to court Western aid and investment to help rebuild Serbia.
A change may also appease the public, facing a grim next six months of economic hardship, with shortages of electricity, heat and jobs.
Since Mr. Milosevic's term ends next year, and unless he changes the rules, he is not permitted to run again, after two consecutive terms as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
He may be tempted to call early elections and change the rules, analysts say, although that would be expensive and risky.
He is also hampered by the situation in Kosovo, since many of his party seats were won there.
It is unlikely that Kosovo will participate in national elections soon and Mr. Milosevic can no longer count on its strong support.

Payday lending companies are sprouting up all over the country, having increased to nearly 8,000 today from 300 seven years ago.
Although this is most prosperous peacetime decade of the century, many workers have become trapped by debts run up in free spending or have been driven deeper into debt by misfortune.
But these workers have the two basic things needed to obtain a payday loan: paychecks and checking accounts.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Although plentiful in big cities like New York and Los Angeles, the payday lenders have become most visible in places like Kokomo; Springfield, Ohio, and Cleveland, Tenn.
Ten have opened in Kokomo, a city of 45,000 people.
Bearing names like Check Into Cash, Check 'n Go and Fast Cash, payday lenders grant loans to workers against their next paychecks.
In return, the companies charge a ''fee,'' typically $15 to $35.
At annual rates, the fees normally exceed 300 percent and 400 percent and in some cases they reach four digits.
At least a dozen national chains have sprung up.
The biggest, Ace Cash Express in Irving, Tex., has around 900 stores and revenue last year -- what it collected in loan fees -- of $100 million, twice that of 1996.
In much of the country, these companies escape the routine scrutiny and regulation faced by banks, finance companies and pawn shops, because in some states they are too new to have stirred much controversy and in others they have used political clout to stave off legislation.
As of late last year, the Consumer Federation of America reported that 19 states, including all of those in New England, as well as Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, prohibited payday lending, most by limiting annual, small-loan interest to less than 40 percent.
A spokesman for the New York State Banking Department, Rick Hansen, disputed this assertion, saying the state's usury law forbids charging more than 25 percent annual interest on any loan.
The payday lenders say they are providing a vital service.
As commercial banks have shunned the poorest borrowers, in part by raising the minimum amounts they will lend, people who need small sums to get over a hump, like paying for a medical prescription or buying tires for a car, have few choices.
These include people who are unable to get credit cards or who have charged or exceeded their cards' credit limits.
Industry leaders say comparing payday lenders' fees with annual interest rates is unfair because most of the loans are paid off within a month.

Consumer advocates consider the interest rates exorbitant.
''I know of loan sharks in New York who wouldn't charge this kind of interest,'' said Gary L. Calhoun, a lawyer here who provides legal services for members of the United Automobile Workers.
State Representative Richard W. Bodiker of Indiana, a Democrat whose bill this year to regulate the lenders fell to intense industry lobbying, calls the fees ''in excess of what usury laws consider loan-sharking.''
''No major direct deposit provider has been convicted of that.''
One reason for the lenders' growth is people's comfort with debt.
The nation's savings rate, the percentage of people's disposable income that is saved, dropped to 0.5 percent last year and to nothing at all by earlier this year from 6 percent a decade ago.
Rather than save, people are spending more than ever and borrowing more than ever.
''We know there's a pretty sizable group of folks whose credit cards are maxed out,'' said Mark B. Tarpey, a supervisor in the consumer finance division of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions.
With payday lenders around, Mr. Tarpey said: ''They don't have to tell the boss they need a cash advance.
They don't have to give up their TV's and furniture.
They don't have to run a credit check.''
Another reason is a level of unemployment, 4.2 percent, that economists used to call unattainable.
To succeed, payday lenders need customers with bank accounts and regular checks, in particular paychecks, and these days, just about every able-bodied adult receives one.

Under such conditions, said Mr. Rochford, the deputy counsel for the check cashers' association, payday lenders' revenues will grow to $1.44 billion this year from $810 million last year.
Payday lending exists, Mr. Rochford said, ''because there's a need for it.''
A short-term deferred deposit loan, the industry's preferred term, helps a worker through an emergency and is cheaper than bouncing a check.
Most banks do not make loans for less than $1,000, he said, and pawning is embarrassing.
Borrowers like a payday loan, Mr. Rochford said, because ''it is private,'' adding: ''It is quick.
And they do not need a lot of documentation.''
The fees cover loans that turn sour, he said, and the cost of employees to process loans.
Kokomo, about 50 miles north of Indianapolis, may be a case in point.
A steel and asphalt city of immense new Daimler-Chrysler and Delphi-Delco automobile component factories, Kokomo is fertile terrain for payday lending.

Strapped by bad credit and unmanageable or unexpected expenses, people here used to go to pawn shops for loans.
But of three pawn shops here two years ago, one has closed, and another, Bob's, passed up renewing its license this month.
Now people go to the city's new payday lenders.
Unemployment, which has exceeded 20 percent in Kokomo in recessions, was just 1.4 percent in March, according to the latest survey by the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University.
About 20,000 people, roughly 40 percent of the area work force, is employed by automotive companies.
They earn $50,000 to $60,000 a year and are the new lenders' biggest customers.
The payday lenders here approve most loans within 10 minutes.
''No Credit Check, Instant Approval,'' Easy Money's flier promises.
For this service, some states specify a maximum fee of $15 on a one- or two-week loan of $100 or $200.
In Indiana the limit is $33.
At $33, the annual rate on a two-week $100 loan is 858 percent.
And as borrowers amass loans, taking new ones to pay the fees on the others, the fastest way to payday becomes a fast way, too, to garnished wages and bankruptcy.

Kathy Jo King, 41, earns almost $60,000 a year as an assembly-line worker at the Daimler-Chrysler transmission plant.
But she has no savings, in part because she is paying creditors $113 a week to work her way out of a bankruptcy that followed a serious automobile accident that left her husband partly disabled and both with high medical bills.
Then early last year, Ms. King and her husband and their boys, 18 and 11, had to move, incurring $1,500 in unexpected expenses.
''I've got kids to feed,'' she said.
With her credit in ruins, she could not go to a bank for a loan, so she went to payday lenders.
''They make you feel real at ease about it.''
So one lender tried to redeem her last $330 check covering a loan of $300 and a fee of $30.
With the $80 for bouncing the check, Ms. King owes $1,280 on her original loan of $330.
Currently, about 100 payday lender suits against borrowers are on file in the Howard County Superior Court in Kokomo.
Lenders here also send out letters threatening customers with imprisonment for bouncing a loan check, although none is known to have tested the state penal code provision that they invoke in making the threat.
Some lenders start taking legal action within a month to obtain unpaid loans; others try to work with customers to avoid a lawsuit.
Ms. Brenner now has 350 clients and charges less than most lenders: $20 for a two-week $100 loan, for an annual percentage rate of 521 percent, and $30 for $200, or 391 percent.

Unlike some lenders, Ms. Brenner lets her clients pay off portions of their loans as they extend them and in that way work them down.
And to avert probable trips to small-claims court, she says she will not lend to people who already have more than two loans from other payday lenders.
The biggest borrowers, many lenders say, are not Kokomo's low-wage service workers, but auto industry employees who earn more than $20 an hour.
''Most of my customers are from Chrysler and Delco,'' said Marc Sutherland, manager of the Kokomo office of Nationwide Budget Finance.
Shari Harris, 39, who earns around $25,000 a year as an information security analyst, was managing money well enough until the father of her two children, 10 and 4, stopped paying $1,200 a month in child support.
She qualified immediately for a two-week $150 loan at Check Into Cash, handing it a check for $183 to include the $33 fee.
''That's the sickness of it,'' Ms. Harris said.
So she asked her employer to stop paying her wages into her checking account, emptying it, and putting her checks into a savings account.
She took a second job, working in a department store, and turned to the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, which worked out a plan under which she is paying $440 a month to work down the loans.
Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America and a prominent critic of payday lending, said, ''There's nothing wrong with small loans at reasonable interest rates, reasonable terms and reasonable collection practices.

''But these practices are designed to keep you in perpetual debt.''
And while the payment will close the books on the original investors' experience, it is not clear how this drama will end for the fund's rescuers, some of Wall Street's largest institutions, and for its founding partners, who are already discussing forming a new money-management venture.

The hedge fund, founded in mid-1994 by a bond-market star, John W. Meriwether of Salomon Brothers, seemed to be touched by magic in its first three years of operation, enhancing Mr. Meriwether's already formidable reputation and generating wealth for his partners, who included two Nobel Prize-winning economists.
But in August, a debt crisis in Russia set off a worldwide scramble for the safety of United States Treasury securities, distorting interest-rate patterns.
Consequently, officials at the New York Federal Reserve Bank helped 14 banks and brokerage houses form a consortium to make an emergency $3.6 billion investment in the fund.
Under the plan the rescuers got a 90 percent stake in the fund, reducing the original outside investors' stake to just under 10 percent, with Mr. Meriwether and the other managing partners retaining only a tiny sliver of equity.

Since then, markets have stabilized, and the fund has steadily reduced the riskiness of its holdings and improved its investment results.
In addition to cashing out the original investors, the fund will also be making a partial payment to the consortium that bailed it out in September.

One person who knows about the plan said that somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million would be distributed to the consortium, which includes the Bankers Trust Corporation, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, Goldman Sachs Group, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Merrill Lynch & Company, J. P. Morgan & Company, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, and Citigroup, along with six European banks.
Not everyone involved with the hedge fund will fare as well as the original investors, who included top Wall Street executives, as well as a unit of the Bank of Italy.
Various Merrill Lynch executives in that company's deferred compensation plan began tying their future earnings to the then-impressive hedge fund's results in April 1998 -- rather like boarding the Titanic just in time for the iceberg collision.
They missed the handsome cash distributions, and apparently will suffer the full damage of the subsequent meltdown.
Of course, Mr. Meriwether and the other founding partners of Long-Term Capital also saw their equity in the fund virtually evaporate in the course of last fall's rescue.
But the damage done to the bank accounts and professional reputations of the founding partners does not seem to have dissolved the glue that binds them to Mr. Meriwether.
People who have been told the contents of E-mail that has circulated at the fund's offices in Greenwich say that at least five of Mr. Meriwether's original colleagues from the Salomon Brothers bond desk -- Eric Rosenfeld, Lawrence Hilibrand, Richard Leahy, Victor Hagani and Arjun Krishnamachar -- have agreed to join him in exploring the possibility of forming some new investment venture within the next six to 12 months.
It is likely that this new venture will be approaching potential sources of investment capital later this year, these people said.
Among those who will not be joining Mr. Meriwether's faithful band will be David W. Mullins Jr., who quit as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve to become a partner in Long-Term Capital.
Two other jewels in Mr. Meriwether's crown, the Nobel laureate economists Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, have already left the fund.

For Many, Drug Testing Is Becoming Medical Care

In recent years, the need for test subjects in experimental drug trials has exploded as the industry has brought to market an ever-increasing number of new products.
In response, drug companies have developed new methods of finding participants for the trials by turning to private-practice doctors who recruit from their lists of patients.
But even that influx of participants has not been enough to satisfy the demand.
Filling the gap, according to industry officials and researchers, are chronically ill patients with limited or no health insurance who rely on clinical trials as their primary source of medical care.
For these people, experiments have become treatments.

Although stock traders appear to have accepted that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point next week, Christopher Durbin, chief investment strategist at J. P. Morgan Investment Inc., which manages more than $300 billion, said the central bank would most likely have to increase rates much more than that to slow the economy.
At a luncheon with reporters in New York yesterday, Mr. Durbin said short-term interest rates would probably rise a full percentage point over the next year.
Traders said the rise in long-term interest rates yesterday was caused by positioning in front of a heavy calendar of coming corporate debt issues.
And the rising rates probably did not help brokerage stocks.

JEFF VAN GUNDY walked out on the news media at yesterday's shoot-around after getting fed up with a squabble that was going on between a reporter and a television cameraman while he was trying to speak.
''Can't we all get along?''
Then, when the cameraman yanked a tape recorder out of the reporter's hand, Van Gundy said: ''You know what; I'm done.

''I feel such an inner peace whenever I listen to him talk, so I never miss a chance to see him or hear him,'' said Sebastiana Pereira de Souza, 46, a fruit vendor, who says she has also bought several copies of Father Rossi's record to give to friends.
''He transmits the word of God with such tenderness, like an angel who has descended among us.''

Perhaps even more than other Latin American countries, Brazil has a long tradition of popular religiosity focused on charismatic figures.
Father Rossi may be another expression of that tendency, but he ''speaks to a very different audience in a very different way,'' said Ralph della Cava, an expert on religion in Brazil who teaches at Queens College in New York.
''He addresses a largely urban audience of young people in a world permeated by secular values, proposing a set of alternative values through the medium that has always been the most important in Brazil, the popular music of the day.''
His emergence is also notable because of where it occurs.
Under Paulo Evaristo Cardinal Arns in the 1970's and 80's, the Catholic Church here in Brazil's largest city was a stronghold of liberation theology, a blend of Catholic and Marxist doctrine that Pope John Paul II has sought to discourage.
After serving a year in the Brazilian Army, he became an instructor at an exercise academy here, spending much of his income, he said, on body-building supplements and equipment intended to bulk up his 6-foot-4 athlete's frame.

Even today, traces of Father Rossi's days in the gym can be detected in the way he celebrates Mass.
As he sings rock-flavored tunes like ''Angels of God'' and ''I Breathe,'' he waves his arms and and kneels and jumps about with an energy and fervor that recall James Brown in his prime, inviting the faithful to do the same, and afterward, he often leads the congregation in a session of what he calls ''the Lord's aerobics.''
''Before, the music you heard in church was enough to put you to sleep,'' said Antonio Carlos de Oliveira, 57, an automobile worker who attends three of Father Rossi's services each week.
''But not now.
The prayers are songs, so you feel better and you are also participating.
It's good for your health and good for your soul.''

As his popularity and influence have grown, though, Father Rossi has also drawn detractors.
Fundamentalist Protestant ministers, who have made significant inroads in Brazil in recent years, complain vociferously that he has copied their preaching style and even their musical repertory.
Liberation theology advocates within the Roman Catholic Church here have criticized him too, though mostly indirectly.
''The Eucharist is not a show,'' Msgr.
Pedro Casaldaliga, the combatively progressive bishop of Sao Felix do Araguaia in the Amazon, said when asked about Father Rossi's approach.
''What frightens me is to see a pop star priest,'' Frei Betto, one of the leading theoreticians of liberation theology, wrote in a recent essay addressed to Father Rossi.
He added that, rather than appearing on television, ''I prefer to appear among the excluded, on the periphery, among the landless and homeless.''
Still, Father Rossi maintained, over the years liberation theology has led to ''a certain exaggeration of the social pastoral at the expense of the Mass.''
And while ''the church has to give preference to the poor, that must be done without excluding others,'' he added.
''We need to seek an equilibrium.''
There is also a more traditionalist faction within the church that, as Dr. della Cava put it, sees Father Rossi's approach as ''not intellectual enough, as fun-and-games, short-cut Christianity that panders to popular opinion.''
To those conservative critics, Father Rossi replies that what he is doing is merely using music to glorify the word of God, just as his predecessors did centuries ago with Gregorian chants.
And with a grin, he buttresses his position with a citation from St. Augustine: ''He who sings prays twice.''

The three buildings already under construction include the 100,000-square-foot Gateway 100 in Woodbury, renting for $27.50 a square foot, which the Tilles Companies of Woodbury expects to complete by December; the 100,000-square-foot Three Greenway Plaza in Melville being built by Greenway Plaza Office Park and renting for $26 a square foot, to be completed in September, and Fortunato Development's 60,000-square-foot One Corporate Drive in Bohemia, which is renting for $22 a square foot and is also to be ready for occupancy in September.

Two additional projects -- one in Melville and the other in Hauppauge -- are expected to break ground before the end of the year.
The Tritec Real Estate Company of East Setauket is awaiting final approvals from the Town of Smithtown, but hopes to start by the fall on a 408,000-square-foot two-building complex at 100 Motor Parkway in Hauppauge.
Tilles also expects to start a three-building complex in Melville with 520,000 square feet before the end of the year.
At the Hauppauge project, annual rents will start at $29 a square foot; in Tilles's Melville project, they will be $28 a foot.
Both projects will be built in phases.
Large blocks of existing space are also coming on the market, notably 600,000 square feet in two buildings in Jericho being vacated by the Chase Manhattan Bank in the next two years, and the 209,000-square-foot former Long Island Savings Bank building at 201 Old Country Road in Melville.
A partnership of the Parr Organization of Ronkonkoma and Pitcairn Properties of Jenkinstown, Pa., is in contract to purchase the Melville building and will subdivide it.
Even with so much new space in the pipeline, brokers say they do not foresee a glut.
The current overall vacancy rate for Class A office space -- larger, newer buildings with amenities and in good locations -- on Long Island is 6.3 percent.
With the current vacancy rate so low, said Theodore J. Stratigos, a senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield of Long Island, ''we may see a 2 percent rise when these buildings come on line but we could afford a 5 percent increase and not have problems.''
He added that it was ''very good that we finally have some new buildings going up.''
''Competition creates another reason for a tenant to expand or relocate to Long Island because it gives tenants opportunities and options,'' said Gus P. Nuzzolese, senior executive director at Sutton & Edwards, commercial brokers in Lake Success.
''We like to have an inventory of about two years and based on the last two years' absorption rate, these buildings will be fitting into this scheme perfectly.''
Richard Karson, director at the Syosset office of Insignia/ESG, said that Tilles, Reckson and Tritec were ''all responding to the problem of where are they going to put their tenants as they grow.''
The building, called Melville Square, ''was the springboard for us going forward on the new project.''

One of Melville Square's new tenants will be Merrill Lynch, which now occupies 18,000 square feet at Reckson's building at 200 Broadhollow Road, but needed more space.
It will move to 30,000 square feet in Melville Square on Sept. 2, adding 30 people to its sales force of 40.

Other landlords also say their new buildings are drawing many of their own tenants.
''We have two or three tenants who want to consolidate the space they have and grow, and the only way they can do that with us is in the new building,'' said Roger Tilles, one of the principals of Tilles, which owns 3.5 million square feet of industrial and office space in Woodbury.
Mr. Tilles said he was talking to several tenants ''who would more than fill the building,'' if the deals go through.
(Traditionally, tenants are reluctant to sign a lease in a new building until construction is substantially complete.)
Fortunato Development has one signed tenant -- the Long Island Sports & Rehabilitation Center, which is taking 10,000 square feet -- but three additional tenants whose leases are not yet signed would together take 35,000 square feet, said Paul T. Fortunato, the company's real estate manager.
The developer's Airport Corporate Center in Bohemia, which contains two additional buildings with 200,000 square feet, is fully leased, Mr. Fortunato said.
One of the prospective tenants for the new building is Routemaster.com, a company that provides integrated Internet-based business solutions to the freight transportation industry.
It will be vacating 5,000 square feet at Airport Corporate Plaza and taking 14,000 square feet in the new building, which will serve as the new headquarters for the two-year-old company, said its chairman, Kenneth L. Miller.
The company plans to relocate with 40 employees by December.
''If it weren't for the new building, we would strongly consider moving out of state because I could easily operate elsewhere,'' Mr. Miller said.
Landlords without new space to offer say they face full occupancy but no space for tenants who want to grow.

''You really need inventory in order to attract companies to Long Island and to keep the economy healthy and moving along,'' said David Pennetta, executive director of Oxford & Simpson, commercial brokers in Jericho.
''We have many entrepreneurial companies, and a company in 10,000 square feet today may be in 200,000 square feet five years from now.''
''By bringing trophy buildings on line, we can demonstrate that we stand on our own and have our own economic hub here,'' he said.
Developers say everything seems to point to a positive outcome for their new crop of buildings.
''The Long Island office market from what we can see is stronger than ever and will be at least for the next two years, interest rates are still good, rents are moving up, the economy is tremendous and diversified,'' said Bob J. Coughlan, the co-managing partner of Tritec.
The Pitcairn-Parr partnership, which is renovating the former Long Island Savings Bank building in Melville, already has a major Long Island company about to sign a lease for 32,000 of the 205,000 square feet, with options for an additional 68,000 feet.
''We have 10 additional prospects all looking in the 20,000-square-foot range,'' said Ronald Parr, the president of the Parr Organization.
''Do I think all the new construction is needed?
Yes, and then some because we have so many people coming to us, we can't accommodate them all.''
The tale of Hingis, the century's youngest No.
1 when she was 16 and Wimbledon's youngest champion in 1997, has devolved into a sob story in 1999.
Hingis, now 18, seems to have come into her adolescent rebellion belatedly, and so far she and her results are suffering for it.

Her verbal outbursts have included a derogatory reference to Amelie Mauresmo, runner-up to her in the Australian Open, as ''half a man'' after she announced her lesbianism there; a description of Jana Novotna, her discarded doubles partner and Wimbledon's defending singles and doubles champion, as ''old and slow,'' and a snide remark about Steffi Graf being over the hill in a game populated by a group Hingis likes to call the Spice Girls of Tennis.
Under close scrutiny by the British press, as well as officials of the WTA Tour, was Dokic's father, Damir, who introduced himself to the limelight three weeks ago by getting thrown out of the Edgbaston event for causing a ruckus.
But Damir Dokic, who recently dismissed Lester Bowrey, the Australian Fed Cup captain, as his daughter's coach and tennis confidant, has been given the tabloid label ''the tennis father from hell.''
He seems to be replacing the parent of another of Wimbledon 1999's emergent teens.
Lucic has since accused her father of physically and emotionally abusive conduct and has cut all ties to him.
Now 17 and based at the Bollettieri Sports Academy in Bradenton, Fla., Lucic is making a comeback after settling her domestic woes and hiring a coach, Joe Giuliano, skilled in the art of constructive, not destructive, criticism.

Stevenson's Wimbledon idyll has not been free of controversies, generated by remarks made by her mother during impromptu news conferences.
According to Samantha Stevenson, a freelance sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times as well as other publications, Alexandra, who is black, has been subjected to racist remarks and a general lack of respect by opponents on the WTA Tour.
The Stevensons are also in a dispute with the tour, which maintains that Alexandra -- who decided to turn pro for this tournament -- entered the tournament as an amateur and is not entitled to prize money.
Samantha Stevenson says that she informed the tournament committee at the Wimbledon qualifying tournament about Alexandra's intent to turn pro.
in order to follow in the footprints of her role models Venus and Serena Williams.
''I will be ready with my serve-and-volley game and forehand; I'm taking it one match at a time and looking one step forward.
I'm in the moment.''
For the moment, they all are.
One recent piece of evidence suggesting a strong human influence, which seems likely to carry some weight with the intergovernmental panel, appeared recently in the journal Nature.
Scientists at the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research, a British Government organization, analyzed the global climate record of the last century in an effort to isolate and quantify the major factors producing the century's rise of about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the earth's average surface temperature.

The research team led by Dr. Simon F. B. Tett found that in the earlier part of the century, the rise could be explained either by an increase in solar radiation or a combination of stronger solar radiation and heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted by industrial economies.
Other researchers have lately come to a similar conclusion.
The Tett study represents ''another jigsaw puzzle piece,'' said one expert, Dr. Tom M. L. Wigley of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ''There is still a long way to go'' in completing the puzzle, he said, ''but we're beginning to see the smile on the face of the Mona Lisa, I think -- or perhaps it should be a frown.''
Dr. Wigley was a principal author of the section of the intergovernmental panel's 1995 report dealing with detection of the human imprint on climate, but not for the new report.
One, Dr. Michael E. Schlesinger, a climatologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says that experts have insufficient knowledge of the magnitude of natural climatic variations, especially solar radiation, to gauge how large the human impact is by comparison.
Another, Dr. Ronald Prinn of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that although there was ''accumulating evidence that humans are having an influence on the climate system,'' it would not be possible to discern its magnitude until the degree of natural climate variability could be pinned down better.
Meanwhile, though, evidence of warming and its effects continues to mount.
This and other analyses have found that the warmest years of all occurred in the 1990's, with 1998 the warmest on record.
El Nino, the great pool of warm water in the tropical Pacific Ocean that from time to time heats the atmosphere and disrupts weather patterns, was responsible for some of the 1998 heating.
A preliminary analysis by Dr. Wigley, however, has shown that when El Nino's effects are filtered out of the global temperature record statistically, 1998 still ranks as the warmest year.
(This year is also shaping up as unusually warm, but not as warm as 1998.)
Two studies reported in Nature this month suggest that the warming is being reflected in patterns of wildlife behavior and distribution.
In one study, Dr. Camille Parmesan, a biologist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis in Santa Barbara, Calif., and 12 colleagues analyzed distribution patterns of 35 species of European butterflies.

In the other study, Humphrey Q.
They found that, again coincident with a recent warming trend, the birds were laying their eggs earlier in the spring.
This is the latest in a series of studies indicating that meteorological spring is coming earlier in the Northern Hemisphere.
Some have also shown that fall is coming later.
A third study in Nature this month reports, on the basis of bubbles of atmospheric gas contained in ice cores extracted from the Antarctic ice sheet, that present-day atmospheric levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide are higher than at any other time in the last 420,000 years.
At 360 parts per million, they are 20 percent higher than in any previous warm period between ice ages, and double the typical concentrations during an ice age.

If greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, the United Nations scientific panel has consistently said, atmospheric concentrations will continue to rise and warm the earth further.
The warming would not end in 2100, the panel found, but would continue.
By comparison, the earth has warmed by 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age some 20,000 years ago.
The amount of warming projected by the panel, it said, would create widespread climatic and ecological changes, including a shift in climatic zones, an increase in heat waves, warmer northern winters, increased precipitation when it rains but worse droughts when it does not, and a rise in sea level that could inundate many small island nations and drive tens of millions of people away from the coasts when storm surges develop.
For a long time, the global warming debate focused on how much warming a given increase in greenhouse gases -- say, a doubling of atmospheric concentrations -- would produce.
Though skeptics say it would be small, the dominant view for 20 years has been that a doubling would produce a warming of 3 to 8 degrees, other things being equal.
This is a measure of the climate system's sensitivity to ''forcing,'' as experts call it, by external heating and cooling influences, and many mainstream scientists say confidence that it is right has grown.
Now attention is shifting to the relative strength of the external forcings.
This is the crux of the problem of figuring out the magnitude of humans' influence on the climate.
There are basically three main forcings: greenhouse gases and solar radiation, which warm the atmosphere, and sulfate droplets, or aerosols, from both volcanoes and industrial sources, which cool it.
The amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been firmly established and continuously monitored, though it is difficult if not impossible to predict how much there will be in the future.
Once greenhouse gases diffuse throughout the entire lower part of the atmosphere they remain there for decades to centuries.
Sulfate aerosols from volcanoes sometimes spread to the stratosphere, where they, too, diffuse globally and cool the earth.
But they dissipate in two or three years.
Sulfate aerosols from industry generally rise only into the lower part of the atmosphere and fall out, as acid rain, within a few days.
Moreover, their extent and impact is mostly regional rather than global.
Until recently, they affected primarily the industrial countries of Europe and North America, but scientists now believe that they are diminishing in that part of the world because of controls on pollution.
They are growing fast, however, in India, China and Southeast Asia.

Experts have difficulty in getting a handle on the constantly shifting amounts and patterns of industrial aerosols, and they have a similarly hard time establishing the varying strength of solar radiation.
Some mainstream scientists say that because the earth's average surface temperature has not varied by more than a degree or two since the last ice age, variations in the strength of the sun's radiation must be relatively small during the present interglacial period.
Satellite measurements show some small variations, less than one-tenth of a percent, in concert with the 11-year sunspot cycle.
But for the years before 1978, when satellite measurements began, scientists must estimate the variations from proxy indicators like sunspots.
These estimates say that solar irradiance did not increase by more than 1 percent from 1908 to 1952.
In the recent Tett study, the British scientists fed into a computer model of the climate system varying estimates, based on different proxy studies, of past solar irradiance.
They also fed in the observed and estimated changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols from both volcanoes and industrial sources.
Since the 1970's, the simulations revealed, global warming cannot be explained without a large impact from greenhouse gases.
Dr. Schlesinger, the University of Illinois climatologist, says he has ''a couple of problems'' with the study.
First, he says, the data on solar variability before 1978 are unreliable.
Second, the climate system's natural internal variability, apart from external forcings, is quite large relative to the observed warming and has not been well quantified.
For example, he says, there is a growing body of evidence that the warming in the early part of the century resulted from a natural oscillation in the surface temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean.
The larger point, Dr. Schlesinger says, is that the climate system's internal variations may be so large that they render the Tett findings' statistical significance weaker.
Nonetheless, Dr. Tett says he believes the findings strengthen the United Nations panel's 1995 conclusion about a human impact on climate.
The struggle to gauge that impact goes on.
''The important question,'' Dr. Prinn says, ''is numbers'' -- precise estimates of the relative weight of natural and human factors.
''It could be there are big environmental issues involved here,'' he says, ''or relatively modest ones.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell below 6 percent, closing at 5.96 percent.

In fact, a continued rise in stock prices could offset the slowing effect of today's increase and could prompt the Fed to raise rates even more.
Its quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate could lead to an increase in loan rates for businesses and consumer credit like auto and home-equity loans.
But interest rates that are set directly or indirectly in the financial markets, like those on mortgages and corporate bonds, will depend on whether investors think the likelihood of further rate increases has been diminished and that inflation is no threat.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has warned over the last several months that although there is almost no inflation, there is an increasing risk that continued robust growth could push wages and then prices into an upward spiral.
Market interest rates had been moving higher over the last several months in anticipation of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, helping to cool off rate-sensitive sectors of the economy like housing.
But economic indicators have given mixed signals in recent weeks about the prospects for slowing, and analysts said the Fed's shift to a neutral stance today was intended to say that the central bank would wait for more data before deciding how to proceed rather than that it was finished tightening monetary policy for the year.
''In the end the decision is going to be dependent on the economic environment.''
In explaining its decision, the Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee remained open to what has become known as the ''new age'' economic paradigm: that huge investments in computers and other technology have made businesses so much more efficient that the economy can run at much higher levels than in the past, and at lower rates of unemployment, without generating inflation.

''Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures,'' the committee said.
''Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the F.O.M.C.
has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action.''

The statement went on, however, to emphasize that the Fed's tolerance for strong growth and low unemployment has its limits.
''The committee nonetheless recognizes that in the current dynamic environment, it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that might undermine growth,'' the statement said.
Since the Fed cut rates three times last fall, the economy has grown, and the financial crisis that started in Asia and spread around the world has abated.
The central bank justified the rate increase today in those terms, saying ''the full degree'' of last fall's rate reductions is ''no longer necessary'' to keep financial markets well oiled and the economy in the United States on an even keel.
If history is any guide, the shift to a neutral policy stance, or bias, is no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates when it next meets on Aug. 24.
The central bank has traditionally moved back to a neutral bias after raising rates even when another rate increase seemed likely.
What is different this time around is that the Fed is disclosing its policy bias publicly after each meeting.
Whatever the Fed's intentions, the market's response today was to send stock prices higher, making consumers feel that much wealthier and willing to spend, and to bring down bond yields, providing a kick to the economy that could well offset whatever slowing effect the increase in official short-term rates accomplishes.
''In the process of making this announcement, the Fed has greatly reduced the odds that the economy is going to slow down,'' said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
''The fear of Greenspan has been removed from the financial markets.
That means the restrictiveness on the economy that had been put in place based on the expectation of higher rates has been removed.''
Investors could reassess their initial reaction in coming days, as they often do when it comes to the Fed's hints about policy.
But they are most likely to take their cue from key indicators of growth and inflation in coming weeks, starting with job creation and the unemployment rate for June on Friday.

Still, an array of politicians and business executives who had been pressing Mr. Greenspan to show restraint in slowing the economy given the absence of inflation took heart from the Fed's signals today.
''Given the dearth of inflation and strong but steady growth, today's decision was, in my judgment, an error, but a minor one,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, which has long argued that the economy's potential for noninflationary growth is much higher than the Fed recognizes.
''The metaphor suggesting that a little inflation is like the genie out of the bottle is simply wrong,'' Mr. Reich said.
''We know empirically that inflation can be stopped.
More to the point, the lag between when the Fed acts and the response in the economy is actually very small, because financial markets are extraordinarily efficient and respond very quickly.''
Overcoming an early stumble, stock prices climbed steadily yesterday to finish with sizable gains despite a rise in interest rates.
The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 1 8/32 to 89 20/32 .
''The stock and bond markets seem to be taking different views,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation.
Bond people, he said, are impressed by the fact that Federal Reserve rate increases are rarely one-shot exercises and that it was not all that encouraging that the Fed dropped its bias to tighten while raising rates Wednesday.
The Fed has traditionally done this, he added, albeit without an immediate announcement.

Stock market participants, on the other hand, were largely convinced, Mr. Ghriskey said, that the Fed was merely taking back an extra rate cut tied to global turmoil and that the economy would keep bounding ahead, as implied by the manufacturing figures released by the National Association of Purchasing Management.
There was no clear pattern in the day's brisk stock trading, however, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite rising 20.06 points, to close at 2,706.18, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 8.25 points, to close at 1,380.96.

''The market is reacting well'' to the week's economic reports and the Fed action, said Paul Rich, a trader at BT Brokerage.
''This is real positive, real institutional, too,'' he added, expressing confidence that the imminent start of the quarterly earnings-report season would give a further lift to stocks.
''Nobody can think of anything that's going to spoil the picnic,'' said Lawrence D. Cavanagh, an options specialist at Value Line.

He then began giving speeches on fighting cancer.
He fell in love with Lebanon while working there in the early 1960's as an accountant for a New York firm.

For their part, consumers are not quite so irresponsible as the savings figures suggest.
Although they are amassing debt, their overall financial condition is not deteriorating, in large part because the stock market boom and rising real estate values are making them wealthier, at least on paper, even if their cash flow is out of whack.
The technical definition of savings includes bank deposits and money invested in stocks, bonds or retirement savings -- basically any after-tax income that a consumer does not spend.
But it does not include the capital gains on investments or retirement plans.

Still, the contrast between promised Government rectitude and personal profligacy is jarring.
On the one hand, Mr. Clinton was making the case that one of the great benefits of fiscal responsibility and debt reduction is lower interest rates, since the Government's reduced borrowing needs leaves more capital available for businesses and consumers.
On the other, the Federal Reserve was raising rates to snuff out any smoldering inflationary pressures generated by an economy that is already red hot.
Making matters even more complicated, the updated surplus projections led Republicans to step up their push for a big tax cut, which if enacted would stoke the economy even as the Fed is trying to cool it off.
(To add to the conundrum, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is one of the most fervent advocates in Washington of lower taxes.
Congress is likely to heed his call for another cut in the capital gains tax, which would further fuel the turbo-charged stock market, whose lofty valuations have been keeping Mr. Greenspan awake at night for years.)
THERE'S good news, though.
These apparent quandaries are the interwoven byproducts of prosperity.
Take the issue of personal savings and national debt.
Arguably, the Government owes its opportunity to reduce the debt to consumers, who as much as any other force have kept the economy and the stock market steaming along and generating the flood of tax revenues that has transformed deficit into surplus.
To the degree that Americans are spendthrifts, it is because they are confident about their own prospects.
By opening their wallets, they are creating jobs and fomenting competition that leads to innovation and efficiency.
And while their credit card balances might be a bit steep, their household balance sheets are quite healthy if assets like stocks and houses are taken into account.
The ratio of household liabilities to net worth actually declined a bit between 1988 and 1998, to 16.7 percent from 16.9 percent, according to Federal Reserve figures assembled by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment firm based in London.
A negative savings rate is indeed a potential problem in the long run, and it is only one of several imbalances that have developed over the course of the long business expansion.
Should joblessness rise or the stock market head south, households might quickly find themselves on the financial precipice.
The same dynamic could apply to the rapidly growing trade deficit, which so far has been a symbol of the American economy's strength and its ability to absorb imports.
A downturn could expose the deficit as a weakness of serious proportions.
But even looking narrowly at the savings rate, the news there is not all bad.
While personal savings is in free fall, the overall national savings rate -- by far the more important economic indicator -- has been rising.
That is because the Government has become a ''saver'' in economic terms in the past few years as budget deficits have turned to surpluses and the Treasury has begun paying down the national debt.

Then there is the question of whether debt reduction is even the best way to use the fiscal windfall.
Mainstream economic thought says yes.
That position dovetails with the broad political consensus that a crucial component to shoring up the ailing entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, is getting the Government on sounder financial footing before the vast baby-boom generation retires.
BUT some conservatives say focusing on paying down the debt dilutes support for tax cuts, which they see as a far more potent way of stimulating additional growth.
Some liberals fear that concentrating on debt reduction will divert attention from needed investments in education, health care and poverty fighting, all issues essential to the country's long-term prospects.
Hanging over the debate is an even bigger question: Are the surpluses for real?
The answer is that nobody knows.
Today's fiscal optimism could prove equally transitory.
They have even been observed in recurring acts of infanticide.

Off Virginia, researchers found at least nine baby dolphins killed, their ribs broken, their skulls and vertebrae smashed.
One small body bore puncture marks matching the pattern of adult dolphin teeth.
''So finding evidence of violence is disturbing.''
More widely, scientists and Federal officials worry about dolphins' injuring or even killing humans, especially given the rise in watching, feeding and swimming programs.
''Wildlife can be dangerous,'' said Trevor R. Spradlin, a Federal dolphin expert.
''But people see marine mammals differently, particularly dolphins.
There's this misconception that they're friendly, that they're Flipper, that they want to play with people.''
Officials at the Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service, where Mr. Spradlin works, have begun an educational campaign that sends out brochures to marinas, schools and fairs in coastal areas where people and dolphins interact, urging caution and warning of peril.
''Dozens of bites have been reported,'' says one flier.
''And people have been pulled under water.
But she added, ''Just because dolphins have a smile doesn't mean they're nonaggressive.''
In the United States, dolphin commerce is loosely regulated, and many countries have no rules at all.
An American ban on feeding wild dolphins is routinely ignored by tour boats, which use food to lure dolphins nearby so people wearing masks and snorkels can swim among the creatures.
Revised rules are not expected until next year.

Many experts say tourist attractions will remain largely unfettered until a major accident occurs.
''They're big, wild animals,'' said Dr. Andrew J.
Read, a biologist at the Duke University Marine Laboratory who studies dolphin attacks.
''And people should respect them as such.''
Of course, dolphin savagery pales in comparison with the brutality of people, who have managed to kill millions of dolphins while fishing for tuna.
The dolphins, which breathe air, drown when large purse seine nets close over their heads.
Fishery reforms seek to limit the slaughter.
Closely related to whales, the 32 species that make up the dolphin family (Delphinidae in scientific nomenclature) include killer whales, which grow up to 30 feet long and are famous for their aggressive hunting pods.
But the rest are smaller.
The common dolphin is up to 7 feet long, and the bottlenose, up to 12 feet.
Many dolphins have a pronounced beak and all have a central dorsal fin and sharp teeth for feeding, mainly on squid and fish.
Significantly for humans, the mouths of many species turn upward in a perpetual grin.
As a result, the animals have long fascinated people.
Dolphins are highly social and appear to communicate among themselves with a wide range of clicks, whistles and beeps, though scientists who study them say they do not actually have a complex language.
Experts say dolphins are smarter than dogs and similar in intelligence to chimpanzees.
The new-age dolphin operations go much further.
In advertisements and tour promotions, they say dolphins are highly evolved spiritual beings.
The dolphin's mere glance is enlightening, they say.
''Dolphins reach deep into our souls, opening the door to our hearts,'' Marie-Helene Roussel said in an advertisement for her Delphines Center, which is on the Web at www.dolphinswim.com.
Anyone with $1,600 can join her late this month on a six-day sail around Bimini in the Bahamas for ''healing encounters'' with dolphins.
''This,'' he says on the Web site, ''is why I am working with people who are interested in exploring the potential of being transformed by love and higher intelligence of the dolphins.''

But now that image is being shattered as scientists document the grim slaughters.
They focused on harbor porpoises, marine mammals up to five feet long, that were turning up dead with a strange mix of injuries, including multiple skeletal fractures and damaged internal organs.

Suspects included boats and fishing nets.
''It was, 'Oh my God, the animals I've been studying for the last 10 years are killing these porpoises,' '' Dr. Wilson recalled.
''These findings challenge the benign image of bottlenose dolphins,'' they said.

Again, witnesses and videotape aided the hunt for evidence.
But the scientists speculated that the killers might be male dolphins trying to destroy rival offspring and free up females for mating.
Females, the researchers say, become attractive to males within a few days of losing a calf and apparently, when tending youngsters, stay sexually inactive for years.
Infanticide is common in nature.
Females kill their young when food is scarce and male lions and bears, for example, sometimes kill the young of a female taken as a new mate, giving them a reproductive and evolutionary edge.
The Scottish scientists published these new findings last year in Proceedings of the Royal Society, saying it was ''the first evidence of infanticide in cetaceans,'' the scientific grouping for whales, dolphins and porpoises.
They speculated that the assaults on porpoises might develop ''skills used in infanticidal attacks,'' or alternatively might stem from simple aggression or sexual frustration.
Meanwhile, an American group was independently making similar discoveries as dead porpoises and baby dolphins were washing up along the Virginia coast, many with the telltale internal wounds.
In addition to Ms. Barco, the Virginia group includes Dr. Dunn of the Armed Forces Institute and Dr. Ann Pabst and Dr. William McLellan of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.
Dr. Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert who is aiding the Virginia study, said evolutionary factors seemed a likely explanation for the infanticide.
The two kinds of marine mammals eat different fishes, he said, so food competition is unlikely.
''And there are very few instances when one mammal kills another when there is no risk of predation,'' Dr. Read added.

The emerging consensus is that wild dolphins can be cold-blooded killers.
Federal officials say dolphins pose little threat to people in captive swim programs, where the animals are usually well-trained and closely supervised by experts working in pools and enclosed bays.
During the past five years, the number of such businesses have risen to 18 from 4, said Dr. Barbara A. Kohn, a veterinarian at the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which oversees the field.
And more such tourist attractions are planned.
''That's pretty good,'' she said, adding that no serious injuries had been reported since then.
''So it continues to be fairly safe.''
The danger, experts agree, is when people swim with dolphins in the wild, an increasingly popular, unregulated sport.
For instance, Panama City, Fla., has a half-dozen boats offering such adventures.
''It's a time bomb waiting to go off,'' said Stephanie K. Dorezas, a spokeswomen for the National Marine Fisheries Service, which oversees dolphins in American coastal waters.
Federal officials say the recent scientific findings about wild dolphins and recent mishaps with the big animals are giving the Federal warning campaign a new degree of urgency.
''We're not trying to prevent people from going to the beach or going on dolphin watches,'' said Mr. Spradlin of the fisheries service.
''But they need to do it safely and responsibly.
It's like bird watchers or people on safari.
That same kind of caution and respect needs to be applied to sea life.''
And after five days of strong gains, it was not surprising to see some investors taking profits.
''We have run so far so fast we have to digest'' the gains, said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies & Company.
''But I wouldn't place too much importance in the price moves today because trading is so thin and the breadth is so lousy.''

A few companies, in fact, warned yesterday of lower profits, and their shares plunged.
On the strength of a late comeback, the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 52.24 points, or 0.47 of a percent, to a record 11,187.36, surpassing Friday's peak.
Caterpillar, up 2 13/16, to 62 1/8, and Allied Signal, up 2 1/8, to 63 7/8, placed second and third.
The Nasdaq market, which is dominated by high-technology stocks, gained a modest 0.23 percent in rising 6.26 points, to its new high of 2,743.04.
For example, declines outnumbered advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,691 to 1,307, and the Russell 2000 and the Standard & Poor's 600, which include smaller companies, each fell by nearly 1 percent.

One factor in the industrial commodity rebound, analysts say, is a revival in many of the world's economies from the global financial crisis that began in July 1997.

''Data for world economic growth suggest that rates are going to be higher than thought just a few months ago,'' said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch.
''In the first year of a recovery there is always a rise in demand for copper and other base metals.''
But some other factors have also pushed up commodity prices and will continue to put pressure on the market in the months ahead.
For example, the rally in copper in the last month has been abetted by a series of announcements about production cutbacks.
Asarco is reducing its copper mine output by 7 percent.
The Phelps Dodge Corporation is trimming production by 8 percent, while Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia will shut all its mines in the United States and reduce global production by 1.7 percent.
Some other influences will probably be temporary.
Copper jumped 3 percent on Wednesday because of speculation that Canadian workers would strike at Falconbridge's metallurgical division in Ontario.
For oil, which closed at $19.71 a barrel for August delivery yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the improved outlook can be directly linked to the success of the OPEC countries in maintaining production cutbacks.
(Analysts use different measures, but their compliance estimates were clustered around 90 percent.)
The price had fallen as low as $16.34 a barrel on June 1 after peaking at $18.98 on May 5.

Mr. Rothman predicts oil could end the year as high as $22 a barrel, although he added there could be a selloff between now and $22.
Frederick P. Leuffer, the senior energy analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, is speaking of a ''shockingly high'' $25 a barrel.
He estimates that if OPEC production remains steady at the 26 million barrels a day posted in May, inventories at the end of this year will be lower than at the end of 1996, when oil averaged $24.56 a barrel in the fourth quarter and finished the year just below $26.
The oil outlook has changed so quickly that Mr. Leuffer still has an official forecast of $19.50 a barrel in the second half of the year.
But, he said, ''I see a case developing for $25 oil or higher.''

This jump in oil and other industrial commodities is important for investors, even though it is not expected to produce any big jump in consumer prices or inflation over the longer term.
She now expects it to rise 2.4 percent from December to December, compared with a 1.6 percent increase last year.
That would put inflation back at its pace in 1997.
So it is in no sense an inflationary breakout.
But an outsized jump in just one month could be enough to force the Federal Reserve to raise its target for short-term interest rates another quarter of a percentage point.
Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, estimates that an average oil price of $21 a barrel this month would push gasoline prices to $1.28 a gallon.
And that would be enough to produce a five-tenths of one percentage point jump in the Consumer Price Index.
The consumer price figure for July will be reported Aug. 17, just a week before the next meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.
And Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at American Skandia Life Assurance in Shelton, Conn., said a move of that magnitude would force the Fed's hand.
''If the C.P.I.
jumps up again because of oil or because of other commodity price increases,'' he predicted, ''they will snug up again.''
In a reflection of the recent strong demand for these and other corporate bonds, which offer higher yields than the Treasury market, Government bond prices managed to remain relatively stable ahead of and during the record sale.
For the week, the Dow was up half a percent, hitting two new highs.
The S.& P. 500 rose nine-tenths of one percent, hitting two new highs, while the Nasdaq index was up 1.9 percent, setting three new highs.
The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6 percent from 5.99 percent Thursday.

The yield on the 30-year bond bounced around all day.
Both stock and bond investors will be keeping a close eye on the barometers of economic growth and inflation that the Government will release next week.
Any hint of rising inflation -- which is not expected -- or acceleration in the pace of economic growth could send stocks lower and interest rates higher.

Wednesday will bring the report on producer prices, which could give some signal if the recent rise in industrial commodity prices is affecting prices.
The Government's overall retail sales report for June will also be released Wednesday.
On Thursday, comes the Consumer Price Index for June and industrial production figures follows on Friday.
The University of Michigan survey on consumer sentiment will also be released Friday.
Speaking about the lackluster day in the bond market, Thomas Connor, the head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities, said, ''The bond market wasn't going to get up and go because we want to see the C.P.I.
number next week.''
Equity investors will also begin concentrating on corporate earnings reports as the second-quarter reporting season gears up.
It is the optimism about the outlook for earnings growth the rest of the year that is helping bolster stocks in the face of the quarter-point interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve at the end of last month and the possibility of another later in the year.
The two main compilers of corporate earnings forecasts are predicting a double-digit increase in the profits for the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's stock index.
The First Call Corporation's forecast is an increase of 11.2 percent, compared with the second quarter of 1998.
I.B.E.S.
International's prediction is 10 percent.
Since Fed policy makers raised their short-term interest rate target to 5 percent on June 30, investors have been debating whether another rate increase will be necessary to curb economic growth and keep inflation in check.

It is a world suddenly much larger for the 6-foot-8, 270-pound Brand.
At practice in Orlando, he is banging heads with such all-pro basketball players as Tim Duncan, Allan Houston, Gary Payton and Kevin Garnett.
''I'm trying not to be in awe,'' Brand said shortly before leaving.
''Everything came so fast, but I'm happy with my decision.''
But his admitted touch of awe is part of the realism that has taken the youth from Dunbar Heights this far, the first Westchester basketball player to be drafted No.

There is, however, no lack of confidence, even in the face of some draft experts questioning his No.

Nobody is expecting Brand totally to fill the biggest shoes in basketball history.
''Let's not talk of the next Michael Jordan but of the first Elton Brand.''
Before turning pro, Brand spoke with his good friend from Peekskill, Gov.
George E. Pataki, who told him to ''do what's best for your family.''
In the pros, Brand will change from the center position he manned for Duke to power forward for the Bulls.
He will continually go up against athletes taller than himself.

CHUCK SLATER
Digging in their heels, student protesters have decided once again to continue their strike at Mexico's huge national university, now in its 12th week, even though there are no longer any classes for them to strike against.
Since there is no summer session, no one will even try to give classes on the vast campus until mid-August.
But the strikers voted in a midnight session Saturday to maintain their shutdown even though the university is shutting down on its own.
Figures offered by the administration reveal the dimensions of the political confrontation at the university, the largest and once one of the most prestigious in Latin America.

Brigades of students still occupy the campus and guard barricades blocking the entrances.
Hundreds of strikers have been in residence on the campus, which has no dormitories, since the strike began.
But they immediately argued about procedure, with the administration calling for a closed negotiation and the students demanding to have the talks broadcast live on television.
While the Government has said it does not want to use force to evict the strikers, that option seemed to be an increasingly real possibility.

The strike began as a protest of a plan by the university president, Francisco Barnes de Castro, to charge a modest tuition for those who could afford it.
But he did not approach the strikers ahead of time to see how they would react.
The strike movement has become dominated by unbending leaders, some of whom have made careers of activism at the university and have shown no solid interest in settling with the administration.
While the public seems largely fed up with the strike, the protesters have picked up some outside support.

''I'm an old man and I've seen how this country runs,'' said Salvador Perez Gomez, a 68-year-old merchant who watched the march from the sidelines.
''We have to defend ourselves against this lousy Government and make sure they don't take away our children's right to an education.''
Money flowing out of those markets may well have sought safe haven in the United States Treasury market, they said.
Any improvement in interest rates, however, will be short-lived if reports on producer and consumer prices scheduled for this week are viewed unfavorably.
''The producer price data will be an important determinant in whether bond yields relax further or are pushed back up,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

''The concern is about earnings, and whether or not expectations, which are high, will be exceeded,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
''Many stocks, especially technology shares, have had huge moves in advance of these reports.
Unless a company really blows past the estimates, I expect we might see some profit taking when the numbers are announced.''

Mr. Galvin of Donaldson, Lufkin said that a report expected from Intel after the market closes today would say a great deal about how technology shares might fare in the second half of the year.
In addition to releasing financial data for the second quarter, Intel is expected to provide an outlook on the next six months.
''If Intel says Y2k is not an issue, that will clearly be a positive'' for the market, Mr. Galvin said, referring to concerns about the Year 2000 computer problems.
Profits rose 24 percent, to $268 million, or 50 cents a share in the quarter, surpassing both the 41 cents a share earned a year earlier and Wall Street expectations of 46 cents a share.
''I think Merrill is very well positioned for the global trends driving the industry today -- investment banking trends in Europe, strong trends in the U.S. that continue and Asia's longer-term prospects,'' said Richard Strauss, a securities industry analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company.
''But investors are also going to be keeping a close eye on its Internet strategy, and in the near term I think that expectation is just as important.''

The sharp reversal in Merrill's fortunes in the last year has produced a startling shift in how the once seemingly impregnable firm is perceived by many of its competitors and Wall Street.
The firm's finances were hammered by last year's economic chaos overseas, and it was slower than firms like the Charles Schwab Corporation to embrace the enthusiasm for trading that is sweeping the Internet.
While the stock market seemed to react mildly to Mr. Allison's departure, there is still concern about the lack of a clear successor to Mr. Komansky and how quickly the company will put its house in order.
''There's a sense around the Street that Merrill is adrift,'' said a senior executive at a rival firm.
''I still marvel at where this company was two years ago and where they are today.''
Merrill counters that it is focused on achieving its financial goals and has managers in place who are up to the task of running the firm in an era of brutal competition and rapid change in the financial services industry.
''We're very fortunate to have many talented executives in senior management and great bench strength,'' said Paul W. Critchlow, a Merrill spokesman.

Nonetheless, some analysts yesterday questioned how deep Merrill's managerial bench truly is.
Leading candidates to succeed Mr. Komansky include John L. Steffens, a vice chairman who heads on-line efforts and supervises the firm's army of retail brokers, and Jeffrey M. Peek, who oversees asset management.
Beyond that, some say, the candidates are slim.
Although attention has focused on Mr. Allison's shortcomings since his resignation was announced, Mr. Komansky has presided over a string of high-profile blunders or miscues in recent years.
Those include the aggressive marketing of complex financial products known as derivatives to Orange County, Calif., which helped send the county into bankruptcy; a big expansion into emerging markets, which created financial headaches last year, and an unusually deep involvement in the near collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund.

Merrill's earnings announcement yesterday disclosed smart gains in its overall asset-management business.
In the period, Merrill's net revenue, which includes interest income less interest expense, rose 12 percent, to a record $5.4 billion.
But underwriting fees in most debt categories declined in the second quarter, reflecting concerns about interest rates, the firm said.
But uncertainty about the firm will probably emerge starting in December, when Merrill is scheduled to introduce new Internet-related products and trading accounts.
''People are worried about the fourth quarter, when on-line trading and the retail products that come along with it will be rolled out,'' said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Other analysts shared Ms. Krawcheck's interest in how Merrill's Internet strategy will be deployed.
''There is an inherent conflict with their brokers, which may be compounded by the fact that Launny Steffens will be running both the retail and Internet sides of the business,'' Ms. Solotar said.
''I am hopeful management realizes it needs a cohesive Internet strategy and has a window of five months to put it together.''
There are a number of disturbing economic fundamentals behind the turbulence in the Buenos Aires exchange, which has sent shudders through emerging markets from Brazil to Poland.
They include a growing Government deficit, a failing public pension agency, falling exports and climbing unemployment.
Moreover, President Carlos Saul Menem is looking like an increasingly weak lame duck, especially after capitulating to truck drivers on strike last week demanding an easing of vehicle taxes.

But Mr. Duhalde's comment on debt relief and the Pope was only the latest in a series of campaign statements by Mr. Duhalde and his opponent, the Mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la Rua, that have irked Argentine business executives as well as Government economists.
The winner of the October election is to take power in December.
At a June 25 news conference, Mr. Duhalde said ''debt payments are bleeding us.''
He added, that with ''current levels of debt servicing there will be no possibility of recovery for our country.''
A week later Mr. De la Rua, who has a small lead in the polls, tried to calm investors at a conference for Argentine bankers by pledging that he would not take Argentina off its free-market path or touch the Government policy of pegging the value of the peso to the dollar.

''We're not going to do anything crazy,'' he said, adding that he did not intend to seek a debt pardon nor even a year's grace.
''The power of the state should not be in the hands of investors,'' he said, adding: ''We defend our interests.
The people at the stock exchange defend investors; we defend the debtors.''
But while Wall Street analysts have not liked the increasingly leftist tone of the political campaign, few say they believe that a future Argentine Government will significantly shift economic policy.
Wall Street and Argentine analysts say the current campaign reminds them of President Menem's statements during the 1989 campaign in which he promised to initiate a costly Government employment program and suggested that Argentina should default on its debt.
The moves ended a long period of hyperinflation and led to years of rising Argentine stock prices.
''The candidates' comments are political posturing and should not be taken seriously,'' said Jorge O. Mariscal, Goldman, Sachs & Company's chief investment strategist for Latin America.
''If Argentina were not in the shape it is, they would not matter.
Unfortunately Argentina is not in good shape today.''
Fears of rising interest rates in the United States were also hurting stock prices, according to the report.

Up until now, the campaign has been a lackluster affair with neither candidate offering anything even approaching a coherent economic plan.
But on Tuesday, Mr. De la Rua said he could not promise that he would cut taxes.
In response, Mr. Duhalde said today that he would seek to cut the 21 percent value added tax, though he would not specify by how much.
On the whole, Americans tend to be sympathetic to wildlife.
They have supported the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone National Park, for example, as well as efforts by environmental groups and the Federal Government to protect other endangered species.
But the issue gets more complicated when animals camp on their doorsteps.
Suburban sprawl has created competition for space between humans and wildlife, and while nobody much likes it when deer and waterfowl are edged out of their natural habitat, there are times when the creatures rebound in such numbers that they compromise the quality of community life.
Such is the case with Canada geese in Kent, N.Y., a town that encompasses Lake Carmel in Putnam County.
As described in a recent Times article, Kent has decided that the geese are winning, and has launched a program to round them up and process them as meals for the needy.
Other programs of this kind have failed, most recently in Clarkstown, N.Y., where a similar plan crumbled after protests from animal rights activists.
But with an exploding goose population, Kent officials are standing firm against the rights activists.
Frustrated communities have dubbed Canada geese ''feathered rats.''
They soil parks and raise fears of disease when their waste fouls reservoirs and recreational waters.
The manicured lawns of suburbia provide an Eden for these birds.
Communities like Kent are so appealing that geese often forgo the migratory trip to North Carolina and settle in as year-round squatters, reproducing in great numbers.
Kent's officials have no intention of eradicating all the geese.
Their aim, rather, is to create a smaller, sustainable population on Lake Carmel over several years.
Their program seems a sensible compromise between the needs of nature and, in this case, the rather more urgent needs of the community.
The fact that the doomed geese will be used for food helps soothe the conscience.
The Bears -- in violet shirts, white pants and white and violet caps -- took the field for the first time to the pulsing beat of rock music, ready to face the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds.

In the stands, spectators' expectations varied.
Larry Goldman, the president of the nearby New Jersey Performing Arts Center, whose opening 18 months ago heralded an important beginning to the city's revitalization, said that ''arts and sports, sports and arts would prove to be the leading edge of change in urban areas.''
Isaias Vasquez, 10, attending his first pro baseball game, was in search of memories.
Looking around the stadium and pronouncing it ''beautiful,'' he said, ''I just want to get hit by a ball.''
Two years ago, just two weeks before city and county officials were to break ground on county parkland about a mile away, neighborhood opponents of the plan obtained landmarks designation for the park and blocked construction.

Now we have a waiting list for everything, including promotions for our 36 home games.''
Today, still looking much like a construction site with trailers clogging dusty flats, and some cement walkways cordoned off and still drying, the stadium was pronounced ''fan ready'' by Mr. Levy.
Members of the six-team, independent Atlantic League, the Newark Bears are part of a boom in minor-league baseball that experts say is being fed by the same promise of economic development that comes with having a major league team and stadium.
There are five independent leagues, unaffiliated with major-league teams or their farm systems, with 48 teams.
Alan Simpson, editor of Baseball Today, the trade publication that focuses on minor-league baseball, said the teams of the Atlantic League are an aggressive bunch who are paying more than some other leagues in an effort to get good players and who seem to have a flair for the marketing necessary to build fan interest and profits.

Team manager Tom O'Malley said that ''feeling like nomads'' may have accounted for the dismal record.
But tonight, the Bears gave the fans a thriller, winning 9-8 in 10 innings.
To the Editor:

''Despite the Fears, Inflation Still Refuses to Materialize,'' (Economic View, June 20) skillfully explained the evidence that there are virtually no indications of actual or incipient inflation in our economy today -- and little reason for the Federal Reserve to want to make restrictive moves in monetary policy.
What remains a mystery is the basis for the Fed's compulsion to raise rates last month, even though its chairman, Alan Greenspan, had been acknowledging that we are in the midst of an extraordinary technology boom that is lowering costs and expanding productive capacity at rates never seen before.
The answer, I believe, is that the Fed has no economic model to fit the present environment of technology-driven growth.
The Fed, unable to discard its obsolete thinking about economic expansion, remains dependent on historical economic data that no longer apply to our economy.
The Fed, for example, has dwelled on the fact that labor markets are too tight, while the reality is that scarce labor is a strong incentive for companies to innovate rapidly and invest in new technology.
The inflation fears seem to be unaffected by the tight rein on aggregate demand imposed by a large and growing Federal budget surplus.
The Fed also seems oblivious to the fact that stock market gains tend to be self-limiting and cannot fuel increased consumer spending for very long.
Worst of all, the Fed shows no signs of recognizing that its worries about inflation for several years now have been terribly wrong.
The country is entitled to more accountability than it is now getting from the Fed.

In addition, interest rates in Europe have recently been rising.
While interest rates are still higher in the United States, the narrowing of the gap increases the euro's attractiveness to investors.
And in recent comments, leaders of the European Central Bank have hinted that their next move will be to raise interest rates.
But it will take further confirmation that the economies of Germany and other European nations are turning around before many analysts will be ready to declare that the euro can climb back to its January level of $1.17, and higher.
But he has not changed his long-term outlook.
In fact, BankBoston is still predicting that the euro will drop below $1.00 by the end of the year.

But analysts do not think that the intervention by the Bank of Japan alone can keep the yen from getting stronger.
Yesterday's yen selling was the sixth time that Japan has intervened since June 10, when the yen was 118.96 to the dollar, according to Bloomberg News.
''This slows down the recovery of the yen against the dollar,'' said Karen E. Parker, currency strategist at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
She predicts that the yen will rally to a range of 110 to 115 to the dollar in the next 6 to 12 months.
It is not unusual for one central bank to intervene in the currency markets on behalf of another central bank, and usually such a move does not signal any policy change by the central bank that is asked to intervene.
Then, the Fed joined the Japanese by intervening to support the yen when it was falling sharply, threatening to worsen a global economic crisis.
Nassau's financial predicament -- consisting of the budget deficit and a long-term bond rating just above junk -- has reached the point where the county must borrow $80 million against future sales-tax receipts to meet its expenses for July or it will show a negative fund balance of $34 million, according to the county's underwriters.
Today, Standard & Poor's also reduced a debt rating, moving the county's so-called revenue anticipation notes to SP-2, the next-to-lowest category.
There remains the possibility that the rating could drop even further, to below-investment-grade level, said Richard Marino, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
Nassau now plans to sell $80 million in notes on Thursday or Friday, but it intends to offer investors the added assurance of a bank's letter of credit.
It will come at a cost; one of the county's underwriters estimated that it would add about half a percentage point to the loan's interest rate.
Short-term borrowing, meanwhile, seems to be spreading across Nassau like a virus.
For the first time, a number of charitable agencies that are under contract to the county to provide for its neediest citizens have been forced to seek their own costly loans to pay current salaries and expenses.
They are bracing to lay off workers or shut down programs if they cannot borrow quickly enough.
The agency is owed $465,000 dating back to March.
He lamented having to pay the interest on that money: ''This is where we have to use private dollars?''

In Garden City, the Coalition on Child Abuse and Neglect, another child welfare group, has not been paid since January, said Cynthia Cavallo, its executive director.
The group is owed $154,000 out of an annual budget of $800,000.
''To get through the next four to six weeks, we need $70,000.''
Jack O'Connell, executive director of the Health and Welfare Council of Long Island, said dozens of the 300 organizations he represents had reported being increasingly squeezed by delays in payments from Nassau.
''We have 14 agencies coming here to my office tomorrow to talk about the county contracting problem,'' he said.
''And it isn't all necessarily attributed to the same problem.''
One reason, Mr. O'Connell said, is that county departments are taking much longer to negotiate annual renewal contracts, meaning that charitable groups have to work for months into the year until they can submit vouchers for reimbursement.

But Mr. Parola, who called the delays ''an ongoing disgrace,'' said his office routinely processes payments in fewer than 30 days.
''The delay is in the departments,'' he said, shifting blame back to Mr. Gulotta.
All of which is no consolation to such groups as the Long Island Council of Churches, which is owed $150,000 dating back to December.
Thomas W. Goodhue, executive director of the council.
''One person says they changed their computer system.
Then there are new voucher numbers.
Then someone hasn't signed off on the vouchers.
Then it's, 'We haven't got the vouchers yet.'
Then they'll say they need to recompute some numbers.''
''We're borrowing $25,000 at 11 percent,'' he said -- more than twice the county's short-term borrowing rate -- ''and we're trying to borrow another $50,000 at 9 percent.
Because who knows when we'll be paid the rest of what the county owes us.''
Even with those loans, Mr. Goodhue said, he may have to furlough chaplains at the county hospital and nursing home.
''That $14,000 will be just enough for us to make payroll this time,'' he said.
The apparent reason for the change is that counting tax cuts, gross Government debt can be expected to rise slightly over the next 10 years because of transfers between Government accounts.
That would mean tax cuts could not go into effect.
But total interest payments are projected to fall because the Congressional Budget Office is forecasting lower interest rates.
Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now an economist at the Brookings Institution and who opposes tax cuts, said, ''It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.''
But the experts can take solace in one point: Hardly anyone in Congress thinks the contrivance will become law.
A top staff member on the Senate Finance Committee said there was no chance this would become part of a companion bill that will go before the Senate as early as next week.

''I didn't want to be part of killing a significant tax bill,'' said Representative Marge Roukema of New Jersey, adding that she could not have voted for the bill without the trigger mechanism.

What if the bill comes back from the conference with the Senate without the mechanism?
''We'll have to face that when we come to it,'' Ms. Roukema replied.
Another moderate, Representative Nick Smith of Michigan, who was one of the main authors of the compromise, said, ''If this doesn't come back from conference, 40 Republicans will have to be convinced that our conferees really tried and couldn't do it.
And even then some of us will be quite wary.''
Here is how the mechanism would work: Each July, the budget office would determine whether total Government interest payments, to the public and to Government trust funds, were lower in the previous 12 months than they had been in the 12-month period before that.
Otherwise, the tax cut would be postponed for a year.
Then it would be subject to the same test of lower interest payments.
Under the bill, tax rates would fall by one percentage point in 2003 and continue to fall in annual increments until the reduction reached 10 percentage points in 2009.
The other tax cuts in the bill, like the reduction in capital gains rates and the abolition of inheritance taxes, would not be affected.
The worst problem cited by the policy experts is that interest payments, which depend not only on the size of the debt but also the level of interest rates, are not always a good measure of debt reduction.
Another problem is that if interest payments rise sharply from one year to the next and then fall slightly in the following year, a tax reduction would be allowed even though more interest was paid in the third year than in the first.
The S.& P. 500 fell 4.4 percent for the week, its worst performance since the week ended Sept. 4, on concern that interest rates are headed higher.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said Thursday that the central bank might raise borrowing costs to head off inflation.
The concern over interest rates overshadowed corporate profits that are growing at the fastest rate since the third quarter of 1997.

But Thomas M. McManus, equity portfolio strategist at Banc of America Securities, thinks this earnings run could last a long, long time, and he took some time last week to explain why.
Here are some excerpts:

Q.
You are of the view that this period of strong earnings growth can continue for the indefinite future.
Why?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A. I sense a significant underlying shift in the ability of American companies to grow earnings.
For many, the roots are in consolidation, which has been important in terms of combining two attractive businesses, maintaining the same amount of revenues but with a much smaller cost base.
That doesn't happen instantly, but over a couple of years.
Even without consolidation, companies have continued to restructure, coming up with a different mix of businesses that are growing faster, are less cyclical and in areas that are attractively positioned.
The best example here is General Electric, which has been restructuring its businesses for 20 years.
Q.
So what does this lead you to conclude?
A.
That there is a higher secular growth rate for S.& P. earnings than most are willing to concede.
And the cyclical rebound off of the decline in earnings last year has occurred sooner and been more robust than anyone had forecast.
Q.
What is your current earnings forecast?
A.
And I think we are going to raise estimates for this year and 2000 again.

Q.
What do you say to those who say the S.& P. is overvalued at these levels?
A. I think anyone who is saying the market is overvalued this year, be it the Fed or stock market strategists, is not taking into account that the underlying business mix has improved at least as much as General Electric has improved because of a very rapid turnover of components in the index.
It now has less cyclicality and greater sustainability than it did in the past and deserves to trade at a higher P/E multiple relative to any interest rate you might choose or any competing market benchmark around the world.
Also, people should be focusing on free cash flows, not earnings.
Net income is only the first approximation of profitability.
The real value to investors is the amount of cash a company can take out and still be left with a business that is just as good as it was before.
Companies like Microsoft and Intel are like that, and that is one reason they trade at such high multiples to net income.
Q.
There are plenty of folks who are worried about the effect that Year 2000 computer problems will have on the economy and earnings.
Do you share those concerns?
A.
It is my view that profits are actually being negatively impacted right now.
It is my hunch that is their Y2K compliance system.
Q.
Which companies or groups of companies are likely to enjoy the most rapid earnings growth over the next year or so?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A.
We could see continued improvement in a whole host of companies.
Right now, the market is looking for trends of earnings repair, or a bounce off the dip we saw last year.
Individual companies we like include Ethan Allen, the furniture manufacturer and retailer, which experienced a significant hit last year.
We also like W. W. Granger, which is investing heavily in its Internet presence.
We are also very attracted to the semiconductor capital equipment sector, and really like Novellus in that area.
And we like technology generally.
The passage should have read: ''We are also very attracted to the semiconductor capital equipment sector, and really like Novellus in that area.
And we like technology generally.''
Despite the extended decline, the Nasdaq composite is still up more than 19 percent this year.
''The Nasdaq is correcting for the excesses it recorded over the past month,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
''All in all, the market is in pretty good shape, but it needs to take a pause.''
Peter J. Canelo, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, suggested that technology stocks might fall out of favor for a while.
''It has been my thesis that good second-quarter earnings would help technology stocks, but that after those numbers were reported worries about Y2K and the like would cause the market to rotate back to areas like energy, cyclical and financial services stocks,'' he said.

He added, ''The market needs a shift in leadership to keep advancing, and I think that will happen.''

''We are going to see this sort of trading pattern,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
''I think a lot of portfolio managers are taking profits and putting on longer-term hedges, particularly in technology stocks, which despite their terrific long-term prospects are very pricey right now.''
''The risk-reward status of the S.& P. 500 at levels above 1,300 will remain poor for most of the second half,'' Ms. Callies wrote.
''Investors should not chase rallies but should use trading bounces to rebalance portfolios and raise modest amounts of cash.''
High valuations and worries that the Federal Reserve Board might raise interest rates again took a toll on technology stocks.

Re ''Seeking Common Ground on Federal Tax Cut'' (news article, July 25):

Now is not the time for a tax cut.
A tax cut will stimulate the economy further, prompting the Federal Reserve to compensate with a larger interest-rate increase.
At some future point when the economy needs a boost a tax cut would be a useful tool.
Why squander it now?
In the meantime, there's a little matter of the national debt.
When do Republicans figure the debt should be paid off?
When we're in a recession?

Douglas, Alaska, July 25, 1999
''The stock market is waiting for some heavy-duty data,'' said Christine A. Callies, chief investment strategist at CS First Boston, mainly to examine them for any signs of inflation that might persuade Fed policy makers to raise short-term interest rates again.
Consequently, market operators are now awaiting today's Labor Department survey of employment costs and the Commerce Department's first estimate of gross domestic product, both covering the quarter ended June 30.
''The market is sort of slip-sliding around here'' except for a ''relief'' rally in high technology, said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers.

Senate Votes to Cut Taxes By $792 Billion in 10 Years

The Senate voted to cut taxes by $792 billion over the next 10 years, moving the Republican-controlled Congress toward a showdown with President Clinton over how the nation can best use trillions of dollars in projected Federal budget surpluses.
The bill would cut personal income taxes by reducing the lowest tax rate starting in 2001.
It would give a tax break to many married couples, expand the Individual Retirement Account program, create a deduction for some health insurance costs and reduce the inheritance tax on large estates.

But, as Fenby points out in his first chapter, ''Something Special,'' the French have become obsessed with l'exception francaise.
''France occupies an exclusive place in the world, and could accept nothing less,'' he writes.
''It is, its President declares, a beacon for the human race.
The nation and its people may be loved or hated, but they can never be ignored.''
Among a veritable potpourri of facts, anecdotes and eccentricities that prove the point, Fenby offers one delightful illustration of French scorn for Anglo-Saxon pragmatism.
''It will work in practice, yes,'' a French diplomat is said to have remarked.
''But will it work

in theory?''
This is a chapter that any newcomer to France is well advised to memorize: it is food for many a lively dinner table conversation.
Indeed, the entire book serves as a valuable introduction to contemporary France.
Fenby stops and looks at every corner of French society, contrasting how it was with what it has become; with an occasional glance back, he also tracks the swings of French politics since Charles de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic in 1959.
One theme runs through his story: ''The conservative strain in French life has always been far stronger than the revolutionary images suggest.''
Change has come, but it has rarely been welcomed.
In a chapter called ''Vanishing Madeleines,'' Fenby notes that the classic images of France -- beret, baguette, dark cigarettes, corner cafe, the accordion, garlic and the like -- have all lost ground in daily life: only three beret factories survive, most baguettes are made with frozen preconstituted dough, foreign cigarette brands account for almost half of total sales, cafes are closing at an alarming rate, only Romanian Gypsies now seem to play accordions and even garlic consumption is falling.

Fast food is by now well entrenched and, worse, embraced by many French as a useful short cut in rushed urban schedules.
Business lunches and summer vacations are shrinking.
French men may still have wandering eyes, but they have less time for mistresses.
The convenience -- and lower prices -- of supermarkets have put many shopkeepers out of business in cities and, even more alarmingly, in villages, which are dying across France (albeit occasionally revived in a different form as summer havens for Parisians and northern Europeans).
The countryside, after all, is the repository of French nostalgia.
Thus, rare is the city dweller who does not have a parent or grandparent born in some distant pays.
Even now, Fenby notes, ''French townspeople have more country homes than any other Europeans.''
And it is the countryside that provides the food and wines that remain so central to France's image of itself.
''Rural France,'' Fenby says, ''is a state of mind.''
Yet the reality is painful.
As agriculture has modernized, small farms have closed and villages have been abandoned.
Returning one August to a village that had known better times, Fenby recalls: ''That used to be the busiest time of the year.
The pace quickens, though, when the author turns to the grim suburbs, or banlieues, of major cities, suburbs that have been transformed over the past 25 years by Arab and African immigration.
The first generation of immigrants consisted in the main of solitary men with jobs.
And now their children are rapidly forming an underclass living in project housing, unemployed, surrounded by drugs and violence.
Fenby recounts familiar stories of gang warfare, race riots and ritual car burnings, but he also visits several banlieues and is left alarmed by the anger and despair he encounters.
And, he notes, ''Each banlieue riot involving young immigrants sends more votes to the far right.''
When it comes to pointing fingers, however, Fenby does not hesitate.
Whether it is France's failure to integrate immigrants and the commensurate rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right National Front, whether it is the growth of unemployment to a constant 11 percent of the work force, whether it is the spate of corruption scandals in public life, he sees the country's political elite as ultimately responsible.
Today a few thousand politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, many of them graduates of the exclusive ecole Nationale d'Administration, run France and, in Fenby's view, all too often they run it for themselves.
And the French are beginning to notice.
NARROWING his target, Fenby then looks at how three men exercised the monarchical powers of the French presidency over the past 25 years.
He is not impressed.
But if he portrays Valery Giscard d'Estaing (1974-81) as a vainglorious snob and Jacques Chirac (1995 to the present) as something of a buffoon, he believes Fran-->ois Mitterrand (1981-95) was positively dangerous -- devious and unprincipled.
''In opposition, his amorality could be excused as necessary in the pursuit of power,'' Fenby writes.
Given what the future keeps bringing them, the French are understandably fearful of still more future.
However, given their continued expectation that the state solve their problems, Fenby sees no alternative to looking again to the elite to find answers.
He points the way: it must lead a nonviolent revolution, ''which embraces the modern world while preserving the best of the past.''
He even harbors some hope that the current ''cohabitation'' between the conservative Chirac and his Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, will produce ''a different kind of politics, which would be much less ideological, less a prisoner of the state, more open-minded -- and, dare one hope, less personalized.''
Yet he does not sound too sure.
He demonstrates that he cares passionately for France, but he ends his book with France still ''on the brink.''
Ever since last fall, when Danka's board changed the company's management, plucking Mr. Switzer from Fruit of the Loom and selecting Brian L. Merriman from Toshiba as president, the two men have been cutting, chopping, negotiating and otherwise wrenching Danka back from the brink of bankruptcy.

They talked the company's banks, which were poised to call in loans, into extending more credit.
They got the Xerox Corporation to buy back a lackluster business for servicing older, scattered Xerox machines.
Danka used to have 48 warehouses; it now has 3.
It eliminated 1,400 jobs, reducing the work force to 17,000, and integrated data systems.
Now, they are phasing out products from all but three vendors: Canon, Toshiba and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen A.G.
The German company bought Kodak's copier business in March, giving it ownership of the Digisource 9110, the only copier fast enough to rival Xerox's Docutech line.
Danka's operating expenses are still high, as are the double-digit interest rates it is paying on its $1.1 billion debt.
A deal to sell its international operations to Schroder Ventures, a British holding company, fell through in June, depriving Danka of cash it needs to service debt.
Its sales remain sluggish.
And competition keeps getting fiercer as more companies introduce digital copiers.
''We may see more pricing pressures on everyone in the next 12 to 18 months,'' warned Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
Still, Danka no longer seems headed for extinction.
''We've seen the last really horrendous quarter,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Securities Research.
Investors are coming around.
''I bought this stock at $4, and I expect to make a lot of money on it,'' said Frank G. Cannata, who edits a copier-industry newsletter and who said he expects Danka A.D.R.
's to top $15 in a year.
''They've made progress in every critical area.''
To fully understand the magnitude of Danka's turnaround, one has to first understand the depths to which the company had sunk.

Danka, which was formed in 1977, immediately began gobbling up other dealers.
It, in turn, was purchased by a British holding company in 1986, and Danka's shares began trading in London that year.
The A.D.R.
's began trading on Nasdaq in 1992.
By last year Danka was an international giant, handling more than 40 copiers from six manufacturers, each with hefty costs for training and spare-parts inventories.
If a large customer wanted to install one type of equipment in all its branches, Danka could not guarantee service at every location.
''Frustrations were surfacing even as Xerox was introducing its first digital products in 1997.''

In desperation, Mr. Switzer and Mr. Merriman reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that Danka might file for bankruptcy.
Danka has since been helped by fortuitous timing.
Both Canon and Toshiba came out with full lines of digital copiers, helping Danka flesh out its scrawny digital product line.
And Danka negotiated a deal with Heidelberger for distributing the Digisource that does not involve high fixed prices or promises to take Heidelberger's entire output.
While the distribution contract is not exclusive, Danka's participation in Digisource's development -- and its relationships with Kodak's customers -- gives it a head start in selling and servicing the machine.

Still, Danka's path to growth remains obstacle-strewn.
Since it has stopped servicing Xerox's older machines, it has lost an invaluable foot in the door to some clients of Xerox, which uses neither Danka nor the country's largest distributor, Ikon Office Solutions.
Meanwhile, I.B.M.
has announced its own high-speed copier.
And many of the Kodak salespeople who left Danka have customer relationships they can build on for rival distributors.
Mr. Merriman has been reorganizing Danka's sales force, putting former Kodak people in charge of many major accounts and leaving most of the aggressive selling to the Danka sales force.
Still, several analysts say that sales is Danka's weak link.
''I'm not sure that Danka has the experienced personnel to sell high-speed digital devices,'' said Edward Lee, a senior analyst at Lyra Research.
Indeed, Danka's revival has not prompted its competitors or suppliers to shift strategies.
''We're targeting more than 200 resellers for our products, and no change in Danka's prospects will have an impact on our marketing plans,'' said a spokesman for the Hewlett-Packard Company, which is pushing a line of hybrid printer-copiers called mopiers, that it had once planned to distribute through Danka.
And Canon is trying to bring its direct sales up to 45 percent of total revenue from 35 percent now.
The company also stopped granting any independent distributors exclusive territories.
That can help Danka sell equipment and service packages to large customers -- but it can help Ikon do so as well.
''Danka has a lot of potential to grow with us, but Ikon is still a bigger channel for us,'' said Tod D. Pike, senior vice president for Canon USA's imaging systems group.
Ikon also spent much of this year paring vendors and shoring up a sagging bottom line, and it has said it will concentrate on pumping up sales of a few big vendors -- including Canon -- when its 2000 fiscal year starts in October.
''Narrowing down vendors is a smart move for anyone,'' said Dennis Le Strange, senior vice president for Ikon North America, ''but we remain focused on our own plans.''
Indeed, many of Danka's competitors hope the company makes it.
They see a revived Danka as an ally in the battle to prevent Xerox, which declined to comment for this article, from getting the same hammerlock on the digital copier market that it has enjoyed in analog copiers.

''I'll root for any company that can persuade customers to buy from someone other than the big X,'' said Jim Ivy, chief executive of the Savin Corporation, a copier manufacturer owned by Ricoh.
''If Danka grows, it'll be more effective in competing with Xerox, and anyone who hurts Xerox is good in my books.''
The index is generally considered to be the best measure of what's happening to overall compensation, which encompasses both wages and health benefits and pensions.

So the markets' anxiety may have been understandable.
First, as anyone who works with economic statistics knows, a single quarter's estimate does not a trend make.
Third and most important, so long as worker productivity continues to rise at about 2 percent a year, American companies can afford to pay their workers 3.5 to 4 percent more per year without increasing their prices faster than the current inflation rate of about 2 percent.

Why, then, are financial markets so skittish?
There are several factors at work that have nothing to do with American workers' pay.
The global economy is heating up as Europe, Japan and several emerging markets recover from recessions.
This is causing commodity prices to rebound, increasing the prices of things like energy, which are also important ingredients of production costs.
In addition, greater competition for capital in the rest of the world is curbing foreign appetite for American financial assets, driving the dollar's value down in recent weeks.
This is a source of anxiety because the dollar's appreciation has shaved at least half a percent off our annual inflation rate during the last few years.
In short, there is little evidence that labor costs are rising, despite tight labor markets, but there is mounting evidence that other factors have again shifted the balance of risks facing the American economy toward inflation.
Moreover, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has signaled that the Fed is poised to raise short-term interest rates again this year if necessary to pre-empt an increase in inflationary pressure.
This is hardly a soothing message for equity markets, which according to standard models are somewhat overvalued and therefore vulnerable to correction.
Still, all this skittishness should not obscure the fact that tight labor markets have been a real boon for the American economy.
After years of stagnation, wages and family incomes for the majority of Americans are finally growing; after decades of widening, income inequality is finally narrowing, and unemployment rates for members of racial minorities and high-school dropouts have hit record lows.
The challenge for Washington in the coming months will be how to navigate this expansion along a road marred by potholes of inflationary risk.
The good news is that with inflation and interest rates still low, productivity growth strong and technological change fueling investment in new production capacity, there is no need for the Fed to slam on the brakes.
A little judicious slowing at the right time -- that is, a small adjustment or two in rates if conditions warrant -- should do the trick, so long as those nervous financial markets do not cause us to lose sight of the road.
''This is not just an isolated day,'' said Bob Gasser, head of United States equity trading at J. P. Morgan Securities.
''It is a lot tougher for the market to deal with rising interest rates than with good corporate earnings.''

Mr. Gasser and other analysts said the market was likely to remain in a highly unsettled state until at least Friday, when July employment data are scheduled to be released.
The Federal Reserve Board, which meets Aug. 24 to debate whether it should raise short-term interest rates, is likely to pay close attention to that report.
The stock has lost nearly half its market value since early April.

Stocks of Internet brokerage firms, which have also been beaten up recently, were battered again after Bill Burnham, an Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, issued a report saying the companies might see their first-ever decline in trading volume, in the third quarter, because of weakness in the Internet stocks their companies favor.
''To see growth in negative territory is significant, but not earth shattering,'' Mr. Burnham said.

America Online, the world's largest Internet service, continued its slump, with the stock falling for the fourth session, shedding 4 1/16, to 88 13/16.
Since April 6, when it peaked at 175 1/2, the stock has fallen nearly 50 percent.
''The good news from this summer's selling of Internet shares is that the bears will be hard pressed to still call this a bubble market,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
''At this point, the easy money appears to have been made in Internet stocks.''
Qualcomm was the biggest loser on the Nasdaq, falling 12 1/2, to 140.
The Nasdaq index fell 47.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 2,540.00, and is now down 11.3 percent from its high of 2,864.48 on July 16.
This means the market is experiencing a correction, which Wall Street defines as any decline of more than 10 percent; a drop of 20 percent is considered a bear market.
''People seem to have gotten scared and tired'' in recent weeks, said George Cohen, a portfolio manager at Cohen, Klingenstein & Marks.

Also referring to the Internet sector, Scott Marcouiller, an analyst at A. G. Edwards, said: ''They're not giving any sign of bottoming yet.
Our recommendation is to avoid them.''

''People have lost huge sums.''
Bucking the trend were some companies whose products are considered to be tied closely to the economy.
Despite the widespread distress elsewhere in the sector, an initial public offering by Internet Initiative Japan, which connects Japanese companies and consumers to the Internet, met an enthusiastic reception.
But at least two more initial public offerings were withdrawn, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data: Reynard Motorsport and Country Maid Financial.
No African nation is as sadly recidivist as Angola.
Agreements to end the power struggle between the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi and the Government have been within reach in 1975, 1991 and 1994, but never successfully grasped.
What's the problem?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Most African and Western governments blame Mr. Savimbi, whose ambition is said to impede any deal that does not give him the presidency.
His refusal to accept the outcome of the 1992 election and his return to armed struggle is a case in point.
The rebels only went through the motions of carrying out a 1994 power-sharing arrangement in which they would join the government as a junior partner.
Today, Mr. Savimbi's forces have the military initiative in much of the country and are pushing civilians they cannot feed into the Government-controlled cities, deliberately creating conditions for a popular explosion.
Using guerrilla logic mastered during 35 years in the bush, Mr. Savimbi aims to isolate the regime in the cities, cut power and water supplies and sow panic.
The United States and other countries are now trying to isolate, punish and coerce the rebels while stepping up support for the Government in Luanda.
The Security Council is trying to cut off Mr. Savimbi's access to the billions in diamond revenue that has helped him to sustain a war against an oil-rich Government.

But this approach is no more likely to bring peace to Angola than previous attempts.
Despite massive military spending and imports of new artillery and aircraft, Angola's top soldiers have few illusions about winning: Angola is too big, the Unita guerrillas have too many advantages and are too skillful for that.
The military's game is a long one, involving defense, containment and attrition.
Over time, it hopes to wear the rebels down, raise their costs and bleed their forces, while squeezing their ability to sustain arms imports.
It is the strategy of comfortable incumbents who know their limits and believe they can deny Mr. Savimbi victory.
On Unita's side, meanwhile, the war itself represents a tolerable definition of survival, and survival is a form of victory.
The rebel group obtains external supplies through various networks and channels that flourish in a world of weak, destabilized states and porous borders.
Ukrainians, South Africans, Ugandans and Zambians among many others are mentioned as tacit or active partners.
African airspace and ports are not difficult to move through.
Moreover, Unita has always captured a big portion of its supplies from the Government itself.
Opportunists with a Leninist sense of power are in charge on both sides in Angola.
Neither places a high priority on peace or people.
Barring victory, both prefer war over peace.
But for the people of Angola the permanent war is intolerable.
In some war zones, land mines are being planted faster than crops.
The World Food Program regularly revises upward its estimates of emergency food requirements but has received less than 40 percent of what it needs.
Once-eradicated diseases like polio are thriving once again in Angola's inaccessible areas.
Infant and child mortality rates are rising to appalling levels.
Perhaps, instead of debating which political bed to jump into tomorrow, the United States would be better advised to engage not only with the Government but also with Angola's fragile civil society institutions, the churches, the humanitarian agencies and those ''autonomous'' leaders who are now speaking out against the unconscionable behavior of incumbent elites.
Kofi Annan is right to call for the real friends of Angola to engage in the search for peace, as he did last week.
But one wonders if this is best done by having American military and diplomatic resources placed at the disposal of the recognized but unaccountable Government of Angola.
We need a broader regional effort: the conflicts in Congo and Angola have fed off each other and continue to do so.
The drama in Central Africa requires more than picking a favored side.
It demands a coherent strategy building on the recent Congo pact to create a fresh momentum for peace.

Standoff Over Bank of Japan Eases

Japan's Liberal Democratic Party said it would not press the Bank of Japan to buy Government bonds that are likely to be used to finance further fiscal stimulus programs.
Economists had viewed a standoff over the issue as a test of Japan's commitment to free market principles, including maintenance of a central bank free of political interference.

The Rawlinses now pay about $1,550 a month, or a rate of less than 7.5 percent, instead of $1,800, or nearly 9 percent, on the $192,000 mortgage on their Rancho Bernardo, Calif., house.
And the only cost -- appraisal and credit check being unnecessary -- was a few hundred dollars for title insurance and a recording fee.

Millions of people, of course, have refinanced homes as interest rates plunged from high double digits in the early 1980's to less than 7 percent as recently as last April.
Some have benefited from automatic, cost-free reductions provided by adjustable-rate mortgages.
But many people with adjustable mortgages are now finding their rates going up.
For City Line's borrowers, when rates fall by as little as half a percentage point, Mr. Riley will send E-mail or otherwise notify them that a lower rate can be theirs, so long as the mortgage payments have been on time for a year and the borrower remains employed.
City Line, a smallish, eight-year old family-owned mortgage banker in San Diego, is not being charitable.
About a year ago, Mr. Riley decided that there was a better living to be made by servicing mortgages over many years than by pocketing a quick few hundred dollars for originating loans and then watching customers refinance them elsewhere.
''We service our own loans.
If rates drop, why would I want you to go to Countrywide'' for refinancing, Mr. Riley asked, referring to one of the nation's biggest mortgage operations.
''Why wouldn't I want to keep you myself?''
Like most lenders, City Line sells its loans to large institutions.
But it continues to service the loans, generating $25 to $40 a month for collecting each payment, writing checks from the escrow account for taxes and insurance and keeping related records.
But its spread has been relatively slow.

One reason is that rates have been mostly on the rise this year, withering refinancing incentives for all but the most dilatory high-rate borrowers.
Many of those obtaining the loans now, therefore, are home buyers rather than refinancers.
Close ties to customers could prove crucial in assuring them of City Line's commitment to automatic downward adjustments, which is included in both a brochure and loan documents but whose enforceability appears to be legally untested.
Service Savers in Fairfax, Va., a division of National City Mortgage, has quietly given these loans to a few thousand customers since 1993.
The company is now promoting the mortgages, while saying that its commitment to cut rates cannot be legally binding because the loans would then be harder to resell.
Although Service Savers' rates tend to be a bit higher than those of other lenders, the company says that its lower closing costs and the prospect of rate cuts more than compensate.
''Why pay $4,000 to get a lower rate when you can wait and get that rate for fr
