Investors hope the Fed's new bias toward higher rates may be the kind of pre-emptive strike that calms fears about inflation, a fear stoked on Friday with the news that the Consumer Price Index jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent in April.
If so, rates may not rise much more.
An interest rate increase soon could also help guide the United States economy to the ''soft landing'' that Fed officials would like.
A soft landing means a slowing of growth here.
But it avoids a sharp decline, or even a recession, which would be much more damaging for emerging-market countries, many of which depend on Americans to buy their exports.
And even if the Fed does raise its short-term interest rate target, economists are not expecting a big move, such as the one that occurred when rates rose three full percentage points in just a year starting in February 1994.
The forecast among many economists and market strategists calls for a total rise of three-quarters of a percentage point in the Federal funds rate between this summer and the first half of next year.
That kind of move, said Jay Pelosky, the global emerging markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, ''is not a sufficient condition for derailing the new investment cycle in the emerging markets.''

Mr. Pelosky also argued that the Fed move is ''good for emerging markets because it will provide a pause or pullback for markets that have risen rapidly.''
Since October, the Morgan Stanley Capital International index of emerging markets has jumped more than 60 percent in dollar terms.
The immediate reaction to big news often deceives investors about the trend for the longer term.
It may also mean that investors are not that concerned about the consequences of any future Fed move.
The Fed also seemed to express confidence in the outlook for emerging markets.
Past comments by Fed policy makers suggest that they would not have taken this step if they thought it would undermine global financial markets.

While a modest move by the Fed would not devastate emerging markets, it would still curb their recoveries.
And even moderately higher interest rates -- a move, say, to more than 6 percent for long-term rates -- would make it harder for nations like Argentina and Venezuela to borrow.
Venezuela is now weighing a major global bond issue.
Plenty of uncertainty remains.
Until it is clear how serious any inflation threat in the United States actually is, speculation about when the Fed will raise rates and by how much will keep emerging markets volatile.
Referring to the Fed's new bias toward higher rates, he said, ''Clearly, it is not good news for emerging markets.''
But, he added, ''we are not expecting the Brazil rebound to be derailed.''
On Tuesday, Fed policy makers said that they were leaning toward raising rates to slow economic growth and curb inflation.
Although they did not actually raise their interest rate target, which is now 4.75 percent, the warning is now official.
''I think it's more confidence in the Fed,'' said Thomas Connor, head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities.
''They've got their eye on the ball here.''
The price of the 30-year bond, which is very sensitive to inflationary expectations, rose 1 2/32, to 92 7/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.80 percent, from 5.88 percent on Tuesday.

The yield on the two-year note was unchanged at 5.43 percent, and the yield on December futures on the Federal funds rate, which is the Fed's target rate, slipped to 5.15 percent from 5.17 percent.
This does not mean that investors think the Fed can avoid raising interest rates to curb inflation.
In fact, the yield on the December futures indicates they expect as much as half-a- percentage-point increase by then.

But if interest rates hold the line, it would show that investors expect the Fed to succeed in curbing inflationary pressures without having to raise interest rates significantly.
Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is forecasting a jump in the Fed funds rate of half a percentage point by the end of the year.
Mr. Berner said bond investors might have been heartened by the recent decline in commodity prices, especially oil.
Some industrial metal prices, including copper, have also declined recently, after strong rallies this spring.
Mr. Berner added that the dollar's new rally against the yen might be a signal that more Japanese investors would resume buying Treasury bonds, which would help alleviate the upward pressure on rates.
But rates are sure to bounce around for a while as new data on growth and prices are released.
Oil prices could turn around again, as some analysts are predicting.
And a revival in global economic growth could send other commodity prices up again.
Any indication that inflationary pressures are increasing will probably push rates higher, as investors speculate on when the central bank will finally pull the trigger.
The Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial watchdog, has begun taking a serious look at the foreign financial community here after having scrutinized the books of Japan's major banks.
The agency has also been investigating some of Credit Suisse First Boston's activities here for the last five months.
It is unclear exactly what the agency has been investigating at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The agency and the firm have declined to comment on the nature of the inquiry.
The supervisory agency has been working hard to establish its credentials as a tough, fair-minded regulator of a financial community that had grown accustomed to lenient treatment from the Ministry of Finance, its former overseer.

Many in the foreign financial community here believe that the Financial Supervisory Agency is looking into whether some firms used transactions involving derivative securities to help clients, including the bankrupt Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, conceal losses.
In the case of Credit Suisse First Boston, the agency also appears to be examining whether the firm's employees sought to impede its investigation by shredding and hiding documents and asking colleagues to withhold information.
Credit Suisse First Boston has suspended with pay its global head of compliance, Anthony Blunden, and Shinji Yamada, head of Credit Suisse Financial Products in Japan, and it has held back bonuses for several other employees in Tokyo, pending the results of its own internal investigation and the agency's inspection.

Some believe Lehman, which has a large derivatives business here, is suspected of similarly aiding Japanese companies and financial institutions in dressing up their income statements and balance sheets.
Foreign financial services firms have been anticipating tougher inspections for some time.
The Financial Supervisory Agency has conducted a sweeping review of Japanese banks and brokerage firms over the last year, so it was only logical to assume the agency would examine foreign firms as well, at least to give the impression of fairness.
After news broke of the agency's investigation into Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment banking arm of the big Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group, American firms went on alert, virtually certain that the agency would not single out a European firm without also aiming at an American one.
In the last few days, bankers said today, Lehman's name had arisen as the likely target, largely because of its extensive operations in derivatives, which are complex securities that derive value from something else, such as stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.
Foreign bankers have reacted to the agency's searches with mild interest partly because they hope the process will provide some clarity to what they regard as substantial gray areas in Japanese regulations.
''Hopefully, this will turn into a learning experience for all of us,'' said an executive at one foreign firm.
On Tuesday, Federal Reserve policy makers said that they were leaning toward raising interest rates to slow economic growth and curb inflation.
Although they did not raise their interest rate target, which is now 4.75 percent, the warning is now official.

Japanese Banks Report Big Losses

Japan's eight largest banks have reported steep fiscal-year losses.
The poor performance largely reflected efforts by the banks to clean their books by writing off bad loans.
The main reason is that the banks must follow stricter rules for evaluating bad loans and creating a deeper cushion of money in the event that good loans go bad.

Now that the world's eighth largest economy has begun to right itself, for example, all the talk about ''global contagion'' seems particularly exaggerated.
Nor was it equivalent to Russia, where the collapse of a Communist state has allowed a mafia to seize control of the economy, or even Mexico, where one corrupt and ossified political party has wielded power for 70 years.

''Wall Street needs a geography lesson,'' Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, a former Cabinet minister who is now president of the Brazilian Association of Exporters, said recently.
''A bank goes bust in Moscow and they sell their Brazilian shares?
They should go back to school.''
Too late for Brazil and its 165 million people, who have had to endure lost jobs and recession since January, stock markets around the world seemed to recognize that error this month.
Other measures of Brazil's strengths are, if anything, more revealing.
In contrast to the traumas that have wracked Russia and the Asian tigers recently, Latin America's largest country has in just 15 years successfully made the transition, without violence or social trauma, from military dictatorship to democracy.
Its democracy is often raucous, as is demonstrated by a current Congressional investigation into insider trading that took place at the time of January's devaluation.
But even though Mr. Cardoso has to work within a system of checks and balances more restrictive than the systems facing his Asian, Russian and Mexican counterparts, he has time and again delivered on promises to restructure the Brazilian state and economy.
After the agreement with the I.M.F.
As political leaders here have noted, none of the countries that have been hectoring Brazil on this matter -- not Germany, not France, not Italy, and certainly not the United States -- have themselves begun to come to grips with the issue at home.
Mr. Cardoso maintained that course, showing unusual political courage, even when a harsh recession set in after the eruption of the Asian crisis in 1997, threatening both his re-election and efforts to stabilize both prices and the real.
The late Carroll Quigley, the Georgetown University professor whom Mr. Clinton has cited as his most influential teacher, used to define capitalism as ''a system of accounting that ignores social costs.''
Judging from Brazil's recent experience, the converse is also true: market-driven philosophies are unwilling to grant credit for social gains that cannot immediately be measured.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

TO Riordan Roett, an expert on the Western Hemisphere at Johns Hopkins University, Mr. Cardoso's most significant achievement may be that during his first term ''more Brazilians were lifted from poverty than in the past 50 years.''
That feat, a result of the same inflation control and currency stabilization program that came under speculative pressure in January, has turned millions of poor Brazilians into consumers and makes the country more attractive to foreign investors hunting for new markets.
''These are extraordinary numbers for so short a period,'' a ''gigantic leap,'' Claudio de Moura Castro, an economist who is the co-author of the study, wrote in the news magazine Veja.
In the long term, of course, they also represent a social investment that will benefit foreign companies in the form of better-educated workers who will, as a consequence, earn higher salaries and be able to spend more money.
A generation ago, Charles de Gaulle visited here and rendered a verdict on Brazilian society so stinging that it is still frequently recalled, always with chagrin.
''This is not a serious country,'' the French leader said.
Brazil in 1999 may still be associated primarily with soccer and samba, but in a perverse way the January crisis was a yardstick of how far the country has come: Thirty-five years ago, even an economic collapse here would have had little impact elsewhere.
Today, for better or worse, Brazil matters.
At a conference in Chicago earlier this month, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, cautioned that Brazil is ''not quite out of the woods,'' a warning that a suddenly euphoric market now seems prepared to discount.
Investors snapped up more than $2 billion in Brazilian bonds issued last month, and so much foreign investment is flowing back into the country that the Government has had to adjust its estimate upward to as high as $20 billion for the year.
Mr. Cardoso himself, however, ever the realist, appears to be as unmoved by the sudden recovery of confidence in Brazil as he was by its January jitters.
So let the market beware.
Cleanup crews have already hauled away 12 million tons of the noxious mud, along with topsoil and dead fish and fowl, and dumped the mess in an unused quarry.
The mine, owned by Boliden Ltd. of Canada, has spent more than $52 million cleaning up, repairing damage and reimbursing farmers for lost crops.
The 20-mile-long flood area looks fairly clean, except for the black mud stains marking walls and bridges.

But a toxic chain has spread through nature that is less visible and may be difficult to break down.
High levels of heavy metals are still embedded in soil and water and have found their way into the wildlife.
Some scientists say it may take years for nature to return the area to normal.
One trouble spot is the nearby Donana reserve and its buffer zone, a kind of European Everglades that is cherished by many nature buffs.
In this mixture of swamps and woodlands, 300 species of birds breed, feed or stop over on their migratory route between Northern Europe and Africa.
Hastily built dikes stopped the toxic flood from entering the reserve, but the contaminated water cut through the buffer zone, and frogs, eels, lizards and insects have fed there.
Those in turn have been eaten by birds like storks, flamingos and ibises.
''It will affect their immune systems and their young.''
The study of the geese is seen as an illustration of the far wider problem throughout the food chain.
''Geese are eaten by eagles and lynxes -- it's a big part of their diet,'' said Miguel Ferrer, a biologist at the Donana reserve.
Because of the contamination, Spain has advised the Scandinavian countries to put a temporary ban on hunting of the geese, many of which fly north for the summer.

But even that may not halt the toxic trail.
Such worrying about the wildlife angers the local farmers, who feel they have a more immediate problem.
They cannot cultivate the once fertile flood plains that used to brim with orchards, rice paddies and cotton and sunflower fields.
Catching fish or river crabs is also forbidden.
Farmers want to know more about the future of their land.

''The most troublesome is the arsenic residue,'' said Mr. Nombela, discussing the most recent soil studies.
''We know very little about how to remove it.''
Biologists are experimenting with chemical treatments and hope to use plants to absorb the contamination, he said.
In the river valley, around the farming town of Aznalcazar, a confrontation is brewing.
The Andalusian regional government has said it wants to turn the affected areas into a 70-mile-long ''green belt,'' plant trees to halt the erosion and create riding and biking trails.
The plan is to cost $160 million, of which Andalusia hopes one-third will be paid by the European Union.
The regional government has just announced that it intends to expropriate 10,000 acres of farmland for its plan, which will affect 400 families.
But the farmers around Aznalcazar said they will fight the plan in court.
''I'm not moving,'' said Mr. Alvarez, whose land is on the expropriation list.
''I'll keep the land fallow as long as it takes.
But I won't give it up.
They're offering less than half the value.''
Carmen Moraira, a local farmer who is coordinating the protests, said the ''green belt plan'' was merely a ploy to get money from the European Union.
''The Government's new love for the environment is phony,'' she said, pointing to piles of garbage on public land.
Eight towns dump their untreated sewage into the Guadiamar River.
''Even as children we could never swim here,'' she said.
Upstream, the zinc mine has just reopened.
But the village of Aznalcazar has lobbied hard to open it.
The village depends on the mine and its 500 jobs.
The judge has made little headway.
To reach a decision, the court needs an independent technical report.
Figures released by the Office of National Statistics showed that British economic growth ground to a halt in the first quarter, the first time that has happened since the second quarter of 1992, the end of the last recession.
The data raised expectations that the Bank of England, which has cut interest rates by 2.25 points, to 5.25 percent, since October, would cut rates further this summer to stimulate growth.

''This correction is largely a function of declining Internet stocks,'' said Laszlo Birinyi of the research firm Birinyi & Associates.

Technology and Internet stocks that trade on Nasdaq suffered most yesterday.
Internet shares have been harder hit.
Since a peak on April 12, the index has lost 30 percent of its value.
It was a bad day to varying degrees in almost every corner of the market.
Paul Cook, lead portfolio manager of the Munder NetNet Fund, which has a little more than $2 billion in assets under management, said profit taking, the threat of higher interest rates and a supply of new issues were putting pressure on stocks.
And since these are high-multiple stocks, they are going to suffer if interest rates move higher.''
Investors facing margin calls in Internet stocks may have been forced to sell Dow stocks to meet them, Mr. Birinyi said.
A spokesman for Charles Schwab, Mo Shafroth, said: ''In the last couple of days, when the Nasdaq takes a dip, it is often the case that there is an increase in margin calls.
I can't quantify how much margin calls are up, but it is more than a little and less than a lot.''

Treasury Prices Rise

By Bloomberg News

Bond prices were little changed yesterday, gaining support from falling stocks, declines in commodities and waning corporate debt demand.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.74 percent from 5.76 percent.
Bonds bounced back as stocks fell in afternoon trading, making less-risky Treasuries attractive.
Waning demand for corporate debt also bolstered the Treasuries' appeal.

To the Editor:

The longest post-World War II recovery with declining unemployment rates and skilled labor shortages is finally benefiting those at the bottom of the economic ladder.
Black male unemployment is declining (front page, May 23), and real wages are finally increasing after almost three decades of stagnation.
What is the response of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to this good news?
Concern over barely discernible inflation and hints that the Fed should raise interest rates.
Tight monetary policy has been a major contributor to employment and wage gaps among the races.
A pre-emptive strike against the possibility of inflation would undermine recent gains by African-American men and lead to a growth in inequality.
MICHAEL ROSEN

Milwaukee, May 24, 1999

The writer is the chairman of the economics department, Milwaukee Area Technical College.
The Brazilian Government and car makers reached an agreement cutting taxes on automobiles as an effort to save jobs in an industry battered by high interest rates.
The accord maintains a previous pact that lowered taxes on small- and medium-sized cars in exchange for pledges from car makers, including General Motors and Fiat, to delay layoffs.
Taxes will remain reduced for 90 days; car makers will suspend job cuts for 120 days.

The Nasdaq index is up 12.67 percent so far this year.
Those indexes have gained 5.9 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, since Dec. 31.
''I always find it a little peculiar when people then try to search for an answer when we're off 5 percent.
The market has been very efficient over the last three to four years at backing off when things got a little too far ahead of themselves.''
Among them is continued uncertainty about the progress of the battles in Yugoslavia, including the possibility of a ground war involving American troops.

The recent declines in the Dow industrials and most other indexes retrace only a portion of recent gains.
After rising in 9 of 10 weeks from the end of February through mid-May, the Dow industrial average has fallen in each of the last three weeks.
Those declines date to the May 13 announcement that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin would resign and include last week's announcement by the Federal Reserve that it might raise interest rates if it continues to see signs of inflation.
The list of Dow stocks that gained the most this spring almost perfectly matches the list of losers in the last three weeks.
Alcoa, for example, rose from $40.50 to $63.875 from Feb. 28 through May 7, a gain of more than 57 percent; in the last three weeks, the shares have fallen back to $55, a 14 percent decline.
Shares of Allied Signal, DuPont and Goodyear Tire and Rubber have followed similar trajectories.
Interest rates, which have generally been climbing since the beginning of the year, have risen more sharply in recent weeks.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell slightly, to 5.82 percent from 5.84 percent on Thursday.
Among the most active stocks on American markets yesterday, Microsoft gained 2 5/16 , to 80 11/16 , making it the single biggest contributor to the day's gain in the S.& P. 500.
Yahoo will take a $68 million pretax charge in the second quarter related to the acquisition.
Paine Webber, which will become part of the S.& P. 500 index after the close of trading next Friday, rose 2 9/16 , to 47.
Paine Webber will replace Bankers Trust, which is being acquired by Deutsche Bank, in the index.
The announcement of its addition to the popular index usually bolsters a company's stock price, as buyers and speculators rush to buy the shares in the hope that more buying will come from large investors who track the index.
Mr. Greenspan's third four-year term as Fed chairman will expire in just over a year.
He has not given any public hint about his plans.
The betting in Washington is that he will choose to stay for another term, that President Clinton will be happy to nominate him and that the Senate will confirm him expeditiously.

But Mr. Greenspan could still prove to be less out of the Cal Ripken mold -- an Iron Man soldiering on, but at risk of playing past his prime -- and more of a Michael Jordan, choosing to retire while on top of his game.
For an economic policy maker, on top might be defined as next year, when the current expansion will become the longest in the nation's history.
IN any case, since Mr. Greenspan's willingness and ability to serve another term are not sure things, speculation has begun about who will be tapped to succeed him, whenever he goes.
Here is a handicapper's guide to likely entries in the race.
(The list would look very different if that moment comes after a new President is elected, especially a Republican President.)
* William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is on nearly everyone's list.
He is the leading candidate from within the Federal Reserve, if only because of the key role the New York Fed plays in monitoring the financial system at home and abroad.
A former banker and diplomat, he played an important part in orchestrating the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management last year and is active in efforts to strengthen global banking standards.
But while he is well known on Wall Street, he is little known in Washington.
And although he votes loyally with Mr. Greenspan on interest rate policy, he has never established a strong public reputation as an inflation fighter.
Early line: 4-1.

* As vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alice M. Rivlin is an obvious candidate, and within the White House the notion of appointing a woman to the post has some appeal.
But while she is a well-respected economist, she is viewed with some suspicion on Wall Street, and she may have diminished her influence within the Fed by spending much of her time helping the District of Columbia clean up its finances.
Early line: 10-1.
* Janet L. Yellen, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, is also seen by Administration insiders as a viable candidate.
A former Fed governor, she has a strong reputation among academic economists as well as Washington experience.
But some analysts question whether she has the leadership qualities a Fed chief needs.
Early line: 15-1.
* Other long shot candidates include Laurence H. Meyer, who was appointed a Fed governor by Mr. Clinton and is the board's most outspoken proponent of orthodox inflation fighting (20-1).
Outside of the Fed, Mr. Clinton could turn to a corps of executives who move between the worlds of Washington and finance.
Among them is Franklin D. Raines, the former White House budget chief, who is now chief executive at Fannie Mae (25-1).
* Of course, Mr. Clinton has two other candidates he can call on in a pinch.
One is Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary and Mr. Clinton's nominee to succeed Mr. Rubin.
A brilliant economist and a forceful personality, Mr. Summers has all the gravitas the Fed job requires and seems to be learning the art of keeping his mouth closed when circumstances dictate, a requirement for any Fed chairman.
Among his fans is Mr. Greenspan, who publicly endorsed his nomination for Treasury Secretary.
Should Mr. Clinton need him more at the Fed than at Treasury, Mr. Summers would be the clear favorite (2-1).
* Then there is Bob Rubin.
The outgoing Treasury Secretary shows no signs of wanting to come back to Washington.
Moreover, he is not an economist and could find the intricacies of monetary policy heavy going.
But his reputation on Wall Street is second only to that of Mr. Greenspan.
.

(A lead-pipe cinch, but only under those unlikely circumstances).
In the meantime, is there a second to that motion for protective custody?
In the process, a new generation of companies is emerging with a different profile than earlier groups.
The newcomers have borrowed the strategy -- favored by Thomson Newspapers and others -- of buying clusters of newspapers in one geographic area, sharing printing and accounting operations and offering big regional advertisers five or six papers in a single buy.
But unlike the established publishing companies, which acquire large and small newspapers in both rural and urban settings, the newcomers have focused exclusively on community newspapers in out-of-the-way regions where the skies are truly dark at night.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Leading the new wave is a company in Birmingham, Ala., called Community Newspaper Holdings Inc., which bought The Times and 44 other newspapers late last year and, in the process, became the biggest little-newspaper company in the country with 95 dailies and 125 weeklies.
What's more, Community Newspaper Holdings is a rarity: its sole investor is a pension fund, which has provided all its working capital.
The Retirement Systems of Alabama, which has $22 billion in assets, has loaned the company $1.13 billion to buy newspapers.
What would a pension fund want with small newspapers, the bottom end of a business that is, in the polite put-down of the financial world, mature?
Small newspapers are suffering from the same problems as their larger brethren: declining circulation and limited growth potential for the ink-on-paper product.
But Community Newspaper and others see gold in the steady if unspectacular cash flow of small businesses that often operate with little or no competition.
There are other incentives.
Think synergy at its most basic.
The director of the Alabama pension fund, David Bronner, wanted a solid return on his investment and a media platform from which to sing the virtues of his adopted state of Alabama.
With Community Newspaper, he gets both.
John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, set up the pension fund manager's calculation like this: ''I can invest in the bond market and earn five or six percent -- or I can invest in all of these teeny cash-flow engines stuck all over the place'' for double that return.
''Even if we have a national recession,'' Mr. Morton added, ''these are pretty durable.''
That durability, however, depends on putting the right combination of newspapers together.
Not all regions fit Community Newspaper's vision.
Ralph J. Martin, the company's top executive, is looking for areas with stable or growing populations, far enough away from large television markets that there are few competitors for local advertising dollars.
He has developed a rough formula.
For long-term economic stability, Mr. Martin said, it helps if a newspaper is near a county seat (lawyers tend to be newspaper readers; governments take out legal advertising); near large educational and medical institutions (educated work force, recession-resistant employers); near large government operations (recession-resistant, stable employers), and near an Interstate highway (truck traffic and tourism keeps communities healthy).
He has selected Community Newspaper's newspapers with an eye to minimizing the effects of an economic downturn.
Mr. Martin, the president and chief executive of Community Newspaper Holdings, said recessions tend to hit the country at large for 18 months to two years; in markets that fit his formula, he said, recessions have lasted eight months or less.
To further reduce risk, he is diversifying.
Community Newspaper's publications are based in a mixed basket of micro-economies in places from northern New York to Kentucky to Texas, reducing the risk that all the revenue streams would dry up simultaneously.

Even so, newspapers are not exactly a traditional investment for a pension fund, but then again, Mr. Bronner is not exactly a traditional pension fund manager.
His investments have also included a Manhattan skyscraper -- 55 Water Street -- a steel mill in Birmingham, chemical plants in Mobile, Ala., a Wal-Mart distribution center in Cullman, and his favorite, a series of golf courses around his adopted state.
''He does a lot of unorthodox things,'' Mr. Stein said.
''He's an entrepreneur in an industry that is dominated by passive investors.''
In 25 years, the assets have grown to $22 billion.
''There is a reason to be out on the cutting edge on some of the things I do,'' Mr. Bronner said.
''But I think about it very hard.''
Investment decisions, he said, are made for financial reasons first, and then are designed to meet one other unique criterion: ''Can I change the image of Alabama?''
The Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail now has 324 holes to play in seven locations around the state.
Which is where the newspapers come in.
In addition to interest rates ranging from 9 to 10.4 percent, the Retirement Systems of Alabama requires, as a condition of its loans to Community Newspaper, that the company's papers provide free advertising space to the pension fund to promote the virtues of Alabama.

One of the company's other partners, Tom Lindley 3d, is a reporter turned editor turned publisher, who is living out old daydreams of running his hometown newspaper.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

On paper, the company's financial goals fit Mr. Lindley's notion of the right balance between profit and investment in journalism.
That is well below the 30 percent-plus margins of some Wall Street favorites, like the Gannett Company.
Editors and publishers may not double as local political leaders and no article may be run unless the subject of the piece has had a fair chance to present his or her side.
Mr. Martin has encouraged the 53 Community Newspaper publications in Oklahoma to create a common statehouse bureau that none could have afforded on its own; the bureau opened four months ago.
There is a question as to whether the state of Alabama, through its pension fund, could have a financial interest in a paper like The Cullman Times without tainting its journalism.
Will Alabama get kid-glove treatment from Community Newspaper?
''No,'' Mr. Bronner said, ''because I know we will drag one foot forward and shoot it off every once in a while.''
All he wants, he said, is to make clear that ''there are some positive aspects along with the negative aspects.''
As described in the current issue of American Journalism Review, the reporters covering the corruption-ridden, economically depressed community balked at Ed Martin's insistence that, when it comes to news, ''good and bad have the same weight.''
Edward C. Dowling Jr., editor and publisher of The Cullman Times, said in a recent interview that a classic newspaper company mistake ''is to think that all markets are the same and can be approached in a cookie-cutter fashion.''
He wants the latitude to earn his community's respect.
Mr. Lindley, who is also editor and publisher of The Evening News in Jeffersonville, Ala., has similar aims.

In fact, Mr. Lindley was the matchmaker between the two key players in Community Newspaper.
One of Mr. Bronner's conditions, on making the initial loan, was that Mr. Lindley would be one of the company's owners.
Mr. Lindley had first-hand experience of what small-town newspapers can go through.
Starting salaries for reporters were $265 a week.
Just a few months before, a feature writer had been living in a homeless shelter.
Then Mr. Martin went looking for more.
For the moment, Mr. Martin said, Community Newspaper is resting on its laurels.
Some future acquisitions and adjustments may be made, but none are on the immediate horizon.
Mr. Lindley now worries about both profit and news, but more about news.
''If we don't do a good job in that regard, then the money will never come,'' he said.
He has hired a city editor and a photographer, neither of which the paper had.
As of now, he said, ''It's not great yet, but it's gotten better.''
The news staff is up from 9 to 11 and starting salaries are up 35 percent, to about $360.
And letters to the editor are pouring in; at the end of last month's mayoral race, Mr. Lindley found the angry incumbent mayor banging on his door on a Saturday night, ''scorched'' in Mr. Lindley's word, by letters he didn't like.

Financial markets in the United States are open today; they were closed yesterday in observance of Memorial Day.
Stocks sold off early yesterday on concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates later this month.
''For the time being, this is a market that is fixated on numbers, not earnings.''
He added, referring to the employment report, due out Friday, ''The wage component of that report will be closely scrutinized by the Fed, and by the market.''
Comments by William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reinforced the impression that policy makers seem increasingly concerned that inflationary pressures are building in the economy.

The rise in interest rates is causing equity strategists and money managers to reposition their portfolios.
It was disclosed yesterday that Jeff Vinik, the former lead portfolio of Fidelity's Magellan fund who now heads his own asset management firm, cut his equity exposure by about $3 billion during the first quarter, selling out positions in Intel, Microsoft and Compaq Computer, among others.
And last week Christine A. Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, announced the first shift in her model portfolio in more than two years by paring her position in stocks.
''We cut our equity exposure because the market is becoming increasingly sensitive to the back-up in interest rates,'' she said yesterday.
''Over the next year, we expect the total return on stocks will lag that of bonds by about seven percentage points.''
Thirty percent of her portfolio is in bonds and 15 percent is in cash.
Financial service stocks, which are acutely sensitive to rising interest rates, were hammered yesterday.
''This is a collection of boxes that people run away from, '' said Elliott Bernerd, the latest person to take on the eyesore as chairman of the South Bank Center.

The complex, occupying one of the most privileged pieces of real estate on earth -- the shoreline of the Thames at a bend that looks across at the Houses of Parliament to the west and St. Paul's Cathedral to the east -- has been a growing visual irritant since it was assembled 30 years ago, when progressive British architects disdained grace and championed guts.
Last year Richard Rogers, the creator of the Pompidou Center in Paris and a noted lecturer on urban London who is a member of the House of Lords and friend of Prime Minister Tony Blair, failed to gain sufficient financing for his plan to sheathe the offending complex in undulating glass.
Struck by the ability of this blot on the London landscape to escape all attempts at face lifts, Rowan Moore, the architecture critic of The Evening Standard, wrote last month: ''The South Bank Arts Center resembles one of those riddling monsters you get in medieval myths, who ask gallant knights deceptively simple questions and then chomp them into powder when they give the wrong answer.''
Mr. Bernerd, 53, the man atop the latest white charger to ride in, is a London-based international property developer, a highly successful self-made man with a reputation for getting things done in ways not always apt to please the sensitivities of esthetes.
But this time it is the resistant concrete bunker of South Bank, not Mr. Bernerd, that is likely to be chomped into powder.
He announced early on that he would not hesitate to bulldoze the offending buildings if necessary.
They held a competition for master planner, narrowed the choice down to a short-list of four architects including Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and Sir Michael Hopkins and then unanimously settled on Rick Mather, an architect with experience in designing buildings for a number of British museums and universities.
His $35 million Neptune Hall has just opened to popular praise at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.
Mr. Mather, a 61-year-old Oregonian with a laconic Pacific Coast manner unaffected by the 36 years he has spent living and working in London, is now charged with coming up with the final plan to recreate the complex, estimated to cost at least $150 million.
The South Bank Center has five buildings, the Jubilee Gardens public green and a parking lot in its 27 acres of river frontage.
The centerpiece is the Royal Festival Hall, built during the 1951 Festival of Britain.
It is as open, inviting and appreciated as the later buildings are off-putting, forbidding and shunned.

In that same year, 1967, the overworked cement mixer produced elevated walkways designed to ease pedestrian passage into the buildings from the street below.
They ended up turning what had once been a lively thoroughfare of small storefronts into a dreary service road and incarcerating the complex in a lumpen girdle of stone.
Probably the most hated single feature of the complex, they are being partially demolished this summer.
In 1975 the Royal National Theater was built next door, and though it is not officially part of the South Bank Center, it is a natural extension of the complex and indistinguishable in the public mind from the rest.
A central premise of any plan that Mr. Mather will be recommending is to take back the cheerless walk along the river from the muggers and muttering solitary types who now lurk in its shadows and turn it into a promenade with cafes, shops and public spaces that will take advantage of the stirring view across the water of illuminated grand hotels, ornate Government ministries and church steeples.
''This needs to feel part of the city again, to be busy and full of life all day,'' said Mr. Mather.
This objective will be aided by two independent ventures now beginning construction, a millennium celebration ferris wheel, said to be the world's largest, at one end of the center's land and a new pedestrian bridge crossing the Thames to replace a current gangway approach alongside the Hungerford railroad bridge that is ankle deep in puddles whenever it rains.
Which in London is to say almost every day.
The experience of approaching South Bank buildings is no happier than the one of departing, leaving visitors with the impression that they are going in furtively by a service entrance or a side door.
Mr. Mather plans to restore a grand marquee that once gave a sense of occasion to entering the Royal Festival Hall and to open up other entranceways to the river.
Plans are already under way to strip away partitions and other additions of the last 40 years that have cluttered its interior expanses.
It was Britain's first public postwar modern building and is the only one in the complex officially covered by a preservation listing.
A study to warm up its sound, long considered too dry and harsh, is to be completed this summer by Larry Kierkegaard, an American acoustics specialist.
Mr. Mather is working from four options, ranging from simple refurbishment to outright demolition and reconstruction of three buildings.
In all the plans, cinema becomes a far greater presence than now, with new quarters planned for the National Film Center, the Museum of the Moving Image and the British Film Institute.
A film school may be created, and a multiplex commercial movie theater will go in nearby.
A circular Imax building has just opened in an adjacent plaza.
So what's different this time from the past visionary projects backed by big names and fed by public yearning ?
One answer is that the end proposal intends to recommend gradual, sequential development rather than a massive one-shot project of the kind of monumentality that has sunk past ventures.
''This time,'' he said with convincing concentration, ''it's going to happen.''
While unexpected, Ms. Rivlin's resignation is unlikely to have a crucial effect on the debate within the Fed on the degree of danger that inflation poses to the nation's long economic expansion.

She has been perhaps the most outspoken proponent at the central bank of the view that the economy is more capable of noninflationary growth than in the past, and more sympathetic than most of her fellow policy makers to the idea that driving the unemployment rate lower under those circumstances is worth the risk of a slight uptick in prices.
''Greenspan has the bulk of the power, given both his position as chairman and his successful stewardship of the Fed up until now,'' said William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
''This doesn't really change things very much.''
And Mr. Greenspan showed every sign of wanting to stay on in the job even after his third term ends next June.

In her resignation letter to Mr. Clinton, Ms. Rivlin said, ''The Fed is a strong bulwark of U.S. economic policy, and I believe we have contributed to keeping the American economy growing and reducing strains in the international financial system.''.

Fed watchers have scrutinized the central bank particularly closely the last several weeks, after its decision on May 18 to tilt policy toward an increase in interest rates.
The first substantial clue could come on Friday, when the Labor Department releases May unemployment data.
In many ways, the Fed's discussions in coming weeks will crystallize a debate that has dominated policy making for the last several years.
To a substantial degree, that debate has revolved around issues central to Ms. Rivlin's view of the economy.
She has made the case that not just factors like higher productivity are tamping down inflation, but that low unemployment -- seen in traditional economic models as a trigger for inflation -- might itself be spurring higher productivity by forcing companies to hold down wage costs through improved efficiency.
''Economists have had in their head the idea that tight labor markets would lead to inflation and low productivity,'' she said in an interview in April with The Financial Times.
''It may be that under the present circumstances of fierce global competition, the effect of tight labor markets is exactly the opposite.''
Ms. Rivlin has also been forthright in her belief that a low unemployment rate -- especially during a period in which Federal, state and local governments are pushing many welfare recipients into the work force for the first time -- is a benefit that should not be given away through blind adherence to old rules about the relationship between inflation, growth and unemployment.
''The models have been predicting higher inflation based on tight labor markets,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis.
The selloffs in stocks since May 18, when the Fed first indicated it was leaning toward a rate increase, have been enough to compensate for higher interest rates, in the view of many investors.

As the Cornerstone Mastercard program of Mellon Bank comes to an end, customers are being freed from a dubious, though superficially attractive, bargain.
The deal, begun by the bank in 1993, was that consumers would get all their interest payments back in a rebate -- after 20 years.
Citicorp, which bought Mellon's credit-card business this year, is ending the program.
Cornerstone customers will get money back much sooner, though not all they have paid.
In October, card holders will get one-twentieth of the interest paid for each year they were in the program, bringing them out roughly even, since the bank will no longer hold their money for the remainder of the planned 20-year term.
Citicorp would not discuss customer reaction to the plan or say how many cards were involved.

Over the course of the NATO bombing campaign against the Serbs, Mrs. Theodosakia, Mrs. McCauley and several of their neighbors in White Plains have been asked regularly to discuss their opinions about the war.
None have relatives or friends in the military.
So without a personal stake in the conflict, they have been paying less attention to what has been happening in Yugoslavia.
They all expressed relief that the Yugoslav leadership appears to have accepted NATO's terms for ending the bombing, but they are skeptical about whether NATO's aims have been accomplished.
Mrs. Theodosakia, who describes herself as a conservative, has come full circle in her views about the war.
At first mistrustful of President Clinton's motives, she came to rally to the NATO cause, believing it a moral mission to save the Kosovo Albanians.
Now, Mrs. Theodosakia, who at age 57 is about to start a new career as a nutritionist, is once again deeply suspicious of the motivations of NATO leaders.
''In every war, there's something behind it -- politics or selfishness on somebody's part -- and yet civilians are the ones who suffer,'' she said.
''I'd really like to know the truth, why they were doing this just in Yugoslavia when there are people suffering all over the world.''

Mr. Clark, a trim 58-year-old, served in Vietnam as a marine and that experience still marks his views.
He looks with a skeptic's eye at any war, no matter how noble sounding its goals, and recalled his own war days as a time when he ''saw kids dying like flies.''
During the more than two months of the Kosovo war, he has had very little patience with what he sees as the bombast of military commanders.
So when NATO missiles began occasionally to go astray, killing Serbian civilians and in some cases Kosovo Albanians, Mr. Clark considered his cynicism well founded.
''There have been so many civilian casualties,'' he said.
Once you go to war, even if you have all these high-tech weapons, as long as you're human, you're going to have errors.''
The only way he could explain his indifference was, again, to reach back to his own memories as a soldier.
''I knew no one would really win.
Been there.
Done that.''
Mrs. McCauley's interest, on the other hand, never flagged.
At 69, she is old enough to remember her father serving in the Army in World War II.
''It was war,'' she said, ''and you never think of anything as being worth war.
But I just don't think Milosevic would have done anything without this war.
He would have just gone on with his ethnic cleansing.''

''It has built in strong expectations of a near-term Fed tightening.''
Referring to the Commerce Department's scheduled release of the Consumer Price Index, Mr. Fine continued, ''Even if next week's C.P.I.
is nonthreatening, the Fed is still likely to tighten on June 30, irrespective of the May C.P.I.
because even a subdued C.P.I.
would have to completely reverse market expectations in order to keep the central bank on hold, which is very unlikely.''

Many market participants are already predicting a quarter-point increase and expect this week's economic reports to provide enough incentive for the 30-year bond to test the 6 percent level, though Mr. Blankman thinks that the final outcome will rest with the midmonth Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
''We believe the Fed will wait for a smoking gun to hike rates,'' Mr. Blankman said.

''It's something you always dream about, playing in the Stanley Cup finals.
We have a lot of 22- and 23-year-olds who have never been there.
Sweaty palms on the way out to the ice.''
Woolley seems to have made a favorable impression on several key Sabres, including Ruff, Captain Mike Peca and defenseman Aleksei Zhitnik, Woolley's power-play partner on the blue line.
''People didn't realize Jason is a good player defensively as well as offensively.
He's slowly earned that respect.
He's a very strong kid.''

Peca, another strong guy, said Woolley ''in the weight room, is one of our strongest guys'' and is someone ''who's never been handed anything.''
Woolley admitted he is ''a little bit uncomfortable'' leading his team in scoring and probably would not have that honor if Miroslav Satan, the high-scoring forward, had not been injured through so much of the playoffs.

''Now, it's here,'' he said.
''It's been a lot of hard work and determination.

But, at the same time, he argued that Argentina could weather a rise in short-term interest rates by the United States Federal Reserve.
With many investors already expecting the Fed to raise the overnight lending rate between banks at the end of the month, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.06 percent yesterday, the highest in more than a year, from 6.02 percent on Wednesday; the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 14/32 , to 88 30/32 .
Today, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its retail sales report for May.
If the report is strong, as some forecasters expect, it might help drive interest rates higher because it will be another sign that the economy is not slowing enough to curb inflation.

In an address to money managers at a bond conference held by J. P. Morgan Securities in New York, Miguel Alberto Kiguel, the Argentine Under Secretary of Finance, noted that the spreads between interest rates on Latin American debt and those on comparable United States Treasuries ''are higher than historical levels.''
He also acknowledged being asked tough questions by foreign investors, including ''What other shock might come?''
''The Fed is making them more nervous,'' Mr. Kiguel said of investors.
According to bond indexes kept by J. P. Morgan, the spread between Latin American bonds and comparable United States Treasuries is now 8.74 percentage points, up from 7.65 before the Fed said it had shifted its bias toward a rate increase.
In Argentina, the spread is up to 7.59 percentage points, from 6.60, according to the index, while the spread in Brazil has jumped to 10.41 percentage points, from 9.20 in May.

Historically, a jump in United States interest rates has been bad for emerging markets because it raises a country's cost of borrowing and can drive foreign investors away.
Flows of foreign capital into Argentina have been a key engine of the nation's economic cycle, Mr. Kiguel said, ''so what happens to interest rates in the region will be critical.''
In addition, any rate increase that slows American economic growth will also curb growth in Latin America as Americans buy fewer of the region's exports.

Jose Luis Daza, the managing director for emerging markets at J. P. Morgan Securities, forecast continuing volatility in those markets as investors await the Fed's decision.
Still, Mr. Daza said, ''when the threat of inflation is eliminated,'' he was predicting an emerging-markets rally.
In three months, he expects the spread in the Morgan index to narrow to 9 percentage points, and, in 12 months, to just 6.5 percentage points.
The spread is now 11.33 percentage points.
But, he said, Argentina should have no problem doing this, ''even in a rough environment.''

Every year, the National Association for College Admission Counseling publishes a list in which colleges advertise the slots left open in all their classes.
This year, many of the better-known colleges that have appeared in the past are not on the list.
One result of the pressure has been that the way applicants groom themselves for college has taken on greater importance.
''It used to be that people worried about having a good resume upon leaving college,'' said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education in Washington.
''The stakes have now moved down the chain, with students wanting a good early start including good high school internships to get them into college.''
But lately, even that approach does not seem to assure success.
Matthew D. Lerner, who is graduating from high school in Swamp scott, Mass., this month, is seen by many of those around him as a model college applicant.

Mount Holyoke College is facing a similar problem with 50 more accepted students than it has room for.
So is Trinity College in Hartford.
Many other schools -- Vanderbilt in Tennessee, Pomona in California, Wabash in Indiana -- have had record years.
''I have been in this business for 30 years and I can't remember a time when there has been such a shift,'' said Carl Bewig, director of college counseling at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., one of the nation's most selective preparatory academies.
College counselors and others who watch the admissions process say that early in this season they detected crowding at the top colleges, and figured it was because it is now so easy for students, aided by computers and the Internet, to apply to many colleges.
Besides that, the thirst for brand names has never been greater, and top universities have greatly increased their financial aid as their endowments have risen with the stock market.
The theory went that at less selective institutions there would be far less pressure.
Each student might have submitted numerous applications but ultimately could choose only one college.
Then the other places would open up.
That has not turned out to be the case.
Colleges that a decade ago worried about finding enough good students are now happily overwhelmed.
An example is Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., which had a record number of applicants for the fourth straight year.

Muhlenberg feels it has improved its reputation through a building and marketing campaign.
The college, like many others, has invested in a new athletics complex and student union, intending to make it a more attractive, and has recruited and advertised around the country.
The fortunes of places like Muhlenberg are all the more remarkable when considering the growing number of alternatives to attending a private college, like on-line learning and for-profit universities, and the much cheaper alternative of state universities.
Demographers call this generation of students the baby boomlet or the baby boom echo because they are the children of the generation that bulged after World War II.

As a result, San Diego State University, with a 28 percent increase in applications this year, now requires a higher grade point average, 3.2 out of 4.0 intead of 2.5.
There are states, like West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana, where there is a projected decrease in 18-year-olds because of a drop in births in the early 1980's.
But that has not translated into reduced applications and attendance at major colleges in those states.
Indiana University and the University of Kentucky have reported excellent application pools.
West Virginia's college-age population is expected to drop by 14 percent by 2008.
Five years ago, there were 11,000 students at the university; now there are 16,000.
The consumers of higher education have grown more sophisticated.
Today, applicants roam the World Wide Web, bargain over financial aid and apply to far away colleges.
The increased willingness of students to apply to colleges at the other end of the country is a reflection of the nation's increased prosperity.
Parents have more money to spend, and colleges have far more money to offer in scholarships.

The feud has taken a turn for the worse in recent months, following the capture of the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Mr. Ocalan, who is reviled in Turkey as a terrorist responsible for thousands of deaths, was found to have been living under the protection of Greek diplomats in Kenya.
Turkish leaders accused Greece of supporting a mass murderer in an effort to sow chaos in Turkey.

If Turks are outraged by Greece's role in protecting Mr. Ocalan, Greece also has a new focus for its anger.
Turkish leaders have begun asserting that there are political ''gray zones'' in the Aegean Sea, suggesting that Turkey has designs on islands that have long been considered Greek.
Dozens of interviews in both countries suggest that the animosity between these neighbors is fed by a combination of prejudice and political competition.
But they also revealed hope that a more positive relationship might emerge out of the current trouble.
''Whenever I am in Greece, what strikes me is how alike we are,'' said Orhan Taylan, a Turkish painter who is a member of a small Greek-Turkish friendship group.
''We have the same emotions, we tell the same jokes, we eat the same food, we listen to the same music, we look at the world the same way.
That's what makes it so awful that this conflict just keeps dragging on.''
Studying the psychology of Greek-Turkish relations is a passion for the historian Hercules Millas, who was born to Greek parents in Istanbul and considers himself at home in both countries.
''Neither side has any empathy with the other or any doubt that it is 100 percent right,'' Mr. Millas said.
''The Turk you know personally may be good, but the Turkish nation as a whole is a brutal and warlike enemy.
For Turks, Greeks are liars, full of intrigues and bad intentions, definitely not to be trusted.''
Turkey has nearly six times the population of Greece, a much more powerful army and a crucial location that makes it a highly desirable ally.
Greece is more developed and widely considered more democratic, but Turkey has far greater strategic value.
H ISTORY plays a great role in creating the suspicions that infect the Greek-Turkish relationship.
These may be the only two countries in the world that fought their definitive wars of liberation against each other.
A few isolated rays of light have fallen on the Greek-Turkish relationship in the quarter-century since the Cyprus operation, but they have not been enough to brighten the darkness that has come to envelop it.
The nations have come to the brink of war several times, most recently over a barren Aegean islet in 1996.
Their naval units still conduct maneuvers in the Aegean at the same time, and their pilots routinely engage in mock dogfights.
The suspicion that many ordinary Greeks and Turks harbor for each other is fed by a remarkable lack of contact.
There is little trade between the two nations.
Greeks and Turks rarely visit each other's countries, and very few speak the other's language.

Turkish leaders insist they can begin no dialogue with Greece until the Greek Government closes what they say are camps used to train Kurdish guerrillas in Greece and declares the guerrilla group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, a terrorist organization.
But Foreign Minister Papandreou insisted in an interview that there are no guerrilla camps in Greece, and that his Government is not prepared to label the PKK terrorist.
T HE PKK is not a legal organization in Greece and is not allowed to exist here,'' Mr. Papandreou said.
''We do not say that it is or is not a terrorist group.
I think it's putting a blindfold on the problem to say that this is only a problem of terrorism.''
In the days following Mr. Ocalan's capture in Kenya last February, Greece was shaken by a political earthquake.
Their successors, including Mr. Papandreou, are considered strong supporters of the relatively moderate Prime Minister, Constantine Simitis, and less likely to embark on provocative adventures like sheltering a man who is the most wanted fugitive in a nearby country.
''We're beginning to come out of the worst of it not only unscathed, but with some very positive changes,'' said Theodore Couloumbis, director of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy.
''We're leaving behind this idea that the enemy of our enemy is our friend, which got us into this huge mess in the first place.''
Turkish anger over Greece's support for Mr. Ocalan has not faded, however, and the victory of nationalist parties in Turkey's April election may have made compromise more difficult.
One of the elder statesmen of Greek politics, Minister of Defense Apostolos Tsohatzopoulos, is among those who hope that the shock of the Ocalan affair will lead to a new dialogue.
''I see it as a chance to change the bad perceptions that exist.''

By disclosing more information about bad loans than is customary in Japan, Fuji has since managed to persuade investors that it is in no worse -- and perhaps better -- shape than other Japanese banks.
Its stock price has rallied.
Japan's system of lifetime employment also is changing, albeit slowly.
Fuji is trying to cut its payroll through attrition, not layoffs, but Mr. Hashimoto said it is changing its pay structure to reward accomplishment rather than seniority.
Fuji also has a new system of hiring in place in which some people are hired on terms that pay them more but offer no guarantee of job security.
''The old system and the new system will coexist,'' he said.
He seems to hope that some workers who are passed over for raises will choose to quit.
Skeptics about Japan note that there have been false springs before.
This time is likely to be different because growth now reflects surprisingly strong domestic spending, not the old strategy of boosting exports.
This is ''a home-grown Japanese recovery,'' says Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company.
It is also a recovery based on old-fashioned stimulus.
The Government ramped up public spending and cut interest rates as low as they could go.
Japan has not proved it can grow when such stimuli are removed, but restructurings like the one under way at Fuji provide good reason to hope that it can.
Last year the Federal Reserve, fearing that Asia's illness would infect America, cut interest rates three times.
Now, with Asia on the mend and some signs of inflation at home, the Fed is all but certain to rescind one of those cuts.
It may rightly choose to take back two of them.
That would surprise Wall Street, and show that the Fed is determined to resist inflation.
Mr. Greenspan has been an advocate of the view that technology has helped improve the economy's ability to grow without inflation, but he has been distancing himself in recent months from the notion of a ''new economy'' in which inflation is no longer a threat.

The tone of his remarks was in line with that of other Fed officials over the last month in making clear that the central bank increasingly sees early signs of problems brewing in an economy that has enjoyed a remarkable run of growth.
Economists and investors expect Mr. Greenspan to provide a relatively unambiguous signal about his intentions when he testifies about monetary policy before the committee on Thursday, a day after the Government releases figures on consumer price inflation in May.
Mr. Greenspan was the first witness at the hearings, which the Joint Economic Committee is conducting in part to discuss such issues as tax breaks for research and development and the liability of technology companies for problems involving the Year 2000 software problem.
The witnesses include William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, who will appear on Tuesday.
But the hearings also seem intended to give the Republican majority in Congress an opportunity to give a sympathetic ear to the technology industry, one of the most important battlegrounds in the fight between the parties for campaign donations, and one that Vice President Al Gore has worked hard to sew up for his Presidential race.

In highlighting the Year 2000 liability issue, the Republicans are putting on display the uncomfortable situation of the Democrats, who are trapped between their desire to court technology companies that want protection from lawsuits and the Democrats' traditional alliance with trial lawyers, who want to protect the right of computer users to sue.
He reiterated his belief that technology has been perhaps the dominant force in the economy in recent years, fostering widespread changes in the way businesses operate and contributing tremendously to the vibrancy and durability of the expansion, which is now in its ninth year.
But with investors and economists looking for any clues about future rate increases, it was his warning about the limits of technology that was most provocative.
Many economists and investors expect the central bank to push its benchmark Federal funds target rate up by a quarter-point, to 5 percent, at the end of the month.
Evidence that the economy continues to roar along, including a surge last month in retail sales, has already pushed up the long-term interest rates set by the market in recent weeks, in effect doing some of the Fed's job for it by squeezing sectors of the economy sensitive to interest rates, like housing.
Although a Fed tightening is not certain -- there are still scant signs that inflation has taken root -- the markets are increasingly asking not whether the Fed will move this month but whether the move will be a one-time action or the start of a series of rate increases that would take back all of last fall's easings.

The Fed cut rates three times last fall, in quarter-point increments, to keep the markets stable and the economy humming despite the global financial crisis.
But the financial crisis, which originated in Asia, now seems to be receding.
A surprising rebound in economic growth in Japan during the first quarter -- provided it does not turn out to be a statistical fluke -- could prove to be an important turning point.
And the fear that gripped the credit markets last fall is all but gone, replaced by more concrete concern that inflation could stage a comeback.
Moreover, as Jack Guynn, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, put it today, the ''lucky streak'' that the United States has enjoyed on inflation ''has finally run out,'' at least to the degree that price increases have been held down by economic weakness in the rest of the world.
''Energy prices are up substantially from their year-ago levels, and other commodity prices have risen, too,'' Mr. Guynn said in a speech to a business group in Atlanta.
''What's happened, of course, is that as the economies of Asia and elsewhere have turned the corner to recovery, global demand has picked up, and so have prices.''
But he offered a list of issues that worry him, including ''the residual stimulus'' from last fall's rate cuts; signals that the bond market is increasingly concerned about inflation; rapid growth in the money supply, and the very low unemployment rate, which is 4.2 percent.

Mr. Milosevic still controls the crucial levers of power, namely the security forces, and does not look close to losing his grip.
But the Orthodox Church's call for his resignation has added to speculation about Mr. Milosevic's political future, when he is already damaged by the recent indictment from the international war crimes tribunal, and as he faces the end of his presidential term in 2001.
While only a small minority of Serbs practice religion, the church does bear some moral weight.
But the church's position represents the loss of an important portion of support for Mr. Milosevic.
The church expressed deep concern over what has happened in Kosovo, in particular the recent exodus of Serbs.
The church called on the international peacekeeping forces to provide protection to Serbian civilians and to the many Orthodox monasteries and churches there, including its ancient seat in Pec in western Kosovo.
''We also appeal to our brothers in Kosovo to stay in their homes and not to leave their relics, convinced in the truth of Jesus Christ's words that 'Those who endure till the end will be saved.'
''

Mr. Milosevic, who built his career on championing the Kosovo Serbs, has now dropped them unceremoniously.
More than 30,000 have fled their homes in the last four days, according to the Yugoslav Red Cross, and they have received barely a mention on state television.
Mr. Milosevic clearly feels the need to woo back the public to his side after the war, which at first drew the people behind him in patriotic fervor against NATO but which is now widely seen as disastrous for the country.

While many Serbs still blame NATO, opposition politicians are becoming more outspoken.

''Since Kosovo is now occupied we have no reason to remain in the Government,'' Mr. Seselj said, adding that one of the only reasons the Radical Party joined the Government had been to defend Kosovo Metohija, the province's full Serbian name.
If the Radical Party does leave the Government, it opens the way for changes.
Mr. Milosevic may invite the main democratic opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serb Renewal Party, to join.
Mr. Draskovic, in Mr. Milosevic's Government as Deputy Prime Minister for several months this year, said today that he would demand ''fundamental democratic reforms'' before joining the Government again.
''If they are not ready, and are ready to continue with their wrong policy of leading Serbia to disaster, the majority of Serbs would not allow that,'' he said at a news conference here.
Mr. Draskovic instead attacked the powerful Yugoslav Prime Minister, Momir Bulatovic, who he says should be replaced.
It may suit the Yugoslav President to shuffle his Government.
He may try to use politicians like Mr. Draskovic, and the President of the republic of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, to court Western aid and investment to help rebuild Serbia.
A change may also appease the public, facing a grim next six months of economic hardship, with shortages of electricity, heat and jobs.
Since Mr. Milosevic's term ends next year, and unless he changes the rules, he is not permitted to run again, after two consecutive terms as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
He may be tempted to call early elections and change the rules, analysts say, although that would be expensive and risky.
He is also hampered by the situation in Kosovo, since many of his party seats were won there.
It is unlikely that Kosovo will participate in national elections soon and Mr. Milosevic can no longer count on its strong support.

Payday lending companies are sprouting up all over the country, having increased to nearly 8,000 today from 300 seven years ago.
Although this is most prosperous peacetime decade of the century, many workers have become trapped by debts run up in free spending or have been driven deeper into debt by misfortune.
But these workers have the two basic things needed to obtain a payday loan: paychecks and checking accounts.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Although plentiful in big cities like New York and Los Angeles, the payday lenders have become most visible in places like Kokomo; Springfield, Ohio, and Cleveland, Tenn.
Ten have opened in Kokomo, a city of 45,000 people.
Bearing names like Check Into Cash, Check 'n Go and Fast Cash, payday lenders grant loans to workers against their next paychecks.
In return, the companies charge a ''fee,'' typically $15 to $35.
At annual rates, the fees normally exceed 300 percent and 400 percent and in some cases they reach four digits.
At least a dozen national chains have sprung up.
The biggest, Ace Cash Express in Irving, Tex., has around 900 stores and revenue last year -- what it collected in loan fees -- of $100 million, twice that of 1996.
In much of the country, these companies escape the routine scrutiny and regulation faced by banks, finance companies and pawn shops, because in some states they are too new to have stirred much controversy and in others they have used political clout to stave off legislation.
As of late last year, the Consumer Federation of America reported that 19 states, including all of those in New England, as well as Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, prohibited payday lending, most by limiting annual, small-loan interest to less than 40 percent.
A spokesman for the New York State Banking Department, Rick Hansen, disputed this assertion, saying the state's usury law forbids charging more than 25 percent annual interest on any loan.
The payday lenders say they are providing a vital service.
As commercial banks have shunned the poorest borrowers, in part by raising the minimum amounts they will lend, people who need small sums to get over a hump, like paying for a medical prescription or buying tires for a car, have few choices.
These include people who are unable to get credit cards or who have charged or exceeded their cards' credit limits.
Industry leaders say comparing payday lenders' fees with annual interest rates is unfair because most of the loans are paid off within a month.

Consumer advocates consider the interest rates exorbitant.
''I know of loan sharks in New York who wouldn't charge this kind of interest,'' said Gary L. Calhoun, a lawyer here who provides legal services for members of the United Automobile Workers.
State Representative Richard W. Bodiker of Indiana, a Democrat whose bill this year to regulate the lenders fell to intense industry lobbying, calls the fees ''in excess of what usury laws consider loan-sharking.''
''No major direct deposit provider has been convicted of that.''
One reason for the lenders' growth is people's comfort with debt.
The nation's savings rate, the percentage of people's disposable income that is saved, dropped to 0.5 percent last year and to nothing at all by earlier this year from 6 percent a decade ago.
Rather than save, people are spending more than ever and borrowing more than ever.
''We know there's a pretty sizable group of folks whose credit cards are maxed out,'' said Mark B. Tarpey, a supervisor in the consumer finance division of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions.
With payday lenders around, Mr. Tarpey said: ''They don't have to tell the boss they need a cash advance.
They don't have to give up their TV's and furniture.
They don't have to run a credit check.''
Another reason is a level of unemployment, 4.2 percent, that economists used to call unattainable.
To succeed, payday lenders need customers with bank accounts and regular checks, in particular paychecks, and these days, just about every able-bodied adult receives one.

Under such conditions, said Mr. Rochford, the deputy counsel for the check cashers' association, payday lenders' revenues will grow to $1.44 billion this year from $810 million last year.
Payday lending exists, Mr. Rochford said, ''because there's a need for it.''
A short-term deferred deposit loan, the industry's preferred term, helps a worker through an emergency and is cheaper than bouncing a check.
Most banks do not make loans for less than $1,000, he said, and pawning is embarrassing.
Borrowers like a payday loan, Mr. Rochford said, because ''it is private,'' adding: ''It is quick.
And they do not need a lot of documentation.''
The fees cover loans that turn sour, he said, and the cost of employees to process loans.
Kokomo, about 50 miles north of Indianapolis, may be a case in point.
A steel and asphalt city of immense new Daimler-Chrysler and Delphi-Delco automobile component factories, Kokomo is fertile terrain for payday lending.

Strapped by bad credit and unmanageable or unexpected expenses, people here used to go to pawn shops for loans.
But of three pawn shops here two years ago, one has closed, and another, Bob's, passed up renewing its license this month.
Now people go to the city's new payday lenders.
Unemployment, which has exceeded 20 percent in Kokomo in recessions, was just 1.4 percent in March, according to the latest survey by the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University.
About 20,000 people, roughly 40 percent of the area work force, is employed by automotive companies.
They earn $50,000 to $60,000 a year and are the new lenders' biggest customers.
The payday lenders here approve most loans within 10 minutes.
''No Credit Check, Instant Approval,'' Easy Money's flier promises.
For this service, some states specify a maximum fee of $15 on a one- or two-week loan of $100 or $200.
In Indiana the limit is $33.
At $33, the annual rate on a two-week $100 loan is 858 percent.
And as borrowers amass loans, taking new ones to pay the fees on the others, the fastest way to payday becomes a fast way, too, to garnished wages and bankruptcy.

Kathy Jo King, 41, earns almost $60,000 a year as an assembly-line worker at the Daimler-Chrysler transmission plant.
But she has no savings, in part because she is paying creditors $113 a week to work her way out of a bankruptcy that followed a serious automobile accident that left her husband partly disabled and both with high medical bills.
Then early last year, Ms. King and her husband and their boys, 18 and 11, had to move, incurring $1,500 in unexpected expenses.
''I've got kids to feed,'' she said.
With her credit in ruins, she could not go to a bank for a loan, so she went to payday lenders.
''They make you feel real at ease about it.''
So one lender tried to redeem her last $330 check covering a loan of $300 and a fee of $30.
With the $80 for bouncing the check, Ms. King owes $1,280 on her original loan of $330.
Currently, about 100 payday lender suits against borrowers are on file in the Howard County Superior Court in Kokomo.
Lenders here also send out letters threatening customers with imprisonment for bouncing a loan check, although none is known to have tested the state penal code provision that they invoke in making the threat.
Some lenders start taking legal action within a month to obtain unpaid loans; others try to work with customers to avoid a lawsuit.
Ms. Brenner now has 350 clients and charges less than most lenders: $20 for a two-week $100 loan, for an annual percentage rate of 521 percent, and $30 for $200, or 391 percent.

Unlike some lenders, Ms. Brenner lets her clients pay off portions of their loans as they extend them and in that way work them down.
And to avert probable trips to small-claims court, she says she will not lend to people who already have more than two loans from other payday lenders.
The biggest borrowers, many lenders say, are not Kokomo's low-wage service workers, but auto industry employees who earn more than $20 an hour.
''Most of my customers are from Chrysler and Delco,'' said Marc Sutherland, manager of the Kokomo office of Nationwide Budget Finance.
Shari Harris, 39, who earns around $25,000 a year as an information security analyst, was managing money well enough until the father of her two children, 10 and 4, stopped paying $1,200 a month in child support.
She qualified immediately for a two-week $150 loan at Check Into Cash, handing it a check for $183 to include the $33 fee.
''That's the sickness of it,'' Ms. Harris said.
So she asked her employer to stop paying her wages into her checking account, emptying it, and putting her checks into a savings account.
She took a second job, working in a department store, and turned to the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, which worked out a plan under which she is paying $440 a month to work down the loans.
Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America and a prominent critic of payday lending, said, ''There's nothing wrong with small loans at reasonable interest rates, reasonable terms and reasonable collection practices.

''But these practices are designed to keep you in perpetual debt.''
And while the payment will close the books on the original investors' experience, it is not clear how this drama will end for the fund's rescuers, some of Wall Street's largest institutions, and for its founding partners, who are already discussing forming a new money-management venture.

The hedge fund, founded in mid-1994 by a bond-market star, John W. Meriwether of Salomon Brothers, seemed to be touched by magic in its first three years of operation, enhancing Mr. Meriwether's already formidable reputation and generating wealth for his partners, who included two Nobel Prize-winning economists.
But in August, a debt crisis in Russia set off a worldwide scramble for the safety of United States Treasury securities, distorting interest-rate patterns.
Consequently, officials at the New York Federal Reserve Bank helped 14 banks and brokerage houses form a consortium to make an emergency $3.6 billion investment in the fund.
Under the plan the rescuers got a 90 percent stake in the fund, reducing the original outside investors' stake to just under 10 percent, with Mr. Meriwether and the other managing partners retaining only a tiny sliver of equity.

Since then, markets have stabilized, and the fund has steadily reduced the riskiness of its holdings and improved its investment results.
In addition to cashing out the original investors, the fund will also be making a partial payment to the consortium that bailed it out in September.

One person who knows about the plan said that somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million would be distributed to the consortium, which includes the Bankers Trust Corporation, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, Goldman Sachs Group, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Merrill Lynch & Company, J. P. Morgan & Company, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, and Citigroup, along with six European banks.
Not everyone involved with the hedge fund will fare as well as the original investors, who included top Wall Street executives, as well as a unit of the Bank of Italy.
Various Merrill Lynch executives in that company's deferred compensation plan began tying their future earnings to the then-impressive hedge fund's results in April 1998 -- rather like boarding the Titanic just in time for the iceberg collision.
They missed the handsome cash distributions, and apparently will suffer the full damage of the subsequent meltdown.
Of course, Mr. Meriwether and the other founding partners of Long-Term Capital also saw their equity in the fund virtually evaporate in the course of last fall's rescue.
But the damage done to the bank accounts and professional reputations of the founding partners does not seem to have dissolved the glue that binds them to Mr. Meriwether.
People who have been told the contents of E-mail that has circulated at the fund's offices in Greenwich say that at least five of Mr. Meriwether's original colleagues from the Salomon Brothers bond desk -- Eric Rosenfeld, Lawrence Hilibrand, Richard Leahy, Victor Hagani and Arjun Krishnamachar -- have agreed to join him in exploring the possibility of forming some new investment venture within the next six to 12 months.
It is likely that this new venture will be approaching potential sources of investment capital later this year, these people said.
Among those who will not be joining Mr. Meriwether's faithful band will be David W. Mullins Jr., who quit as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve to become a partner in Long-Term Capital.
Two other jewels in Mr. Meriwether's crown, the Nobel laureate economists Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, have already left the fund.

For Many, Drug Testing Is Becoming Medical Care

In recent years, the need for test subjects in experimental drug trials has exploded as the industry has brought to market an ever-increasing number of new products.
In response, drug companies have developed new methods of finding participants for the trials by turning to private-practice doctors who recruit from their lists of patients.
But even that influx of participants has not been enough to satisfy the demand.
Filling the gap, according to industry officials and researchers, are chronically ill patients with limited or no health insurance who rely on clinical trials as their primary source of medical care.
For these people, experiments have become treatments.

Although stock traders appear to have accepted that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point next week, Christopher Durbin, chief investment strategist at J. P. Morgan Investment Inc., which manages more than $300 billion, said the central bank would most likely have to increase rates much more than that to slow the economy.
At a luncheon with reporters in New York yesterday, Mr. Durbin said short-term interest rates would probably rise a full percentage point over the next year.
Traders said the rise in long-term interest rates yesterday was caused by positioning in front of a heavy calendar of coming corporate debt issues.
And the rising rates probably did not help brokerage stocks.

JEFF VAN GUNDY walked out on the news media at yesterday's shoot-around after getting fed up with a squabble that was going on between a reporter and a television cameraman while he was trying to speak.
''Can't we all get along?''
Then, when the cameraman yanked a tape recorder out of the reporter's hand, Van Gundy said: ''You know what; I'm done.

''I feel such an inner peace whenever I listen to him talk, so I never miss a chance to see him or hear him,'' said Sebastiana Pereira de Souza, 46, a fruit vendor, who says she has also bought several copies of Father Rossi's record to give to friends.
''He transmits the word of God with such tenderness, like an angel who has descended among us.''

Perhaps even more than other Latin American countries, Brazil has a long tradition of popular religiosity focused on charismatic figures.
Father Rossi may be another expression of that tendency, but he ''speaks to a very different audience in a very different way,'' said Ralph della Cava, an expert on religion in Brazil who teaches at Queens College in New York.
''He addresses a largely urban audience of young people in a world permeated by secular values, proposing a set of alternative values through the medium that has always been the most important in Brazil, the popular music of the day.''
His emergence is also notable because of where it occurs.
Under Paulo Evaristo Cardinal Arns in the 1970's and 80's, the Catholic Church here in Brazil's largest city was a stronghold of liberation theology, a blend of Catholic and Marxist doctrine that Pope John Paul II has sought to discourage.
After serving a year in the Brazilian Army, he became an instructor at an exercise academy here, spending much of his income, he said, on body-building supplements and equipment intended to bulk up his 6-foot-4 athlete's frame.

Even today, traces of Father Rossi's days in the gym can be detected in the way he celebrates Mass.
As he sings rock-flavored tunes like ''Angels of God'' and ''I Breathe,'' he waves his arms and and kneels and jumps about with an energy and fervor that recall James Brown in his prime, inviting the faithful to do the same, and afterward, he often leads the congregation in a session of what he calls ''the Lord's aerobics.''
''Before, the music you heard in church was enough to put you to sleep,'' said Antonio Carlos de Oliveira, 57, an automobile worker who attends three of Father Rossi's services each week.
''But not now.
The prayers are songs, so you feel better and you are also participating.
It's good for your health and good for your soul.''

As his popularity and influence have grown, though, Father Rossi has also drawn detractors.
Fundamentalist Protestant ministers, who have made significant inroads in Brazil in recent years, complain vociferously that he has copied their preaching style and even their musical repertory.
Liberation theology advocates within the Roman Catholic Church here have criticized him too, though mostly indirectly.
''The Eucharist is not a show,'' Msgr.
Pedro Casaldaliga, the combatively progressive bishop of Sao Felix do Araguaia in the Amazon, said when asked about Father Rossi's approach.
''What frightens me is to see a pop star priest,'' Frei Betto, one of the leading theoreticians of liberation theology, wrote in a recent essay addressed to Father Rossi.
He added that, rather than appearing on television, ''I prefer to appear among the excluded, on the periphery, among the landless and homeless.''
Still, Father Rossi maintained, over the years liberation theology has led to ''a certain exaggeration of the social pastoral at the expense of the Mass.''
And while ''the church has to give preference to the poor, that must be done without excluding others,'' he added.
''We need to seek an equilibrium.''
There is also a more traditionalist faction within the church that, as Dr. della Cava put it, sees Father Rossi's approach as ''not intellectual enough, as fun-and-games, short-cut Christianity that panders to popular opinion.''
To those conservative critics, Father Rossi replies that what he is doing is merely using music to glorify the word of God, just as his predecessors did centuries ago with Gregorian chants.
And with a grin, he buttresses his position with a citation from St. Augustine: ''He who sings prays twice.''

The three buildings already under construction include the 100,000-square-foot Gateway 100 in Woodbury, renting for $27.50 a square foot, which the Tilles Companies of Woodbury expects to complete by December; the 100,000-square-foot Three Greenway Plaza in Melville being built by Greenway Plaza Office Park and renting for $26 a square foot, to be completed in September, and Fortunato Development's 60,000-square-foot One Corporate Drive in Bohemia, which is renting for $22 a square foot and is also to be ready for occupancy in September.

Two additional projects -- one in Melville and the other in Hauppauge -- are expected to break ground before the end of the year.
The Tritec Real Estate Company of East Setauket is awaiting final approvals from the Town of Smithtown, but hopes to start by the fall on a 408,000-square-foot two-building complex at 100 Motor Parkway in Hauppauge.
Tilles also expects to start a three-building complex in Melville with 520,000 square feet before the end of the year.
At the Hauppauge project, annual rents will start at $29 a square foot; in Tilles's Melville project, they will be $28 a foot.
Both projects will be built in phases.
Large blocks of existing space are also coming on the market, notably 600,000 square feet in two buildings in Jericho being vacated by the Chase Manhattan Bank in the next two years, and the 209,000-square-foot former Long Island Savings Bank building at 201 Old Country Road in Melville.
A partnership of the Parr Organization of Ronkonkoma and Pitcairn Properties of Jenkinstown, Pa., is in contract to purchase the Melville building and will subdivide it.
Even with so much new space in the pipeline, brokers say they do not foresee a glut.
The current overall vacancy rate for Class A office space -- larger, newer buildings with amenities and in good locations -- on Long Island is 6.3 percent.
With the current vacancy rate so low, said Theodore J. Stratigos, a senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield of Long Island, ''we may see a 2 percent rise when these buildings come on line but we could afford a 5 percent increase and not have problems.''
He added that it was ''very good that we finally have some new buildings going up.''
''Competition creates another reason for a tenant to expand or relocate to Long Island because it gives tenants opportunities and options,'' said Gus P. Nuzzolese, senior executive director at Sutton & Edwards, commercial brokers in Lake Success.
''We like to have an inventory of about two years and based on the last two years' absorption rate, these buildings will be fitting into this scheme perfectly.''
Richard Karson, director at the Syosset office of Insignia/ESG, said that Tilles, Reckson and Tritec were ''all responding to the problem of where are they going to put their tenants as they grow.''
The building, called Melville Square, ''was the springboard for us going forward on the new project.''

One of Melville Square's new tenants will be Merrill Lynch, which now occupies 18,000 square feet at Reckson's building at 200 Broadhollow Road, but needed more space.
It will move to 30,000 square feet in Melville Square on Sept. 2, adding 30 people to its sales force of 40.

Other landlords also say their new buildings are drawing many of their own tenants.
''We have two or three tenants who want to consolidate the space they have and grow, and the only way they can do that with us is in the new building,'' said Roger Tilles, one of the principals of Tilles, which owns 3.5 million square feet of industrial and office space in Woodbury.
Mr. Tilles said he was talking to several tenants ''who would more than fill the building,'' if the deals go through.
(Traditionally, tenants are reluctant to sign a lease in a new building until construction is substantially complete.)
Fortunato Development has one signed tenant -- the Long Island Sports & Rehabilitation Center, which is taking 10,000 square feet -- but three additional tenants whose leases are not yet signed would together take 35,000 square feet, said Paul T. Fortunato, the company's real estate manager.
The developer's Airport Corporate Center in Bohemia, which contains two additional buildings with 200,000 square feet, is fully leased, Mr. Fortunato said.
One of the prospective tenants for the new building is Routemaster.com, a company that provides integrated Internet-based business solutions to the freight transportation industry.
It will be vacating 5,000 square feet at Airport Corporate Plaza and taking 14,000 square feet in the new building, which will serve as the new headquarters for the two-year-old company, said its chairman, Kenneth L. Miller.
The company plans to relocate with 40 employees by December.
''If it weren't for the new building, we would strongly consider moving out of state because I could easily operate elsewhere,'' Mr. Miller said.
Landlords without new space to offer say they face full occupancy but no space for tenants who want to grow.

''You really need inventory in order to attract companies to Long Island and to keep the economy healthy and moving along,'' said David Pennetta, executive director of Oxford & Simpson, commercial brokers in Jericho.
''We have many entrepreneurial companies, and a company in 10,000 square feet today may be in 200,000 square feet five years from now.''
''By bringing trophy buildings on line, we can demonstrate that we stand on our own and have our own economic hub here,'' he said.
Developers say everything seems to point to a positive outcome for their new crop of buildings.
''The Long Island office market from what we can see is stronger than ever and will be at least for the next two years, interest rates are still good, rents are moving up, the economy is tremendous and diversified,'' said Bob J. Coughlan, the co-managing partner of Tritec.
The Pitcairn-Parr partnership, which is renovating the former Long Island Savings Bank building in Melville, already has a major Long Island company about to sign a lease for 32,000 of the 205,000 square feet, with options for an additional 68,000 feet.
''We have 10 additional prospects all looking in the 20,000-square-foot range,'' said Ronald Parr, the president of the Parr Organization.
''Do I think all the new construction is needed?
Yes, and then some because we have so many people coming to us, we can't accommodate them all.''
The tale of Hingis, the century's youngest No.
1 when she was 16 and Wimbledon's youngest champion in 1997, has devolved into a sob story in 1999.
Hingis, now 18, seems to have come into her adolescent rebellion belatedly, and so far she and her results are suffering for it.

Her verbal outbursts have included a derogatory reference to Amelie Mauresmo, runner-up to her in the Australian Open, as ''half a man'' after she announced her lesbianism there; a description of Jana Novotna, her discarded doubles partner and Wimbledon's defending singles and doubles champion, as ''old and slow,'' and a snide remark about Steffi Graf being over the hill in a game populated by a group Hingis likes to call the Spice Girls of Tennis.
Under close scrutiny by the British press, as well as officials of the WTA Tour, was Dokic's father, Damir, who introduced himself to the limelight three weeks ago by getting thrown out of the Edgbaston event for causing a ruckus.
But Damir Dokic, who recently dismissed Lester Bowrey, the Australian Fed Cup captain, as his daughter's coach and tennis confidant, has been given the tabloid label ''the tennis father from hell.''
He seems to be replacing the parent of another of Wimbledon 1999's emergent teens.
Lucic has since accused her father of physically and emotionally abusive conduct and has cut all ties to him.
Now 17 and based at the Bollettieri Sports Academy in Bradenton, Fla., Lucic is making a comeback after settling her domestic woes and hiring a coach, Joe Giuliano, skilled in the art of constructive, not destructive, criticism.

Stevenson's Wimbledon idyll has not been free of controversies, generated by remarks made by her mother during impromptu news conferences.
According to Samantha Stevenson, a freelance sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times as well as other publications, Alexandra, who is black, has been subjected to racist remarks and a general lack of respect by opponents on the WTA Tour.
The Stevensons are also in a dispute with the tour, which maintains that Alexandra -- who decided to turn pro for this tournament -- entered the tournament as an amateur and is not entitled to prize money.
Samantha Stevenson says that she informed the tournament committee at the Wimbledon qualifying tournament about Alexandra's intent to turn pro.
in order to follow in the footprints of her role models Venus and Serena Williams.
''I will be ready with my serve-and-volley game and forehand; I'm taking it one match at a time and looking one step forward.
I'm in the moment.''
For the moment, they all are.
One recent piece of evidence suggesting a strong human influence, which seems likely to carry some weight with the intergovernmental panel, appeared recently in the journal Nature.
Scientists at the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research, a British Government organization, analyzed the global climate record of the last century in an effort to isolate and quantify the major factors producing the century's rise of about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the earth's average surface temperature.

The research team led by Dr. Simon F. B. Tett found that in the earlier part of the century, the rise could be explained either by an increase in solar radiation or a combination of stronger solar radiation and heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted by industrial economies.
Other researchers have lately come to a similar conclusion.
The Tett study represents ''another jigsaw puzzle piece,'' said one expert, Dr. Tom M. L. Wigley of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ''There is still a long way to go'' in completing the puzzle, he said, ''but we're beginning to see the smile on the face of the Mona Lisa, I think -- or perhaps it should be a frown.''
Dr. Wigley was a principal author of the section of the intergovernmental panel's 1995 report dealing with detection of the human imprint on climate, but not for the new report.
One, Dr. Michael E. Schlesinger, a climatologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says that experts have insufficient knowledge of the magnitude of natural climatic variations, especially solar radiation, to gauge how large the human impact is by comparison.
Another, Dr. Ronald Prinn of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that although there was ''accumulating evidence that humans are having an influence on the climate system,'' it would not be possible to discern its magnitude until the degree of natural climate variability could be pinned down better.
Meanwhile, though, evidence of warming and its effects continues to mount.
This and other analyses have found that the warmest years of all occurred in the 1990's, with 1998 the warmest on record.
El Nino, the great pool of warm water in the tropical Pacific Ocean that from time to time heats the atmosphere and disrupts weather patterns, was responsible for some of the 1998 heating.
A preliminary analysis by Dr. Wigley, however, has shown that when El Nino's effects are filtered out of the global temperature record statistically, 1998 still ranks as the warmest year.
(This year is also shaping up as unusually warm, but not as warm as 1998.)
Two studies reported in Nature this month suggest that the warming is being reflected in patterns of wildlife behavior and distribution.
In one study, Dr. Camille Parmesan, a biologist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis in Santa Barbara, Calif., and 12 colleagues analyzed distribution patterns of 35 species of European butterflies.

In the other study, Humphrey Q.
They found that, again coincident with a recent warming trend, the birds were laying their eggs earlier in the spring.
This is the latest in a series of studies indicating that meteorological spring is coming earlier in the Northern Hemisphere.
Some have also shown that fall is coming later.
A third study in Nature this month reports, on the basis of bubbles of atmospheric gas contained in ice cores extracted from the Antarctic ice sheet, that present-day atmospheric levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide are higher than at any other time in the last 420,000 years.
At 360 parts per million, they are 20 percent higher than in any previous warm period between ice ages, and double the typical concentrations during an ice age.

If greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, the United Nations scientific panel has consistently said, atmospheric concentrations will continue to rise and warm the earth further.
The warming would not end in 2100, the panel found, but would continue.
By comparison, the earth has warmed by 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age some 20,000 years ago.
The amount of warming projected by the panel, it said, would create widespread climatic and ecological changes, including a shift in climatic zones, an increase in heat waves, warmer northern winters, increased precipitation when it rains but worse droughts when it does not, and a rise in sea level that could inundate many small island nations and drive tens of millions of people away from the coasts when storm surges develop.
For a long time, the global warming debate focused on how much warming a given increase in greenhouse gases -- say, a doubling of atmospheric concentrations -- would produce.
Though skeptics say it would be small, the dominant view for 20 years has been that a doubling would produce a warming of 3 to 8 degrees, other things being equal.
This is a measure of the climate system's sensitivity to ''forcing,'' as experts call it, by external heating and cooling influences, and many mainstream scientists say confidence that it is right has grown.
Now attention is shifting to the relative strength of the external forcings.
This is the crux of the problem of figuring out the magnitude of humans' influence on the climate.
There are basically three main forcings: greenhouse gases and solar radiation, which warm the atmosphere, and sulfate droplets, or aerosols, from both volcanoes and industrial sources, which cool it.
The amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been firmly established and continuously monitored, though it is difficult if not impossible to predict how much there will be in the future.
Once greenhouse gases diffuse throughout the entire lower part of the atmosphere they remain there for decades to centuries.
Sulfate aerosols from volcanoes sometimes spread to the stratosphere, where they, too, diffuse globally and cool the earth.
But they dissipate in two or three years.
Sulfate aerosols from industry generally rise only into the lower part of the atmosphere and fall out, as acid rain, within a few days.
Moreover, their extent and impact is mostly regional rather than global.
Until recently, they affected primarily the industrial countries of Europe and North America, but scientists now believe that they are diminishing in that part of the world because of controls on pollution.
They are growing fast, however, in India, China and Southeast Asia.

Experts have difficulty in getting a handle on the constantly shifting amounts and patterns of industrial aerosols, and they have a similarly hard time establishing the varying strength of solar radiation.
Some mainstream scientists say that because the earth's average surface temperature has not varied by more than a degree or two since the last ice age, variations in the strength of the sun's radiation must be relatively small during the present interglacial period.
Satellite measurements show some small variations, less than one-tenth of a percent, in concert with the 11-year sunspot cycle.
But for the years before 1978, when satellite measurements began, scientists must estimate the variations from proxy indicators like sunspots.
These estimates say that solar irradiance did not increase by more than 1 percent from 1908 to 1952.
In the recent Tett study, the British scientists fed into a computer model of the climate system varying estimates, based on different proxy studies, of past solar irradiance.
They also fed in the observed and estimated changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols from both volcanoes and industrial sources.
Since the 1970's, the simulations revealed, global warming cannot be explained without a large impact from greenhouse gases.
Dr. Schlesinger, the University of Illinois climatologist, says he has ''a couple of problems'' with the study.
First, he says, the data on solar variability before 1978 are unreliable.
Second, the climate system's natural internal variability, apart from external forcings, is quite large relative to the observed warming and has not been well quantified.
For example, he says, there is a growing body of evidence that the warming in the early part of the century resulted from a natural oscillation in the surface temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean.
The larger point, Dr. Schlesinger says, is that the climate system's internal variations may be so large that they render the Tett findings' statistical significance weaker.
Nonetheless, Dr. Tett says he believes the findings strengthen the United Nations panel's 1995 conclusion about a human impact on climate.
The struggle to gauge that impact goes on.
''The important question,'' Dr. Prinn says, ''is numbers'' -- precise estimates of the relative weight of natural and human factors.
''It could be there are big environmental issues involved here,'' he says, ''or relatively modest ones.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell below 6 percent, closing at 5.96 percent.

In fact, a continued rise in stock prices could offset the slowing effect of today's increase and could prompt the Fed to raise rates even more.
Its quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate could lead to an increase in loan rates for businesses and consumer credit like auto and home-equity loans.
But interest rates that are set directly or indirectly in the financial markets, like those on mortgages and corporate bonds, will depend on whether investors think the likelihood of further rate increases has been diminished and that inflation is no threat.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has warned over the last several months that although there is almost no inflation, there is an increasing risk that continued robust growth could push wages and then prices into an upward spiral.
Market interest rates had been moving higher over the last several months in anticipation of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, helping to cool off rate-sensitive sectors of the economy like housing.
But economic indicators have given mixed signals in recent weeks about the prospects for slowing, and analysts said the Fed's shift to a neutral stance today was intended to say that the central bank would wait for more data before deciding how to proceed rather than that it was finished tightening monetary policy for the year.
''In the end the decision is going to be dependent on the economic environment.''
In explaining its decision, the Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee remained open to what has become known as the ''new age'' economic paradigm: that huge investments in computers and other technology have made businesses so much more efficient that the economy can run at much higher levels than in the past, and at lower rates of unemployment, without generating inflation.

''Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures,'' the committee said.
''Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the F.O.M.C.
has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action.''

The statement went on, however, to emphasize that the Fed's tolerance for strong growth and low unemployment has its limits.
''The committee nonetheless recognizes that in the current dynamic environment, it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that might undermine growth,'' the statement said.
Since the Fed cut rates three times last fall, the economy has grown, and the financial crisis that started in Asia and spread around the world has abated.
The central bank justified the rate increase today in those terms, saying ''the full degree'' of last fall's rate reductions is ''no longer necessary'' to keep financial markets well oiled and the economy in the United States on an even keel.
If history is any guide, the shift to a neutral policy stance, or bias, is no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates when it next meets on Aug. 24.
The central bank has traditionally moved back to a neutral bias after raising rates even when another rate increase seemed likely.
What is different this time around is that the Fed is disclosing its policy bias publicly after each meeting.
Whatever the Fed's intentions, the market's response today was to send stock prices higher, making consumers feel that much wealthier and willing to spend, and to bring down bond yields, providing a kick to the economy that could well offset whatever slowing effect the increase in official short-term rates accomplishes.
''In the process of making this announcement, the Fed has greatly reduced the odds that the economy is going to slow down,'' said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
''The fear of Greenspan has been removed from the financial markets.
That means the restrictiveness on the economy that had been put in place based on the expectation of higher rates has been removed.''
Investors could reassess their initial reaction in coming days, as they often do when it comes to the Fed's hints about policy.
But they are most likely to take their cue from key indicators of growth and inflation in coming weeks, starting with job creation and the unemployment rate for June on Friday.

Still, an array of politicians and business executives who had been pressing Mr. Greenspan to show restraint in slowing the economy given the absence of inflation took heart from the Fed's signals today.
''Given the dearth of inflation and strong but steady growth, today's decision was, in my judgment, an error, but a minor one,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, which has long argued that the economy's potential for noninflationary growth is much higher than the Fed recognizes.
''The metaphor suggesting that a little inflation is like the genie out of the bottle is simply wrong,'' Mr. Reich said.
''We know empirically that inflation can be stopped.
More to the point, the lag between when the Fed acts and the response in the economy is actually very small, because financial markets are extraordinarily efficient and respond very quickly.''
Overcoming an early stumble, stock prices climbed steadily yesterday to finish with sizable gains despite a rise in interest rates.
The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 1 8/32 to 89 20/32 .
''The stock and bond markets seem to be taking different views,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation.
Bond people, he said, are impressed by the fact that Federal Reserve rate increases are rarely one-shot exercises and that it was not all that encouraging that the Fed dropped its bias to tighten while raising rates Wednesday.
The Fed has traditionally done this, he added, albeit without an immediate announcement.

Stock market participants, on the other hand, were largely convinced, Mr. Ghriskey said, that the Fed was merely taking back an extra rate cut tied to global turmoil and that the economy would keep bounding ahead, as implied by the manufacturing figures released by the National Association of Purchasing Management.
There was no clear pattern in the day's brisk stock trading, however, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite rising 20.06 points, to close at 2,706.18, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 8.25 points, to close at 1,380.96.

''The market is reacting well'' to the week's economic reports and the Fed action, said Paul Rich, a trader at BT Brokerage.
''This is real positive, real institutional, too,'' he added, expressing confidence that the imminent start of the quarterly earnings-report season would give a further lift to stocks.
''Nobody can think of anything that's going to spoil the picnic,'' said Lawrence D. Cavanagh, an options specialist at Value Line.

He then began giving speeches on fighting cancer.
He fell in love with Lebanon while working there in the early 1960's as an accountant for a New York firm.

For their part, consumers are not quite so irresponsible as the savings figures suggest.
Although they are amassing debt, their overall financial condition is not deteriorating, in large part because the stock market boom and rising real estate values are making them wealthier, at least on paper, even if their cash flow is out of whack.
The technical definition of savings includes bank deposits and money invested in stocks, bonds or retirement savings -- basically any after-tax income that a consumer does not spend.
But it does not include the capital gains on investments or retirement plans.

Still, the contrast between promised Government rectitude and personal profligacy is jarring.
On the one hand, Mr. Clinton was making the case that one of the great benefits of fiscal responsibility and debt reduction is lower interest rates, since the Government's reduced borrowing needs leaves more capital available for businesses and consumers.
On the other, the Federal Reserve was raising rates to snuff out any smoldering inflationary pressures generated by an economy that is already red hot.
Making matters even more complicated, the updated surplus projections led Republicans to step up their push for a big tax cut, which if enacted would stoke the economy even as the Fed is trying to cool it off.
(To add to the conundrum, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is one of the most fervent advocates in Washington of lower taxes.
Congress is likely to heed his call for another cut in the capital gains tax, which would further fuel the turbo-charged stock market, whose lofty valuations have been keeping Mr. Greenspan awake at night for years.)
THERE'S good news, though.
These apparent quandaries are the interwoven byproducts of prosperity.
Take the issue of personal savings and national debt.
Arguably, the Government owes its opportunity to reduce the debt to consumers, who as much as any other force have kept the economy and the stock market steaming along and generating the flood of tax revenues that has transformed deficit into surplus.
To the degree that Americans are spendthrifts, it is because they are confident about their own prospects.
By opening their wallets, they are creating jobs and fomenting competition that leads to innovation and efficiency.
And while their credit card balances might be a bit steep, their household balance sheets are quite healthy if assets like stocks and houses are taken into account.
The ratio of household liabilities to net worth actually declined a bit between 1988 and 1998, to 16.7 percent from 16.9 percent, according to Federal Reserve figures assembled by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment firm based in London.
A negative savings rate is indeed a potential problem in the long run, and it is only one of several imbalances that have developed over the course of the long business expansion.
Should joblessness rise or the stock market head south, households might quickly find themselves on the financial precipice.
The same dynamic could apply to the rapidly growing trade deficit, which so far has been a symbol of the American economy's strength and its ability to absorb imports.
A downturn could expose the deficit as a weakness of serious proportions.
But even looking narrowly at the savings rate, the news there is not all bad.
While personal savings is in free fall, the overall national savings rate -- by far the more important economic indicator -- has been rising.
That is because the Government has become a ''saver'' in economic terms in the past few years as budget deficits have turned to surpluses and the Treasury has begun paying down the national debt.

Then there is the question of whether debt reduction is even the best way to use the fiscal windfall.
Mainstream economic thought says yes.
That position dovetails with the broad political consensus that a crucial component to shoring up the ailing entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, is getting the Government on sounder financial footing before the vast baby-boom generation retires.
BUT some conservatives say focusing on paying down the debt dilutes support for tax cuts, which they see as a far more potent way of stimulating additional growth.
Some liberals fear that concentrating on debt reduction will divert attention from needed investments in education, health care and poverty fighting, all issues essential to the country's long-term prospects.
Hanging over the debate is an even bigger question: Are the surpluses for real?
The answer is that nobody knows.
Today's fiscal optimism could prove equally transitory.
They have even been observed in recurring acts of infanticide.

Off Virginia, researchers found at least nine baby dolphins killed, their ribs broken, their skulls and vertebrae smashed.
One small body bore puncture marks matching the pattern of adult dolphin teeth.
''So finding evidence of violence is disturbing.''
More widely, scientists and Federal officials worry about dolphins' injuring or even killing humans, especially given the rise in watching, feeding and swimming programs.
''Wildlife can be dangerous,'' said Trevor R. Spradlin, a Federal dolphin expert.
''But people see marine mammals differently, particularly dolphins.
There's this misconception that they're friendly, that they're Flipper, that they want to play with people.''
Officials at the Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service, where Mr. Spradlin works, have begun an educational campaign that sends out brochures to marinas, schools and fairs in coastal areas where people and dolphins interact, urging caution and warning of peril.
''Dozens of bites have been reported,'' says one flier.
''And people have been pulled under water.
But she added, ''Just because dolphins have a smile doesn't mean they're nonaggressive.''
In the United States, dolphin commerce is loosely regulated, and many countries have no rules at all.
An American ban on feeding wild dolphins is routinely ignored by tour boats, which use food to lure dolphins nearby so people wearing masks and snorkels can swim among the creatures.
Revised rules are not expected until next year.

Many experts say tourist attractions will remain largely unfettered until a major accident occurs.
''They're big, wild animals,'' said Dr. Andrew J.
Read, a biologist at the Duke University Marine Laboratory who studies dolphin attacks.
''And people should respect them as such.''
Of course, dolphin savagery pales in comparison with the brutality of people, who have managed to kill millions of dolphins while fishing for tuna.
The dolphins, which breathe air, drown when large purse seine nets close over their heads.
Fishery reforms seek to limit the slaughter.
Closely related to whales, the 32 species that make up the dolphin family (Delphinidae in scientific nomenclature) include killer whales, which grow up to 30 feet long and are famous for their aggressive hunting pods.
But the rest are smaller.
The common dolphin is up to 7 feet long, and the bottlenose, up to 12 feet.
Many dolphins have a pronounced beak and all have a central dorsal fin and sharp teeth for feeding, mainly on squid and fish.
Significantly for humans, the mouths of many species turn upward in a perpetual grin.
As a result, the animals have long fascinated people.
Dolphins are highly social and appear to communicate among themselves with a wide range of clicks, whistles and beeps, though scientists who study them say they do not actually have a complex language.
Experts say dolphins are smarter than dogs and similar in intelligence to chimpanzees.
The new-age dolphin operations go much further.
In advertisements and tour promotions, they say dolphins are highly evolved spiritual beings.
The dolphin's mere glance is enlightening, they say.
''Dolphins reach deep into our souls, opening the door to our hearts,'' Marie-Helene Roussel said in an advertisement for her Delphines Center, which is on the Web at www.dolphinswim.com.
Anyone with $1,600 can join her late this month on a six-day sail around Bimini in the Bahamas for ''healing encounters'' with dolphins.
''This,'' he says on the Web site, ''is why I am working with people who are interested in exploring the potential of being transformed by love and higher intelligence of the dolphins.''

But now that image is being shattered as scientists document the grim slaughters.
They focused on harbor porpoises, marine mammals up to five feet long, that were turning up dead with a strange mix of injuries, including multiple skeletal fractures and damaged internal organs.

Suspects included boats and fishing nets.
''It was, 'Oh my God, the animals I've been studying for the last 10 years are killing these porpoises,' '' Dr. Wilson recalled.
''These findings challenge the benign image of bottlenose dolphins,'' they said.

Again, witnesses and videotape aided the hunt for evidence.
But the scientists speculated that the killers might be male dolphins trying to destroy rival offspring and free up females for mating.
Females, the researchers say, become attractive to males within a few days of losing a calf and apparently, when tending youngsters, stay sexually inactive for years.
Infanticide is common in nature.
Females kill their young when food is scarce and male lions and bears, for example, sometimes kill the young of a female taken as a new mate, giving them a reproductive and evolutionary edge.
The Scottish scientists published these new findings last year in Proceedings of the Royal Society, saying it was ''the first evidence of infanticide in cetaceans,'' the scientific grouping for whales, dolphins and porpoises.
They speculated that the assaults on porpoises might develop ''skills used in infanticidal attacks,'' or alternatively might stem from simple aggression or sexual frustration.
Meanwhile, an American group was independently making similar discoveries as dead porpoises and baby dolphins were washing up along the Virginia coast, many with the telltale internal wounds.
In addition to Ms. Barco, the Virginia group includes Dr. Dunn of the Armed Forces Institute and Dr. Ann Pabst and Dr. William McLellan of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.
Dr. Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert who is aiding the Virginia study, said evolutionary factors seemed a likely explanation for the infanticide.
The two kinds of marine mammals eat different fishes, he said, so food competition is unlikely.
''And there are very few instances when one mammal kills another when there is no risk of predation,'' Dr. Read added.

The emerging consensus is that wild dolphins can be cold-blooded killers.
Federal officials say dolphins pose little threat to people in captive swim programs, where the animals are usually well-trained and closely supervised by experts working in pools and enclosed bays.
During the past five years, the number of such businesses have risen to 18 from 4, said Dr. Barbara A. Kohn, a veterinarian at the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which oversees the field.
And more such tourist attractions are planned.
''That's pretty good,'' she said, adding that no serious injuries had been reported since then.
''So it continues to be fairly safe.''
The danger, experts agree, is when people swim with dolphins in the wild, an increasingly popular, unregulated sport.
For instance, Panama City, Fla., has a half-dozen boats offering such adventures.
''It's a time bomb waiting to go off,'' said Stephanie K. Dorezas, a spokeswomen for the National Marine Fisheries Service, which oversees dolphins in American coastal waters.
Federal officials say the recent scientific findings about wild dolphins and recent mishaps with the big animals are giving the Federal warning campaign a new degree of urgency.
''We're not trying to prevent people from going to the beach or going on dolphin watches,'' said Mr. Spradlin of the fisheries service.
''But they need to do it safely and responsibly.
It's like bird watchers or people on safari.
That same kind of caution and respect needs to be applied to sea life.''
And after five days of strong gains, it was not surprising to see some investors taking profits.
''We have run so far so fast we have to digest'' the gains, said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies & Company.
''But I wouldn't place too much importance in the price moves today because trading is so thin and the breadth is so lousy.''

A few companies, in fact, warned yesterday of lower profits, and their shares plunged.
On the strength of a late comeback, the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 52.24 points, or 0.47 of a percent, to a record 11,187.36, surpassing Friday's peak.
Caterpillar, up 2 13/16, to 62 1/8, and Allied Signal, up 2 1/8, to 63 7/8, placed second and third.
The Nasdaq market, which is dominated by high-technology stocks, gained a modest 0.23 percent in rising 6.26 points, to its new high of 2,743.04.
For example, declines outnumbered advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,691 to 1,307, and the Russell 2000 and the Standard & Poor's 600, which include smaller companies, each fell by nearly 1 percent.

One factor in the industrial commodity rebound, analysts say, is a revival in many of the world's economies from the global financial crisis that began in July 1997.

''Data for world economic growth suggest that rates are going to be higher than thought just a few months ago,'' said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch.
''In the first year of a recovery there is always a rise in demand for copper and other base metals.''
But some other factors have also pushed up commodity prices and will continue to put pressure on the market in the months ahead.
For example, the rally in copper in the last month has been abetted by a series of announcements about production cutbacks.
Asarco is reducing its copper mine output by 7 percent.
The Phelps Dodge Corporation is trimming production by 8 percent, while Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia will shut all its mines in the United States and reduce global production by 1.7 percent.
Some other influences will probably be temporary.
Copper jumped 3 percent on Wednesday because of speculation that Canadian workers would strike at Falconbridge's metallurgical division in Ontario.
For oil, which closed at $19.71 a barrel for August delivery yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the improved outlook can be directly linked to the success of the OPEC countries in maintaining production cutbacks.
(Analysts use different measures, but their compliance estimates were clustered around 90 percent.)
The price had fallen as low as $16.34 a barrel on June 1 after peaking at $18.98 on May 5.

Mr. Rothman predicts oil could end the year as high as $22 a barrel, although he added there could be a selloff between now and $22.
Frederick P. Leuffer, the senior energy analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, is speaking of a ''shockingly high'' $25 a barrel.
He estimates that if OPEC production remains steady at the 26 million barrels a day posted in May, inventories at the end of this year will be lower than at the end of 1996, when oil averaged $24.56 a barrel in the fourth quarter and finished the year just below $26.
The oil outlook has changed so quickly that Mr. Leuffer still has an official forecast of $19.50 a barrel in the second half of the year.
But, he said, ''I see a case developing for $25 oil or higher.''

This jump in oil and other industrial commodities is important for investors, even though it is not expected to produce any big jump in consumer prices or inflation over the longer term.
She now expects it to rise 2.4 percent from December to December, compared with a 1.6 percent increase last year.
That would put inflation back at its pace in 1997.
So it is in no sense an inflationary breakout.
But an outsized jump in just one month could be enough to force the Federal Reserve to raise its target for short-term interest rates another quarter of a percentage point.
Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, estimates that an average oil price of $21 a barrel this month would push gasoline prices to $1.28 a gallon.
And that would be enough to produce a five-tenths of one percentage point jump in the Consumer Price Index.
The consumer price figure for July will be reported Aug. 17, just a week before the next meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.
And Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at American Skandia Life Assurance in Shelton, Conn., said a move of that magnitude would force the Fed's hand.
''If the C.P.I.
jumps up again because of oil or because of other commodity price increases,'' he predicted, ''they will snug up again.''
In a reflection of the recent strong demand for these and other corporate bonds, which offer higher yields than the Treasury market, Government bond prices managed to remain relatively stable ahead of and during the record sale.
For the week, the Dow was up half a percent, hitting two new highs.
The S.& P. 500 rose nine-tenths of one percent, hitting two new highs, while the Nasdaq index was up 1.9 percent, setting three new highs.
The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6 percent from 5.99 percent Thursday.

The yield on the 30-year bond bounced around all day.
Both stock and bond investors will be keeping a close eye on the barometers of economic growth and inflation that the Government will release next week.
Any hint of rising inflation -- which is not expected -- or acceleration in the pace of economic growth could send stocks lower and interest rates higher.

Wednesday will bring the report on producer prices, which could give some signal if the recent rise in industrial commodity prices is affecting prices.
The Government's overall retail sales report for June will also be released Wednesday.
On Thursday, comes the Consumer Price Index for June and industrial production figures follows on Friday.
The University of Michigan survey on consumer sentiment will also be released Friday.
Speaking about the lackluster day in the bond market, Thomas Connor, the head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities, said, ''The bond market wasn't going to get up and go because we want to see the C.P.I.
number next week.''
Equity investors will also begin concentrating on corporate earnings reports as the second-quarter reporting season gears up.
It is the optimism about the outlook for earnings growth the rest of the year that is helping bolster stocks in the face of the quarter-point interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve at the end of last month and the possibility of another later in the year.
The two main compilers of corporate earnings forecasts are predicting a double-digit increase in the profits for the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's stock index.
The First Call Corporation's forecast is an increase of 11.2 percent, compared with the second quarter of 1998.
I.B.E.S.
International's prediction is 10 percent.
Since Fed policy makers raised their short-term interest rate target to 5 percent on June 30, investors have been debating whether another rate increase will be necessary to curb economic growth and keep inflation in check.

It is a world suddenly much larger for the 6-foot-8, 270-pound Brand.
At practice in Orlando, he is banging heads with such all-pro basketball players as Tim Duncan, Allan Houston, Gary Payton and Kevin Garnett.
''I'm trying not to be in awe,'' Brand said shortly before leaving.
''Everything came so fast, but I'm happy with my decision.''
But his admitted touch of awe is part of the realism that has taken the youth from Dunbar Heights this far, the first Westchester basketball player to be drafted No.

There is, however, no lack of confidence, even in the face of some draft experts questioning his No.

Nobody is expecting Brand totally to fill the biggest shoes in basketball history.
''Let's not talk of the next Michael Jordan but of the first Elton Brand.''
Before turning pro, Brand spoke with his good friend from Peekskill, Gov.
George E. Pataki, who told him to ''do what's best for your family.''
In the pros, Brand will change from the center position he manned for Duke to power forward for the Bulls.
He will continually go up against athletes taller than himself.

CHUCK SLATER
Digging in their heels, student protesters have decided once again to continue their strike at Mexico's huge national university, now in its 12th week, even though there are no longer any classes for them to strike against.
Since there is no summer session, no one will even try to give classes on the vast campus until mid-August.
But the strikers voted in a midnight session Saturday to maintain their shutdown even though the university is shutting down on its own.
Figures offered by the administration reveal the dimensions of the political confrontation at the university, the largest and once one of the most prestigious in Latin America.

Brigades of students still occupy the campus and guard barricades blocking the entrances.
Hundreds of strikers have been in residence on the campus, which has no dormitories, since the strike began.
But they immediately argued about procedure, with the administration calling for a closed negotiation and the students demanding to have the talks broadcast live on television.
While the Government has said it does not want to use force to evict the strikers, that option seemed to be an increasingly real possibility.

The strike began as a protest of a plan by the university president, Francisco Barnes de Castro, to charge a modest tuition for those who could afford it.
But he did not approach the strikers ahead of time to see how they would react.
The strike movement has become dominated by unbending leaders, some of whom have made careers of activism at the university and have shown no solid interest in settling with the administration.
While the public seems largely fed up with the strike, the protesters have picked up some outside support.

''I'm an old man and I've seen how this country runs,'' said Salvador Perez Gomez, a 68-year-old merchant who watched the march from the sidelines.
''We have to defend ourselves against this lousy Government and make sure they don't take away our children's right to an education.''
Money flowing out of those markets may well have sought safe haven in the United States Treasury market, they said.
Any improvement in interest rates, however, will be short-lived if reports on producer and consumer prices scheduled for this week are viewed unfavorably.
''The producer price data will be an important determinant in whether bond yields relax further or are pushed back up,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

''The concern is about earnings, and whether or not expectations, which are high, will be exceeded,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
''Many stocks, especially technology shares, have had huge moves in advance of these reports.
Unless a company really blows past the estimates, I expect we might see some profit taking when the numbers are announced.''

Mr. Galvin of Donaldson, Lufkin said that a report expected from Intel after the market closes today would say a great deal about how technology shares might fare in the second half of the year.
In addition to releasing financial data for the second quarter, Intel is expected to provide an outlook on the next six months.
''If Intel says Y2k is not an issue, that will clearly be a positive'' for the market, Mr. Galvin said, referring to concerns about the Year 2000 computer problems.
Profits rose 24 percent, to $268 million, or 50 cents a share in the quarter, surpassing both the 41 cents a share earned a year earlier and Wall Street expectations of 46 cents a share.
''I think Merrill is very well positioned for the global trends driving the industry today -- investment banking trends in Europe, strong trends in the U.S. that continue and Asia's longer-term prospects,'' said Richard Strauss, a securities industry analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company.
''But investors are also going to be keeping a close eye on its Internet strategy, and in the near term I think that expectation is just as important.''

The sharp reversal in Merrill's fortunes in the last year has produced a startling shift in how the once seemingly impregnable firm is perceived by many of its competitors and Wall Street.
The firm's finances were hammered by last year's economic chaos overseas, and it was slower than firms like the Charles Schwab Corporation to embrace the enthusiasm for trading that is sweeping the Internet.
While the stock market seemed to react mildly to Mr. Allison's departure, there is still concern about the lack of a clear successor to Mr. Komansky and how quickly the company will put its house in order.
''There's a sense around the Street that Merrill is adrift,'' said a senior executive at a rival firm.
''I still marvel at where this company was two years ago and where they are today.''
Merrill counters that it is focused on achieving its financial goals and has managers in place who are up to the task of running the firm in an era of brutal competition and rapid change in the financial services industry.
''We're very fortunate to have many talented executives in senior management and great bench strength,'' said Paul W. Critchlow, a Merrill spokesman.

Nonetheless, some analysts yesterday questioned how deep Merrill's managerial bench truly is.
Leading candidates to succeed Mr. Komansky include John L. Steffens, a vice chairman who heads on-line efforts and supervises the firm's army of retail brokers, and Jeffrey M. Peek, who oversees asset management.
Beyond that, some say, the candidates are slim.
Although attention has focused on Mr. Allison's shortcomings since his resignation was announced, Mr. Komansky has presided over a string of high-profile blunders or miscues in recent years.
Those include the aggressive marketing of complex financial products known as derivatives to Orange County, Calif., which helped send the county into bankruptcy; a big expansion into emerging markets, which created financial headaches last year, and an unusually deep involvement in the near collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund.

Merrill's earnings announcement yesterday disclosed smart gains in its overall asset-management business.
In the period, Merrill's net revenue, which includes interest income less interest expense, rose 12 percent, to a record $5.4 billion.
But underwriting fees in most debt categories declined in the second quarter, reflecting concerns about interest rates, the firm said.
But uncertainty about the firm will probably emerge starting in December, when Merrill is scheduled to introduce new Internet-related products and trading accounts.
''People are worried about the fourth quarter, when on-line trading and the retail products that come along with it will be rolled out,'' said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Other analysts shared Ms. Krawcheck's interest in how Merrill's Internet strategy will be deployed.
''There is an inherent conflict with their brokers, which may be compounded by the fact that Launny Steffens will be running both the retail and Internet sides of the business,'' Ms. Solotar said.
''I am hopeful management realizes it needs a cohesive Internet strategy and has a window of five months to put it together.''
There are a number of disturbing economic fundamentals behind the turbulence in the Buenos Aires exchange, which has sent shudders through emerging markets from Brazil to Poland.
They include a growing Government deficit, a failing public pension agency, falling exports and climbing unemployment.
Moreover, President Carlos Saul Menem is looking like an increasingly weak lame duck, especially after capitulating to truck drivers on strike last week demanding an easing of vehicle taxes.

But Mr. Duhalde's comment on debt relief and the Pope was only the latest in a series of campaign statements by Mr. Duhalde and his opponent, the Mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la Rua, that have irked Argentine business executives as well as Government economists.
The winner of the October election is to take power in December.
At a June 25 news conference, Mr. Duhalde said ''debt payments are bleeding us.''
He added, that with ''current levels of debt servicing there will be no possibility of recovery for our country.''
A week later Mr. De la Rua, who has a small lead in the polls, tried to calm investors at a conference for Argentine bankers by pledging that he would not take Argentina off its free-market path or touch the Government policy of pegging the value of the peso to the dollar.

''We're not going to do anything crazy,'' he said, adding that he did not intend to seek a debt pardon nor even a year's grace.
''The power of the state should not be in the hands of investors,'' he said, adding: ''We defend our interests.
The people at the stock exchange defend investors; we defend the debtors.''
But while Wall Street analysts have not liked the increasingly leftist tone of the political campaign, few say they believe that a future Argentine Government will significantly shift economic policy.
Wall Street and Argentine analysts say the current campaign reminds them of President Menem's statements during the 1989 campaign in which he promised to initiate a costly Government employment program and suggested that Argentina should default on its debt.
The moves ended a long period of hyperinflation and led to years of rising Argentine stock prices.
''The candidates' comments are political posturing and should not be taken seriously,'' said Jorge O. Mariscal, Goldman, Sachs & Company's chief investment strategist for Latin America.
''If Argentina were not in the shape it is, they would not matter.
Unfortunately Argentina is not in good shape today.''
Fears of rising interest rates in the United States were also hurting stock prices, according to the report.

Up until now, the campaign has been a lackluster affair with neither candidate offering anything even approaching a coherent economic plan.
But on Tuesday, Mr. De la Rua said he could not promise that he would cut taxes.
In response, Mr. Duhalde said today that he would seek to cut the 21 percent value added tax, though he would not specify by how much.
On the whole, Americans tend to be sympathetic to wildlife.
They have supported the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone National Park, for example, as well as efforts by environmental groups and the Federal Government to protect other endangered species.
But the issue gets more complicated when animals camp on their doorsteps.
Suburban sprawl has created competition for space between humans and wildlife, and while nobody much likes it when deer and waterfowl are edged out of their natural habitat, there are times when the creatures rebound in such numbers that they compromise the quality of community life.
Such is the case with Canada geese in Kent, N.Y., a town that encompasses Lake Carmel in Putnam County.
As described in a recent Times article, Kent has decided that the geese are winning, and has launched a program to round them up and process them as meals for the needy.
Other programs of this kind have failed, most recently in Clarkstown, N.Y., where a similar plan crumbled after protests from animal rights activists.
But with an exploding goose population, Kent officials are standing firm against the rights activists.
Frustrated communities have dubbed Canada geese ''feathered rats.''
They soil parks and raise fears of disease when their waste fouls reservoirs and recreational waters.
The manicured lawns of suburbia provide an Eden for these birds.
Communities like Kent are so appealing that geese often forgo the migratory trip to North Carolina and settle in as year-round squatters, reproducing in great numbers.
Kent's officials have no intention of eradicating all the geese.
Their aim, rather, is to create a smaller, sustainable population on Lake Carmel over several years.
Their program seems a sensible compromise between the needs of nature and, in this case, the rather more urgent needs of the community.
The fact that the doomed geese will be used for food helps soothe the conscience.
The Bears -- in violet shirts, white pants and white and violet caps -- took the field for the first time to the pulsing beat of rock music, ready to face the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds.

In the stands, spectators' expectations varied.
Larry Goldman, the president of the nearby New Jersey Performing Arts Center, whose opening 18 months ago heralded an important beginning to the city's revitalization, said that ''arts and sports, sports and arts would prove to be the leading edge of change in urban areas.''
Isaias Vasquez, 10, attending his first pro baseball game, was in search of memories.
Looking around the stadium and pronouncing it ''beautiful,'' he said, ''I just want to get hit by a ball.''
Two years ago, just two weeks before city and county officials were to break ground on county parkland about a mile away, neighborhood opponents of the plan obtained landmarks designation for the park and blocked construction.

Now we have a waiting list for everything, including promotions for our 36 home games.''
Today, still looking much like a construction site with trailers clogging dusty flats, and some cement walkways cordoned off and still drying, the stadium was pronounced ''fan ready'' by Mr. Levy.
Members of the six-team, independent Atlantic League, the Newark Bears are part of a boom in minor-league baseball that experts say is being fed by the same promise of economic development that comes with having a major league team and stadium.
There are five independent leagues, unaffiliated with major-league teams or their farm systems, with 48 teams.
Alan Simpson, editor of Baseball Today, the trade publication that focuses on minor-league baseball, said the teams of the Atlantic League are an aggressive bunch who are paying more than some other leagues in an effort to get good players and who seem to have a flair for the marketing necessary to build fan interest and profits.

Team manager Tom O'Malley said that ''feeling like nomads'' may have accounted for the dismal record.
But tonight, the Bears gave the fans a thriller, winning 9-8 in 10 innings.
To the Editor:

''Despite the Fears, Inflation Still Refuses to Materialize,'' (Economic View, June 20) skillfully explained the evidence that there are virtually no indications of actual or incipient inflation in our economy today -- and little reason for the Federal Reserve to want to make restrictive moves in monetary policy.
What remains a mystery is the basis for the Fed's compulsion to raise rates last month, even though its chairman, Alan Greenspan, had been acknowledging that we are in the midst of an extraordinary technology boom that is lowering costs and expanding productive capacity at rates never seen before.
The answer, I believe, is that the Fed has no economic model to fit the present environment of technology-driven growth.
The Fed, unable to discard its obsolete thinking about economic expansion, remains dependent on historical economic data that no longer apply to our economy.
The Fed, for example, has dwelled on the fact that labor markets are too tight, while the reality is that scarce labor is a strong incentive for companies to innovate rapidly and invest in new technology.
The inflation fears seem to be unaffected by the tight rein on aggregate demand imposed by a large and growing Federal budget surplus.
The Fed also seems oblivious to the fact that stock market gains tend to be self-limiting and cannot fuel increased consumer spending for very long.
Worst of all, the Fed shows no signs of recognizing that its worries about inflation for several years now have been terribly wrong.
The country is entitled to more accountability than it is now getting from the Fed.

In addition, interest rates in Europe have recently been rising.
While interest rates are still higher in the United States, the narrowing of the gap increases the euro's attractiveness to investors.
And in recent comments, leaders of the European Central Bank have hinted that their next move will be to raise interest rates.
But it will take further confirmation that the economies of Germany and other European nations are turning around before many analysts will be ready to declare that the euro can climb back to its January level of $1.17, and higher.
But he has not changed his long-term outlook.
In fact, BankBoston is still predicting that the euro will drop below $1.00 by the end of the year.

But analysts do not think that the intervention by the Bank of Japan alone can keep the yen from getting stronger.
Yesterday's yen selling was the sixth time that Japan has intervened since June 10, when the yen was 118.96 to the dollar, according to Bloomberg News.
''This slows down the recovery of the yen against the dollar,'' said Karen E. Parker, currency strategist at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
She predicts that the yen will rally to a range of 110 to 115 to the dollar in the next 6 to 12 months.
It is not unusual for one central bank to intervene in the currency markets on behalf of another central bank, and usually such a move does not signal any policy change by the central bank that is asked to intervene.
Then, the Fed joined the Japanese by intervening to support the yen when it was falling sharply, threatening to worsen a global economic crisis.
Nassau's financial predicament -- consisting of the budget deficit and a long-term bond rating just above junk -- has reached the point where the county must borrow $80 million against future sales-tax receipts to meet its expenses for July or it will show a negative fund balance of $34 million, according to the county's underwriters.
Today, Standard & Poor's also reduced a debt rating, moving the county's so-called revenue anticipation notes to SP-2, the next-to-lowest category.
There remains the possibility that the rating could drop even further, to below-investment-grade level, said Richard Marino, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
Nassau now plans to sell $80 million in notes on Thursday or Friday, but it intends to offer investors the added assurance of a bank's letter of credit.
It will come at a cost; one of the county's underwriters estimated that it would add about half a percentage point to the loan's interest rate.
Short-term borrowing, meanwhile, seems to be spreading across Nassau like a virus.
For the first time, a number of charitable agencies that are under contract to the county to provide for its neediest citizens have been forced to seek their own costly loans to pay current salaries and expenses.
They are bracing to lay off workers or shut down programs if they cannot borrow quickly enough.
The agency is owed $465,000 dating back to March.
He lamented having to pay the interest on that money: ''This is where we have to use private dollars?''

In Garden City, the Coalition on Child Abuse and Neglect, another child welfare group, has not been paid since January, said Cynthia Cavallo, its executive director.
The group is owed $154,000 out of an annual budget of $800,000.
''To get through the next four to six weeks, we need $70,000.''
Jack O'Connell, executive director of the Health and Welfare Council of Long Island, said dozens of the 300 organizations he represents had reported being increasingly squeezed by delays in payments from Nassau.
''We have 14 agencies coming here to my office tomorrow to talk about the county contracting problem,'' he said.
''And it isn't all necessarily attributed to the same problem.''
One reason, Mr. O'Connell said, is that county departments are taking much longer to negotiate annual renewal contracts, meaning that charitable groups have to work for months into the year until they can submit vouchers for reimbursement.

But Mr. Parola, who called the delays ''an ongoing disgrace,'' said his office routinely processes payments in fewer than 30 days.
''The delay is in the departments,'' he said, shifting blame back to Mr. Gulotta.
All of which is no consolation to such groups as the Long Island Council of Churches, which is owed $150,000 dating back to December.
Thomas W. Goodhue, executive director of the council.
''One person says they changed their computer system.
Then there are new voucher numbers.
Then someone hasn't signed off on the vouchers.
Then it's, 'We haven't got the vouchers yet.'
Then they'll say they need to recompute some numbers.''
''We're borrowing $25,000 at 11 percent,'' he said -- more than twice the county's short-term borrowing rate -- ''and we're trying to borrow another $50,000 at 9 percent.
Because who knows when we'll be paid the rest of what the county owes us.''
Even with those loans, Mr. Goodhue said, he may have to furlough chaplains at the county hospital and nursing home.
''That $14,000 will be just enough for us to make payroll this time,'' he said.
The apparent reason for the change is that counting tax cuts, gross Government debt can be expected to rise slightly over the next 10 years because of transfers between Government accounts.
That would mean tax cuts could not go into effect.
But total interest payments are projected to fall because the Congressional Budget Office is forecasting lower interest rates.
Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now an economist at the Brookings Institution and who opposes tax cuts, said, ''It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.''
But the experts can take solace in one point: Hardly anyone in Congress thinks the contrivance will become law.
A top staff member on the Senate Finance Committee said there was no chance this would become part of a companion bill that will go before the Senate as early as next week.

''I didn't want to be part of killing a significant tax bill,'' said Representative Marge Roukema of New Jersey, adding that she could not have voted for the bill without the trigger mechanism.

What if the bill comes back from the conference with the Senate without the mechanism?
''We'll have to face that when we come to it,'' Ms. Roukema replied.
Another moderate, Representative Nick Smith of Michigan, who was one of the main authors of the compromise, said, ''If this doesn't come back from conference, 40 Republicans will have to be convinced that our conferees really tried and couldn't do it.
And even then some of us will be quite wary.''
Here is how the mechanism would work: Each July, the budget office would determine whether total Government interest payments, to the public and to Government trust funds, were lower in the previous 12 months than they had been in the 12-month period before that.
Otherwise, the tax cut would be postponed for a year.
Then it would be subject to the same test of lower interest payments.
Under the bill, tax rates would fall by one percentage point in 2003 and continue to fall in annual increments until the reduction reached 10 percentage points in 2009.
The other tax cuts in the bill, like the reduction in capital gains rates and the abolition of inheritance taxes, would not be affected.
The worst problem cited by the policy experts is that interest payments, which depend not only on the size of the debt but also the level of interest rates, are not always a good measure of debt reduction.
Another problem is that if interest payments rise sharply from one year to the next and then fall slightly in the following year, a tax reduction would be allowed even though more interest was paid in the third year than in the first.
The S.& P. 500 fell 4.4 percent for the week, its worst performance since the week ended Sept. 4, on concern that interest rates are headed higher.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said Thursday that the central bank might raise borrowing costs to head off inflation.
The concern over interest rates overshadowed corporate profits that are growing at the fastest rate since the third quarter of 1997.

But Thomas M. McManus, equity portfolio strategist at Banc of America Securities, thinks this earnings run could last a long, long time, and he took some time last week to explain why.
Here are some excerpts:

Q.
You are of the view that this period of strong earnings growth can continue for the indefinite future.
Why?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A. I sense a significant underlying shift in the ability of American companies to grow earnings.
For many, the roots are in consolidation, which has been important in terms of combining two attractive businesses, maintaining the same amount of revenues but with a much smaller cost base.
That doesn't happen instantly, but over a couple of years.
Even without consolidation, companies have continued to restructure, coming up with a different mix of businesses that are growing faster, are less cyclical and in areas that are attractively positioned.
The best example here is General Electric, which has been restructuring its businesses for 20 years.
Q.
So what does this lead you to conclude?
A.
That there is a higher secular growth rate for S.& P. earnings than most are willing to concede.
And the cyclical rebound off of the decline in earnings last year has occurred sooner and been more robust than anyone had forecast.
Q.
What is your current earnings forecast?
A.
And I think we are going to raise estimates for this year and 2000 again.

Q.
What do you say to those who say the S.& P. is overvalued at these levels?
A. I think anyone who is saying the market is overvalued this year, be it the Fed or stock market strategists, is not taking into account that the underlying business mix has improved at least as much as General Electric has improved because of a very rapid turnover of components in the index.
It now has less cyclicality and greater sustainability than it did in the past and deserves to trade at a higher P/E multiple relative to any interest rate you might choose or any competing market benchmark around the world.
Also, people should be focusing on free cash flows, not earnings.
Net income is only the first approximation of profitability.
The real value to investors is the amount of cash a company can take out and still be left with a business that is just as good as it was before.
Companies like Microsoft and Intel are like that, and that is one reason they trade at such high multiples to net income.
Q.
There are plenty of folks who are worried about the effect that Year 2000 computer problems will have on the economy and earnings.
Do you share those concerns?
A.
It is my view that profits are actually being negatively impacted right now.
It is my hunch that is their Y2K compliance system.
Q.
Which companies or groups of companies are likely to enjoy the most rapid earnings growth over the next year or so?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A.
We could see continued improvement in a whole host of companies.
Right now, the market is looking for trends of earnings repair, or a bounce off the dip we saw last year.
Individual companies we like include Ethan Allen, the furniture manufacturer and retailer, which experienced a significant hit last year.
We also like W. W. Granger, which is investing heavily in its Internet presence.
We are also very attracted to the semiconductor capital equipment sector, and really like Novellus in that area.
And we like technology generally.
The passage should have read: ''We are also very attracted to the semiconductor capital equipment sector, and really like Novellus in that area.
And we like technology generally.''
Despite the extended decline, the Nasdaq composite is still up more than 19 percent this year.
''The Nasdaq is correcting for the excesses it recorded over the past month,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
''All in all, the market is in pretty good shape, but it needs to take a pause.''
Peter J. Canelo, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, suggested that technology stocks might fall out of favor for a while.
''It has been my thesis that good second-quarter earnings would help technology stocks, but that after those numbers were reported worries about Y2K and the like would cause the market to rotate back to areas like energy, cyclical and financial services stocks,'' he said.

He added, ''The market needs a shift in leadership to keep advancing, and I think that will happen.''

''We are going to see this sort of trading pattern,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
''I think a lot of portfolio managers are taking profits and putting on longer-term hedges, particularly in technology stocks, which despite their terrific long-term prospects are very pricey right now.''
''The risk-reward status of the S.& P. 500 at levels above 1,300 will remain poor for most of the second half,'' Ms. Callies wrote.
''Investors should not chase rallies but should use trading bounces to rebalance portfolios and raise modest amounts of cash.''
High valuations and worries that the Federal Reserve Board might raise interest rates again took a toll on technology stocks.

Re ''Seeking Common Ground on Federal Tax Cut'' (news article, July 25):

Now is not the time for a tax cut.
A tax cut will stimulate the economy further, prompting the Federal Reserve to compensate with a larger interest-rate increase.
At some future point when the economy needs a boost a tax cut would be a useful tool.
Why squander it now?
In the meantime, there's a little matter of the national debt.
When do Republicans figure the debt should be paid off?
When we're in a recession?

Douglas, Alaska, July 25, 1999
''The stock market is waiting for some heavy-duty data,'' said Christine A. Callies, chief investment strategist at CS First Boston, mainly to examine them for any signs of inflation that might persuade Fed policy makers to raise short-term interest rates again.
Consequently, market operators are now awaiting today's Labor Department survey of employment costs and the Commerce Department's first estimate of gross domestic product, both covering the quarter ended June 30.
''The market is sort of slip-sliding around here'' except for a ''relief'' rally in high technology, said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers.

Senate Votes to Cut Taxes By $792 Billion in 10 Years

The Senate voted to cut taxes by $792 billion over the next 10 years, moving the Republican-controlled Congress toward a showdown with President Clinton over how the nation can best use trillions of dollars in projected Federal budget surpluses.
The bill would cut personal income taxes by reducing the lowest tax rate starting in 2001.
It would give a tax break to many married couples, expand the Individual Retirement Account program, create a deduction for some health insurance costs and reduce the inheritance tax on large estates.

But, as Fenby points out in his first chapter, ''Something Special,'' the French have become obsessed with l'exception francaise.
''France occupies an exclusive place in the world, and could accept nothing less,'' he writes.
''It is, its President declares, a beacon for the human race.
The nation and its people may be loved or hated, but they can never be ignored.''
Among a veritable potpourri of facts, anecdotes and eccentricities that prove the point, Fenby offers one delightful illustration of French scorn for Anglo-Saxon pragmatism.
''It will work in practice, yes,'' a French diplomat is said to have remarked.
''But will it work

in theory?''
This is a chapter that any newcomer to France is well advised to memorize: it is food for many a lively dinner table conversation.
Indeed, the entire book serves as a valuable introduction to contemporary France.
Fenby stops and looks at every corner of French society, contrasting how it was with what it has become; with an occasional glance back, he also tracks the swings of French politics since Charles de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic in 1959.
One theme runs through his story: ''The conservative strain in French life has always been far stronger than the revolutionary images suggest.''
Change has come, but it has rarely been welcomed.
In a chapter called ''Vanishing Madeleines,'' Fenby notes that the classic images of France -- beret, baguette, dark cigarettes, corner cafe, the accordion, garlic and the like -- have all lost ground in daily life: only three beret factories survive, most baguettes are made with frozen preconstituted dough, foreign cigarette brands account for almost half of total sales, cafes are closing at an alarming rate, only Romanian Gypsies now seem to play accordions and even garlic consumption is falling.

Fast food is by now well entrenched and, worse, embraced by many French as a useful short cut in rushed urban schedules.
Business lunches and summer vacations are shrinking.
French men may still have wandering eyes, but they have less time for mistresses.
The convenience -- and lower prices -- of supermarkets have put many shopkeepers out of business in cities and, even more alarmingly, in villages, which are dying across France (albeit occasionally revived in a different form as summer havens for Parisians and northern Europeans).
The countryside, after all, is the repository of French nostalgia.
Thus, rare is the city dweller who does not have a parent or grandparent born in some distant pays.
Even now, Fenby notes, ''French townspeople have more country homes than any other Europeans.''
And it is the countryside that provides the food and wines that remain so central to France's image of itself.
''Rural France,'' Fenby says, ''is a state of mind.''
Yet the reality is painful.
As agriculture has modernized, small farms have closed and villages have been abandoned.
Returning one August to a village that had known better times, Fenby recalls: ''That used to be the busiest time of the year.
The pace quickens, though, when the author turns to the grim suburbs, or banlieues, of major cities, suburbs that have been transformed over the past 25 years by Arab and African immigration.
The first generation of immigrants consisted in the main of solitary men with jobs.
And now their children are rapidly forming an underclass living in project housing, unemployed, surrounded by drugs and violence.
Fenby recounts familiar stories of gang warfare, race riots and ritual car burnings, but he also visits several banlieues and is left alarmed by the anger and despair he encounters.
And, he notes, ''Each banlieue riot involving young immigrants sends more votes to the far right.''
When it comes to pointing fingers, however, Fenby does not hesitate.
Whether it is France's failure to integrate immigrants and the commensurate rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right National Front, whether it is the growth of unemployment to a constant 11 percent of the work force, whether it is the spate of corruption scandals in public life, he sees the country's political elite as ultimately responsible.
Today a few thousand politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, many of them graduates of the exclusive ecole Nationale d'Administration, run France and, in Fenby's view, all too often they run it for themselves.
And the French are beginning to notice.
NARROWING his target, Fenby then looks at how three men exercised the monarchical powers of the French presidency over the past 25 years.
He is not impressed.
But if he portrays Valery Giscard d'Estaing (1974-81) as a vainglorious snob and Jacques Chirac (1995 to the present) as something of a buffoon, he believes Fran-->ois Mitterrand (1981-95) was positively dangerous -- devious and unprincipled.
''In opposition, his amorality could be excused as necessary in the pursuit of power,'' Fenby writes.
Given what the future keeps bringing them, the French are understandably fearful of still more future.
However, given their continued expectation that the state solve their problems, Fenby sees no alternative to looking again to the elite to find answers.
He points the way: it must lead a nonviolent revolution, ''which embraces the modern world while preserving the best of the past.''
He even harbors some hope that the current ''cohabitation'' between the conservative Chirac and his Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, will produce ''a different kind of politics, which would be much less ideological, less a prisoner of the state, more open-minded -- and, dare one hope, less personalized.''
Yet he does not sound too sure.
He demonstrates that he cares passionately for France, but he ends his book with France still ''on the brink.''
Ever since last fall, when Danka's board changed the company's management, plucking Mr. Switzer from Fruit of the Loom and selecting Brian L. Merriman from Toshiba as president, the two men have been cutting, chopping, negotiating and otherwise wrenching Danka back from the brink of bankruptcy.

They talked the company's banks, which were poised to call in loans, into extending more credit.
They got the Xerox Corporation to buy back a lackluster business for servicing older, scattered Xerox machines.
Danka used to have 48 warehouses; it now has 3.
It eliminated 1,400 jobs, reducing the work force to 17,000, and integrated data systems.
Now, they are phasing out products from all but three vendors: Canon, Toshiba and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen A.G.
The German company bought Kodak's copier business in March, giving it ownership of the Digisource 9110, the only copier fast enough to rival Xerox's Docutech line.
Danka's operating expenses are still high, as are the double-digit interest rates it is paying on its $1.1 billion debt.
A deal to sell its international operations to Schroder Ventures, a British holding company, fell through in June, depriving Danka of cash it needs to service debt.
Its sales remain sluggish.
And competition keeps getting fiercer as more companies introduce digital copiers.
''We may see more pricing pressures on everyone in the next 12 to 18 months,'' warned Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
Still, Danka no longer seems headed for extinction.
''We've seen the last really horrendous quarter,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Securities Research.
Investors are coming around.
''I bought this stock at $4, and I expect to make a lot of money on it,'' said Frank G. Cannata, who edits a copier-industry newsletter and who said he expects Danka A.D.R.
's to top $15 in a year.
''They've made progress in every critical area.''
To fully understand the magnitude of Danka's turnaround, one has to first understand the depths to which the company had sunk.

Danka, which was formed in 1977, immediately began gobbling up other dealers.
It, in turn, was purchased by a British holding company in 1986, and Danka's shares began trading in London that year.
The A.D.R.
's began trading on Nasdaq in 1992.
By last year Danka was an international giant, handling more than 40 copiers from six manufacturers, each with hefty costs for training and spare-parts inventories.
If a large customer wanted to install one type of equipment in all its branches, Danka could not guarantee service at every location.
''Frustrations were surfacing even as Xerox was introducing its first digital products in 1997.''

In desperation, Mr. Switzer and Mr. Merriman reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that Danka might file for bankruptcy.
Danka has since been helped by fortuitous timing.
Both Canon and Toshiba came out with full lines of digital copiers, helping Danka flesh out its scrawny digital product line.
And Danka negotiated a deal with Heidelberger for distributing the Digisource that does not involve high fixed prices or promises to take Heidelberger's entire output.
While the distribution contract is not exclusive, Danka's participation in Digisource's development -- and its relationships with Kodak's customers -- gives it a head start in selling and servicing the machine.

Still, Danka's path to growth remains obstacle-strewn.
Since it has stopped servicing Xerox's older machines, it has lost an invaluable foot in the door to some clients of Xerox, which uses neither Danka nor the country's largest distributor, Ikon Office Solutions.
Meanwhile, I.B.M.
has announced its own high-speed copier.
And many of the Kodak salespeople who left Danka have customer relationships they can build on for rival distributors.
Mr. Merriman has been reorganizing Danka's sales force, putting former Kodak people in charge of many major accounts and leaving most of the aggressive selling to the Danka sales force.
Still, several analysts say that sales is Danka's weak link.
''I'm not sure that Danka has the experienced personnel to sell high-speed digital devices,'' said Edward Lee, a senior analyst at Lyra Research.
Indeed, Danka's revival has not prompted its competitors or suppliers to shift strategies.
''We're targeting more than 200 resellers for our products, and no change in Danka's prospects will have an impact on our marketing plans,'' said a spokesman for the Hewlett-Packard Company, which is pushing a line of hybrid printer-copiers called mopiers, that it had once planned to distribute through Danka.
And Canon is trying to bring its direct sales up to 45 percent of total revenue from 35 percent now.
The company also stopped granting any independent distributors exclusive territories.
That can help Danka sell equipment and service packages to large customers -- but it can help Ikon do so as well.
''Danka has a lot of potential to grow with us, but Ikon is still a bigger channel for us,'' said Tod D. Pike, senior vice president for Canon USA's imaging systems group.
Ikon also spent much of this year paring vendors and shoring up a sagging bottom line, and it has said it will concentrate on pumping up sales of a few big vendors -- including Canon -- when its 2000 fiscal year starts in October.
''Narrowing down vendors is a smart move for anyone,'' said Dennis Le Strange, senior vice president for Ikon North America, ''but we remain focused on our own plans.''
Indeed, many of Danka's competitors hope the company makes it.
They see a revived Danka as an ally in the battle to prevent Xerox, which declined to comment for this article, from getting the same hammerlock on the digital copier market that it has enjoyed in analog copiers.

''I'll root for any company that can persuade customers to buy from someone other than the big X,'' said Jim Ivy, chief executive of the Savin Corporation, a copier manufacturer owned by Ricoh.
''If Danka grows, it'll be more effective in competing with Xerox, and anyone who hurts Xerox is good in my books.''
The index is generally considered to be the best measure of what's happening to overall compensation, which encompasses both wages and health benefits and pensions.

So the markets' anxiety may have been understandable.
First, as anyone who works with economic statistics knows, a single quarter's estimate does not a trend make.
Third and most important, so long as worker productivity continues to rise at about 2 percent a year, American companies can afford to pay their workers 3.5 to 4 percent more per year without increasing their prices faster than the current inflation rate of about 2 percent.

Why, then, are financial markets so skittish?
There are several factors at work that have nothing to do with American workers' pay.
The global economy is heating up as Europe, Japan and several emerging markets recover from recessions.
This is causing commodity prices to rebound, increasing the prices of things like energy, which are also important ingredients of production costs.
In addition, greater competition for capital in the rest of the world is curbing foreign appetite for American financial assets, driving the dollar's value down in recent weeks.
This is a source of anxiety because the dollar's appreciation has shaved at least half a percent off our annual inflation rate during the last few years.
In short, there is little evidence that labor costs are rising, despite tight labor markets, but there is mounting evidence that other factors have again shifted the balance of risks facing the American economy toward inflation.
Moreover, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has signaled that the Fed is poised to raise short-term interest rates again this year if necessary to pre-empt an increase in inflationary pressure.
This is hardly a soothing message for equity markets, which according to standard models are somewhat overvalued and therefore vulnerable to correction.
Still, all this skittishness should not obscure the fact that tight labor markets have been a real boon for the American economy.
After years of stagnation, wages and family incomes for the majority of Americans are finally growing; after decades of widening, income inequality is finally narrowing, and unemployment rates for members of racial minorities and high-school dropouts have hit record lows.
The challenge for Washington in the coming months will be how to navigate this expansion along a road marred by potholes of inflationary risk.
The good news is that with inflation and interest rates still low, productivity growth strong and technological change fueling investment in new production capacity, there is no need for the Fed to slam on the brakes.
A little judicious slowing at the right time -- that is, a small adjustment or two in rates if conditions warrant -- should do the trick, so long as those nervous financial markets do not cause us to lose sight of the road.
''This is not just an isolated day,'' said Bob Gasser, head of United States equity trading at J. P. Morgan Securities.
''It is a lot tougher for the market to deal with rising interest rates than with good corporate earnings.''

Mr. Gasser and other analysts said the market was likely to remain in a highly unsettled state until at least Friday, when July employment data are scheduled to be released.
The Federal Reserve Board, which meets Aug. 24 to debate whether it should raise short-term interest rates, is likely to pay close attention to that report.
The stock has lost nearly half its market value since early April.

Stocks of Internet brokerage firms, which have also been beaten up recently, were battered again after Bill Burnham, an Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, issued a report saying the companies might see their first-ever decline in trading volume, in the third quarter, because of weakness in the Internet stocks their companies favor.
''To see growth in negative territory is significant, but not earth shattering,'' Mr. Burnham said.

America Online, the world's largest Internet service, continued its slump, with the stock falling for the fourth session, shedding 4 1/16, to 88 13/16.
Since April 6, when it peaked at 175 1/2, the stock has fallen nearly 50 percent.
''The good news from this summer's selling of Internet shares is that the bears will be hard pressed to still call this a bubble market,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
''At this point, the easy money appears to have been made in Internet stocks.''
Qualcomm was the biggest loser on the Nasdaq, falling 12 1/2, to 140.
The Nasdaq index fell 47.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 2,540.00, and is now down 11.3 percent from its high of 2,864.48 on July 16.
This means the market is experiencing a correction, which Wall Street defines as any decline of more than 10 percent; a drop of 20 percent is considered a bear market.
''People seem to have gotten scared and tired'' in recent weeks, said George Cohen, a portfolio manager at Cohen, Klingenstein & Marks.

''People have lost huge sums.''
Bucking the trend were some companies whose products are considered to be tied closely to the economy.
Despite the widespread distress elsewhere in the sector, an initial public offering by Internet Initiative Japan, which connects Japanese companies and consumers to the Internet, met an enthusiastic reception.
But at least two more initial public offerings were withdrawn, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data: Reynard Motorsport and Country Maid Financial.
No African nation is as sadly recidivist as Angola.
Agreements to end the power struggle between the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi and the Government have been within reach in 1975, 1991 and 1994, but never successfully grasped.
What's the problem?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Most African and Western governments blame Mr. Savimbi, whose ambition is said to impede any deal that does not give him the presidency.
His refusal to accept the outcome of the 1992 election and his return to armed struggle is a case in point.
The rebels only went through the motions of carrying out a 1994 power-sharing arrangement in which they would join the government as a junior partner.
Today, Mr. Savimbi's forces have the military initiative in much of the country and are pushing civilians they cannot feed into the Government-controlled cities, deliberately creating conditions for a popular explosion.
Using guerrilla logic mastered during 35 years in the bush, Mr. Savimbi aims to isolate the regime in the cities, cut power and water supplies and sow panic.
The United States and other countries are now trying to isolate, punish and coerce the rebels while stepping up support for the Government in Luanda.
The Security Council is trying to cut off Mr. Savimbi's access to the billions in diamond revenue that has helped him to sustain a war against an oil-rich Government.

But this approach is no more likely to bring peace to Angola than previous attempts.
Despite massive military spending and imports of new artillery and aircraft, Angola's top soldiers have few illusions about winning: Angola is too big, the Unita guerrillas have too many advantages and are too skillful for that.
The military's game is a long one, involving defense, containment and attrition.
Over time, it hopes to wear the rebels down, raise their costs and bleed their forces, while squeezing their ability to sustain arms imports.
It is the strategy of comfortable incumbents who know their limits and believe they can deny Mr. Savimbi victory.
On Unita's side, meanwhile, the war itself represents a tolerable definition of survival, and survival is a form of victory.
The rebel group obtains external supplies through various networks and channels that flourish in a world of weak, destabilized states and porous borders.
Ukrainians, South Africans, Ugandans and Zambians among many others are mentioned as tacit or active partners.
African airspace and ports are not difficult to move through.
Moreover, Unita has always captured a big portion of its supplies from the Government itself.
Opportunists with a Leninist sense of power are in charge on both sides in Angola.
Neither places a high priority on peace or people.
Barring victory, both prefer war over peace.
But for the people of Angola the permanent war is intolerable.
In some war zones, land mines are being planted faster than crops.
The World Food Program regularly revises upward its estimates of emergency food requirements but has received less than 40 percent of what it needs.
Once-eradicated diseases like polio are thriving once again in Angola's inaccessible areas.
Infant and child mortality rates are rising to appalling levels.
Perhaps, instead of debating which political bed to jump into tomorrow, the United States would be better advised to engage not only with the Government but also with Angola's fragile civil society institutions, the churches, the humanitarian agencies and those ''autonomous'' leaders who are now speaking out against the unconscionable behavior of incumbent elites.
Kofi Annan is right to call for the real friends of Angola to engage in the search for peace, as he did last week.
But one wonders if this is best done by having American military and diplomatic resources placed at the disposal of the recognized but unaccountable Government of Angola.
We need a broader regional effort: the conflicts in Congo and Angola have fed off each other and continue to do so.
The drama in Central Africa requires more than picking a favored side.
It demands a coherent strategy building on the recent Congo pact to create a fresh momentum for peace.

Millions of people, of course, have refinanced homes as interest rates plunged from high double digits in the early 1980's to less than 7 percent as recently as last April.
Some have benefited from automatic, cost-free reductions provided by adjustable-rate mortgages.
But many people with adjustable mortgages are now finding their rates going up.
For City Line's borrowers, when rates fall by as little as half a percentage point, Mr. Riley will send E-mail or otherwise notify them that a lower rate can be theirs, so long as the mortgage payments have been on time for a year and the borrower remains employed.
City Line, a smallish, eight-year old family-owned mortgage banker in San Diego, is not being charitable.
About a year ago, Mr. Riley decided that there was a better living to be made by servicing mortgages over many years than by pocketing a quick few hundred dollars for originating loans and then watching customers refinance them elsewhere.
''We service our own loans.
If rates drop, why would I want you to go to Countrywide'' for refinancing, Mr. Riley asked, referring to one of the nation's biggest mortgage operations.
''Why wouldn't I want to keep you myself?''
Like most lenders, City Line sells its loans to large institutions.
But it continues to service the loans, generating $25 to $40 a month for collecting each payment, writing checks from the escrow account for taxes and insurance and keeping related records.
But its spread has been relatively slow.

One reason is that rates have been mostly on the rise this year, withering refinancing incentives for all but the most dilatory high-rate borrowers.
Many of those obtaining the loans now, therefore, are home buyers rather than refinancers.
Close ties to customers could prove crucial in assuring them of City Line's commitment to automatic downward adjustments, which is included in both a brochure and loan documents but whose enforceability appears to be legally untested.
Service Savers in Fairfax, Va., a division of National City Mortgage, has quietly given these loans to a few thousand customers since 1993.
The company is now promoting the mortgages, while saying that its commitment to cut rates cannot be legally binding because the loans would then be harder to resell.
Although Service Savers' rates tend to be a bit higher than those of other lenders, the company says that its lower closing costs and the prospect of rate cuts more than compensate.
''Why pay $4,000 to get a lower rate when you can wait and get that rate for free'' when the market improves, asked Joe Kelly, the Service Savers division manager.

In Arizona, Ahwatukee Mortgage and Investments Inc., a mortgage broker in the booming Phoenix area, has fastened onto Mr. Riley's program and steers customers to City Line.
''There's no safer investment than people's homes,'' said Michael Thomas, Ahwatukee's president.
But it will take time for automatically reducing loans to be embraced by the industry's giants, Mr. Thomas predicted, saying that they are less intent on keeping their customers and the servicing income for the long run.

It was 25 years ago this Monday when the 37th President told his staff ''never be petty, always remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them and then you destroy yourself.''
But almost everyone still has an opinion about the most controversial President of the 20th century -- a man generations grew up admiring for his anti-Communism, his doggedness and his humble, nonestablishment background, or opposing for his rough campaign style, his falsehoods and the four years he took to end the Vietnam War.
Agreeing with Mr. Naughton, Mr. Hart said the media had dulled Watergate's prominence by ''attaching the word '-gate' to each and every scandal, making them equivalent to Watergate.''

Americans are now most likely to learn about Watergate in high school, where it is often an object lesson on the separation of powers among the legislative, executive and judicial branches of Government.
The amount of detail varies greatly from one textbook to another.
But there are other sources of information, too.
No similar debate goes on in popular culture, however.
The Fox television cartoon show ''The Simpsons'' regularly tells Nixon jokes and imitates his voice and face.
Another Fox cartoon drama, ''Futurama,'' shows Nixon's head in a jar, occasionally fed fish food to keep it alive.
David Cohen, the executive producer of the program about the 31st century, said an episode this fall would have Nixon's head running for President of Earth in the year 3000.
Mr. Cohen would not say if he will win.
And just last week, ''Dick,'' a comedy movie, opened with a portrayal of Nixon as a dimwitted, foul-mouthed heavy drinker, surrounded by clueless aides, whose Watergate crimes are discovered through unlucky accidents.
The accomplishments of his Presidency are portrayed to the public most clearly at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Birthplace at Yorba Linda, Calif., where he was buried.
Exhibits allow visitors to ask the late President questions he answers through recordings, and show statues of foreign leaders he dealt with.
Last week the steady pace of tourists kept coming to Yorba Linda, saying they had grown more appreciative of his foreign policy achievements.

John Taylor, director of the library and museum, said its approximately 150,000 visitors a year, even including the occasional Nixon hater, generally seemed well informed.
In Washington, which has finally come to share the nation's fatigue with scandal, none are planned either.
But in Grand Rapids, Mich., Mr. Smith's institution will celebrate a different sort of Aug. 9, the 25th anniversary of the first day of the Ford Presidency.

The five-year notes mature Aug. 15, 2004.
To compose and edit music on a PC, a musician purchases a low-cost MIDI interface box for less than $100, which connects to a computer via the serial port, or installs a MIDI card.
Music sequencing software like Cakewalk Pro, Steinberg Cubase or Mark of the Unicorn Digital Performer is used to record the notes, as well as the composition's instrumentation, key and length.

To play music in real time, a controller, which can be a MIDI-compatible keyboard or wind or string instrument, is added.
The setup will also include at least one synthesizer, which actually creates the sounds.
Some synthesizers manipulate samples of different instruments that have been stored in its memory.
Those sounds are then fed to an amplifier and speakers to become audible.
With this MIDI-compliant package, a composer today can create compositions that to most listeners sound as if they are actually being played by scores of musicians seated in a concert hall.
''MIDI gives composers the musical equivalent of a word processor,'' said Thomas Dolby Robertson, founder of Beatnik, which produces technology to deliver high-quality music and sound over the Internet.
A MIDI-compatible computer can control up to 16 different channels on each of an infinite number of synthesizers that can be chained together, giving composers the ability to create music with innumerable layers of sounds.
Unlike MP3 or the other musical compression formats, MIDI files are not composed of musical sounds; rather, they are digital instructions telling the synthesizers what notes to create, how long to play them and with what intensity.

MIDI's small file size makes it ideal for CD-ROM games, in which space is at a premium.
A game player hears music because the disk's embedded MIDI data instructs the PC's sound card to create certain notes.
But those notes are not embedded in the game itself.
Composers, equipped with very expensive synthesizers, use MIDI to create compositions that would be impossible or extraordinarily expensive to perform with live musicians.
Jeff Rona, who has composed musical scores for the movie ''White Squall'' and the television shows ''Chicago Hope'' and ''Profiler,'' uses MIDI and computer sequencing software to create compositions performed by virtual orchestras.
Changing the sound from a violin to a cello or tuba is a simple matter of the PC instructing the synthesizer to use a different instrument.
Mr. Robertson samples unusual sounds, like crickets and trees falling in the forest, and then using MIDI commands instructs the synthesizer to substitute those for cymbals and bass drums.

Because of the complications of human speech, the MIDI standard will remain confined to controlling tones, like instrument sounds and sound effects, that can be accurately sampled and then reproduced electronically by synthesizers.
''Voice sampling is rarely done,'' said Tom White, president of the MIDI Manufacturers' Association.
''Speech is extremely complicated.
There are so many nuances, mouth shapes and tones that it's very difficult to create virtual speech from a recorded sample.''
Some MIDI software has a ''humanizer'' element that subtly alters tempo and dynamics so that the music does not sound machine perfect.
But can music created using synthesizers and sampled tones, and controlled by MIDI devices, ever sound exactly like the real thing?
''MIDI-created music can't, because physical sounds are intrinsically linked to underlying physical gestures,'' said David Mash, vice president of information technology at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.
''If you play a violin sound on a keyboard, you can't play the keyboard as if it's a violin.
When you're one person, trying to perform 15 different parts of a composition by yourself, you've got to try and inject those missing personalities that would be there in a live performance.
It's very difficult to do so.
Still, it's a lot cheaper than hiring a whole symphony orchestra.''

Correction Appended

J. P. Morgan & Company, one of the most prestigious banks in the nation, has been sued by the Sumitomo Corporation, one of Japan's largest banks, over loans to a copper trader whose trading binge ended in heavy losses in the mid-1990's.
The Chase Manhattan Corporation and UBS A.G. of Switzerland have also been sued recently by Sumitomo in connection with the scandal.
Chase lent the trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, about $500 million, according to that suit, which Chase has contested.
Morgan, which prides itself on being one of the country's most cautious lenders, is the only bank to have been singled out by United States regulators for its role in the scandal.
Morgan is a leading provider of the complex financial instruments known as derivatives and has been an aggressive advocate of looser regulatory controls over the lucrative products.

Sumitomo has received heavy fines from United States and British regulators because of the scandal.
''J.
''J.
According to the lawsuit, Morgan executives, including Keith Murphy, a managing director, courted Mr. Hamanaka enthusiastically in the early 1990's as the bank tried to expand its metals business.
The executives, according to the suit, portrayed Morgan as a worthy partner because ''the credit risks involved in the kinds of very large transactions for which Hamanaka was known could be significant.''

Mr. Murphy, who is also named as a defendant in the suit, resigned from Morgan in the wake of the scandal.
His current whereabouts could not be determined.
The suit contends that Morgan took this promise to a ''ridiculous and unlawful extreme by actively assisting Hamanaka in his efforts to keep his transactions with J. P. Morgan hidden not only from the outside world, but from Hamanaka's own superiors within Sumitomo.''
It is one of the biggest traders in metals, machinery and other goods; it is not a bank.
(It is an affiliate of the Sumitomo Group of companies, which also includes Sumitomo Bank Ltd., one of Japan's largest banks.)

The event, at Iowa State University, was devised as a money-making operation by Iowa Republicans -- and in its two-decade history, the Republican straw poll victor has never made it to the White House.
''Well thanks to you, we gain a lot.
We have more than accomplished what we set out to do.''
But the results underscored that his operation is deft at turning its deep resources into organizational prowess.
I am grateful to the grass-roots citizens of Iowa who came out in large numbers to support our principled conservative message.''
That is about a quarter of the roughly 100,000 Iowans who took part in this state's pivotal caucuses in 1996.

The Hilton Coliseum here was so jammed with eager participants that the fire marshal locked the doors for more than an hour, leaving frantic campaign workers struggling to guide supporters to voting stations outside the arena.
Because the Presidential campaign has been so fast-paced, with many states moving up the dates of their primaries, the results tonight could winnow the field.
Politics can be a circus, and there was no better display of that than the scene here today.
Candidates competed not over tax or education policy, but over who could erect the biggest tent, serve the tastiest barbecue and offer the finest country-and-western music.
''Is this the way to pick a President?''
asked former Representative Bill Zeliff of New Hampshire as he stood between a clown on stilts and an inflatable playground (including a mammoth mountain) -- all courtesy of the Forbes campaign.
''If it is, we're in bad shape.''
Neglecting those who question the fairness of the balloting, organizers here portrayed it as important as an actual electoral contest.
Mr. Bush assured the crowd, ''I am proud to be here for this grass-roots exercise in democracy.''
Beneath the revelry today, campaigns were partaking in high-stakes politics.
Campaign workers scurried about in golf carts with walkie-talkies and cell phones, sizing up the lines at their rivals' tents.

The event was an organizational test to see which campaigns could persuade the most people to travel far and wide to this event -- and then take the next step to support their candidate.
Any Iowa resident of voting age could participate, a change in the rules that gave this event more credibility than the event four years ago.

In 1995, candidates turned this grass-roots exercise into the campaign equivalent of a Berlin airlift, flying in supporters from around the country.
If sheer resources were any guide to who would triumph, Mr. Forbes would have won hands down.
No one could stop talking about his colossal, air-conditioned tent (with French doors).
''There's a lot of people coming here to get cooled off -- in the Bush tent they come off a little stodgy,'' said Greg Mueller, a spokesman for Mr. Forbes.
''And we have the only kids' stuff -- Forbes family values.''
Referring to the pivotal Iowa caucuses nearly six months from now, when people will actually vote in a binding contest, William Dal Col, the Forbes's campaign manager, said, ''This is all a down payment for a cold night in February.''
''It's like a carnival,'' she said, clutching a Forbes gift bag.
''But it's fun.
Great sport.
Why not?''

Max Eckstein, 22, a college student from Boone, Iowa, who was surveying the band in a Bush tent, said the Governor and other candidates ''must be kicking themselves'' for not air-conditioning their tents.
But, he said, that would not in itself sway him to back Mr. Forbes.
''Do food and entertainment make a difference?''
''Maybe for the common person.''
Some party-goers, while not shy about sampling the food and accepting the free rides on hot air balloons, denounced the extravagance.
''Forbes is trying to appeal to the side of us that says, 'O.K., we can play so he must be good,' '' said Tanya Bignell, a data entry worker from Bettendorf, Iowa, who was backing Senator Hatch.
''Forbes's is probably the best,'' Mr. Moore, 69, said of the entertainment.
She was not put off by the heavy spending, saying, ''That's their business.
You spend your money where you have to.''

''I want to get her more points against Bush to keep her in the race,'' Mr. Endicott said.
But exactly how do you go about calculating the worth of financial derivatives -- securities whose value is derived from an underlying asset, like a stock, bond or currency?
If Goldman Sachs is thinking about buying a basket of 30-year mortgages, for example, how can it grasp the slippery value of such a complicated asset?
Monte Carlo is a broad idea that has since been applied in many different ways in many different fields, from physics to finance.
''Nobody believed in the early 90's that this could be superior to Monte Carlo,'' said Joseph F. Traub, who is a professor of computer science at Columbia University.

Professor Vanderhoof arranged for Goldman Sachs to give Professor Traub a difficult problem -- figuring the value of a collateralized mortgage obligation, which is essentially a collection of 30-year mortgages whose worth is difficult to fix because of varying interest rates and unpredictable prepayments.
Spassimir Paskov, then a graduate student of Professor Traub's, valued the mortgages using both Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo.
Tomorrow, Professor Traub, Professor Vanderhoof and Mr. Paskov will receive a patent for their use of this numerical technique for assessing the value of complex securities like derivatives.
So what is the difference between regular Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo?
To understand, imagine trying to estimate the average depth of a pond.
With Monte Carlo, one would take measurements of the pond's depth at random points.
If the points are plotted on an aerial drawing of the pond, some areas will be pocked with points while other areas will be bare.

With quasi-Monte Carlo, depth measurements are taken at points that have been selected deterministically -- that is, with a formula.
If the points are plotted on an aerial picture of the pond, they will be scattered in an even, patterned fashion, with no bare spots or clusters.
''In quasi-Monte Carlo, the points are chosen uniformly with as few points as possible such that the average of the measured depth is close to the true average depth,'' Professor Traub said.
Why does quasi-Monte Carlo work faster and more accurately than the regular Monte Carlo?
It could have to do with the fact that, when figuring cash flows, near-term variables carry much more weight than variables in the distant future.
''Clearly there is something special about finance problems,'' Professor Traub said.

Mr. Paskov, who is now an associate director in risk management for the investment arm of Barclays Bank, built a software system that uses the quasi-Monte Carlo to value derivatives and other complex securities.
The software, called Finder, is being licensed by Columbia University to investment houses and insurance companies.
Professor Traub, Professor Vanderhoof and Mr. Paskov will receive patent 5,940,810.
Inventor Puts A Fan Underfoot

Norman Landry, an inventor in Boise, Idaho, is cooling his heels -- literally.
The bottom of Mr. Landry's shoe has a tiny turbine sandwiched between two antifreeze-filled compartments.
''Foot movement as the user walks or runs will put pressure on the liquid and make it flow, typically from back to front, and then to back again, the movement of which will cause the turbine to turn,'' Mr. Landry's patent states.
The turbine, in turn, powers miniature fans, which force air through channels either into holes in the bottom of the shoe or upward onto the wearer's ankles.

In the 1960's, all this began to change, as the Eichmann trial raised consciousness of the Holocaust ''as an entity in its own right, distinct from Nazi barbarism in general.''
''After 1967, and particularly after 1973,'' Mr. Novick writes, ''much of the world came to see the Middle East conflict as grounded in the Palestinian struggle to, belatedly, accomplish the U.N.'s original intention.
There were strong reasons for Jewish organizations to ignore all this, however, and instead to conceive of Israel's difficulties as stemming from the world's having forgotten the Holocaust.
The Holocaust framework allowed one to put aside as irrelevant any legitimate grounds for criticizing Israel, to avoid even considering the possibility that the rights and wrongs were complex.''

At the same time, he suggests, the rise of identity politics and the ''culture of victimization'' made it acceptable, even fashionable, for American Jews ''to embrace a victim identity based on the Holocaust.''
It is Mr. Novick's startling contention that while ''there's nothing wrong with the affirmative lessons the Washington Holocaust Museum attempts to teach,'' such lessons ''seem, if not useless, hardly necessary.''
He argues that the very extremity of the Holocaust and ''the extremity of the circumstances in which it unfolded'' seriously ''limit its capacity to provide lessons applicable in our everyday world,'' adding that ''an unintended consequence of our making the Holocaust our central symbol of atrocity'' may in fact be a ''desensitization'' to other cases of mass death.
intervention.''
He does not address the Kosovo crisis at all (though his book may have well gone to press before NATO air strikes began).
Although Mr. Novick has some useful things to say about the dangers of dwelling in the memory of oppression, although he can be eloquent on the sectarian use of the Holocaust as an easy moral touchstone, such observations are completely overshadowed by this volume's deliberate cynicism.
Mr. Novick writes that survivors' memories ''are not a very useful historical source.''
He glibly tosses around phrases like ''the gold medal in the Victimization Olympics'' and ''Jewish moral capital.''
And he asserts that for Jewish organizations intent on capturing the attention of a younger generation, ''the Holocaust looked like the one item in stock with consumer appeal.''
This flippant tone reflects Mr. Novick's determination to not merely demystify the Holocaust, but to diminish its place in the collective imagination.
While he argues that Hitler would triumph if Jews were ''to tacitly endorse his definition'' of them ''as despised pariahs by making the Holocaust the emblematic Jewish experience,'' the words of the scholar Emil Fackenheim remain a potent warning of the real dangers of forgetting the past: ''We are commanded [to remember] the martyrs of the Holocaust, lest their memory perish,'' he declared in 1967.
''We are forbidden .
.
.
to deny or despair of God .
.
.
lest Judaism perish.
.
.
.
To abandon any of these imperatives, in response to Hitler's victory at Auschwitz, would be to hand him yet other, posthumous victories.''

None of these developments were accompanied by fundamental reforms.
''Crony capitalism'' in emerging nations is alive and well.
While leaders of these countries understand the need for sound banking regulation -- the lack of which was a cause of the crisis -- it will take many years to reach Western standards.
The same goes for bankruptcy laws and other necessary foundations for modern capitalism.
There have been no big changes on the global level, either, and last year's debates have lost their intensity.
Should short-term speculations by foreign investors in emerging markets be controlled?
Should private lenders be obligated to help bail out the countries to which they lent too much?

They didn't agree on much, except on one point: we are in for a series of financial crises over the next several years.
Why?
The global system is no stronger than its weakest links.
And there are plenty of them, from Japan, with its sky-high debts, to the tension-ridden emerging countries that are trying to move from closed to open societies.
The executives pointed to widening regulatory gaps as the movement of money outpaced governments' ability to supervise the system.
No one I interviewed would even dare guess when and how the next crisis will arise.
But the most worrisome set of circumstances relates to the United States, which for the last few years has been single-handedly supporting the world economy.
Perhaps recent tremors in many public Internet-related companies -- 40 percent of which were trading below their initial offering price earlier this month -- are telling us something about the sustainability of our soaring market.
Or, could it be that the recent downward pressure on the dollar -- stemming from our soaring trade deficits, or the fact that American investors are moving big money to Europe and elsewhere -- is a sign that something is amiss?
There is also the bond market, where prices have been dropping and rates moving up.
Most important, a weak dollar and a tightening labor market may cause the Fed to increase interest rates for a second time this summer when it meets on Tuesday, or perhaps at its next meeting this fall.
If this trend continues, it could spook the market rather than steady it, and stifle consumer confidence.
A receding tide could expose many problems that have been camouflaged by our sustained growth, like enormous consumer debt or the continued growth of risky, unregulated hedge funds.
There are also some glaring weak spots abroad.
For the past few years China helpfully kept its currency steady, becoming a big island of stability among emerging markets.
But now it is flirting with devaluation, a move that could jeopardize the fragile recoveries of its neighbors by undercutting the prices of their exports.
Argentina, until recently a pillar of strength in South America, is projecting negative growth of 3.5 percent this year.
These are not huge economies.
The point is not to add up everything that could go wrong, but to recognize that globalization implies that everyone and everything is more closely connected than ever before, but on a foundation that is still shaky.
Of course, like last year at this time, our luck may hold.
But it's like playing Russian roulette with some additional bullets loaded in the chamber.
The committee was divided, though, about whether inflation would increase in coming months and whether rates should change.
Andrew Ross Sorkin (NYT)
The trade report is the last significant economic report before Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Tuesday to debate whether short-term interest rates should be raised to slow the economy and prevent inflation from accelerating.
While a widening trade gap can be a drag on economic growth, the surge in imports shows that consumers are continuing their spending spree, while saving so little, a significant concern of the Fed.

Many investors and Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to nudge its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a point, to 5.25 percent.
Cheaper imports have helped keep prices low and inflation in check, so far.
But the dollar has been weaker of late, and many economists contend that the spending spree on imports may help drive up consumer prices.
And sustained record deficits could cause the dollar's value to tumble further, making American stock and bond markets less attractive to foreign investors.
The dollar is now at a seven-month low compared with the yen.
The dollar often falls with a widening trade deficit because investors choose other markets when they see the deficit as a portent of possible problems.
The widening trade gap is also an economic measure that Republicans may seize upon in this campaign season as evidence that all is not well with the American economy.
Sluggish exports are a sign that American manufacturing is weak.
And many American laborers, like steelworkers and Midwestern farmers, consider the widening gap as a bad omen for their personal futures.

''Consumers are spending beyond their personal incomes,'' she said.
''At some point in time, in my estimation roughly two years, the rest of the world will say, 'We're not so happy about lending to you anymore.'

The bipartisan deficit review commission -- with members ranging from Carla A.
The commission plans to report on its findings after holding hearings around the country.
According to the statistics released today, consumers snapped up more foreign automobiles, computer accessories and diamond gems.
The deficit with China widened at a time when the Chinese may soon try to resume talks with the Clinton Administration in their bid to join the World Trade Organization.
The Administration has requested a study of how China's addition to the W.T.O.
would affect the United States economy.
The study is expected to be completed this month, but a spokeswoman at the Office of the United States Trade Representative said the report would most likely remain confidential.
At the hearing in Washington today, Charles L. Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said the increasing deficits could eventually lower Americans' standard of living.
''It is not some catastrophe,'' Mr. Schultze said.
''It will probably take care of itself, but in ways we don't like.''
''Size of course is not everything, but this does show a major change in the mindset of Japanese bank management,'' said J. Brian Waterhouse, an analyst for HSBC James Capel.
''Up until this year, Japanese banks were determined to be independent, and suddenly we have three major banks getting together.''

The announcement caused a surge in bank shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, as investors bet that the 18 major Japanese banks would eventually fall to fewer than half that number and make the survivors far more profitable simply by reducing the number of competitors.
The three-way alliance, which the partners hope to formally establish by the fall of 2000, would create a giant with $1.3 trillion in assets, the benchmark for measuring a bank's size.
It would dwarf the current world leader, Deutsche Bank, which has $866 billion in assets, as well as the biggest bank in the United States, Citigroup, which has $668 billion.
The bank would be twice the size of what is now the largest bank in Japan, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which has about $580 billion in assets.
''Although we will be the world's top bank in terms of assets, we will not remain content just at that,'' Masao Nishimura, Industrial Bank's chief executive, told a news conference.
''We aim to be among the world's top five banks in terms of capital, profits, services and other areas.''
The union of three major Japanese banks comes at a time when there have been signs of a revival in the Japanese economy, which has been experiencing the worst recession since World War II.
The yen, the most visible symbol of the country's economic might, has risen to the strongest levels in seven months.
Japan's stock market has soared this year on a bet by many international investors that the country may finally be turning around.
The banking merger in Japan also comes against a backdrop of consolidation among the biggest banks elsewhere.
Under the Japanese merger deal, the three partners will put their retail banking, investment banking, and brokerage subsidiaries under common management and cut costs by combining overlapping businesses.
The banks said that by uniting, they also expected to save on the huge costs of installing new information technology.
The banks said that once the merger becomes complete they plan to eliminate 6,000 jobs, reducing the entire work force to about 29,000 people, and cut the total number of branches from the current 704 to 620.
''Despite their size, I'm rather skeptical that they can compete on an international scale unless they undertake some serious restructuring,'' said Toru Nakakita, a professor of economics at Toyo University.
''I hate to say this but I think we've created another Titanic: we have the biggest bank in the world but it's certainly not the most competitive.''
Others said that unless such mergers make banks more profitable, they would not help the banks absorb the hundreds of billions of dollars in bad debts that still litter their books.
The Government has sought to help by cutting interest rates to nearly zero, which lowers the cost of borrowing for the banks, and has injected money into the largest banks to strengthen them.
But many of these old debts, vestiges of loans made during the speculative real estate boom in the 1980's, will never be repaid.

''It's evident that this Government is better at reforming the banking system than previous governments,'' said Mary Davis, chief economist for emerging markets in Asia at Credit Suisse First Boston in London.
If such mergers strengthen the banks she said, ''it could be a significant development, but they've had this enormous bad-debt problem which they have just begun to address and there's so much more to do.''
''Regulators think that there are too many banks in Japan, so merging banks makes it easier to improve profits,'' said Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.
''I'd be surprised if the Government tries to block this.''
Indeed, Hakuo Yanagisawa, chairman of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, Japan's regulatory body, said: ''We sincerely welcome the move, which meets expectations for creating a top-notch institution from Japan that can withstand stiff international competition.''
The three banks are among 15 major Japanese banks that received 7.5 trillion yen (about $675 billion) in public funds from the Government to help resolve their huge loan problems.

In exchange for the cash infusion, the banks agreed to revamp their operations and become more profitable.
The banks are now under pressure to make good on those promises.
Officials of the three banks that plan to unite said today that they would concentrate investment in computer systems for payment settlements, management of data bases, credit risk assessments and other electronic banking operations.
Most Japanese banks are far behind their foreign competitors in the use of computer systems.
Under the agreement, the three banks will jointly establish a holding company by the fall of 2000.
Bank operations will be gradually integrated into the holding company over two years.
Individual shares of the three banks will be exchanged for a new share in the holding company, which will be listed on stock exchanges after the three banks exit the exchanges, the banks said.
Two other major Japanese banks confirmed today their intention to combine operations under a similar holding company arrangement, which could also lead to a merger.
The combined assets of the two banks are about $531 billion, which would make the new entity Japan's second-largest bank and the seventh largest worldwide.
''It's not scale that we are aiming for in this union,'' said Tsuyoshi Yamashita, a spokesman for Tokei Bank.
''We are investing in our ability to offer customers a wider range of products.
For example, it's too costly for us to do investment banking alone, so we are seeking mutual effectiveness with our merger.''
If that happens, it is unclear what the effect might be on housing prices.
Some believe that the tax, coupled with other factors, could result in lower prices; others, however, believe that a tighter housing market could push prices higher.

The tax measure, proposed by County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta as the cornerstone of a plan to help solve the county's growing deficit -- as much as $300 million by some accounts -- is designed with hopes that it will add $60 million to the county's coffers.
But that all depends on a continued strong real estate market.
The combination of the tax and rising mortgage interest rates may begin to dampen sales and force prices to retreat, officials said.
''But its impact could lead to slower home sales, especially now that interest rates have passed the 8 percent mark,'' she said.
''I think home sales will slow in any case,'' she said.
''Most sellers and buyers have been trying to beat the increase in interest rates.
At a rate of 8 percent or higher, many buyers can no longer afford as much house.
The tax only adds to the problem.''
The Long Island Board of Realtors led a coalition of organizations opposed to the tax, including the Long Island Association, the Association for a Better Long Island and the Long Island Housing Partnership.
The coalition ran full-page newspaper ads calling for budget reform in Nassau, not more taxes.
''Nassau County's fiscal crisis is serious and demands creative solutions,'' said Randy Kaplan, a spokesman for the Board of Realtors.
''Solely adding new taxes to one of the most already overtaxed counties in America is not one of them.''
Dr. Kamer described the tax as inequitable in that it falls on one class -- home sellers.
''And it's not an ideal revenue source for the county,'' she said.
''It only lasts for 18 months and will not impress those who rate the county's bonds.''
The bonds are just two basis points from junk-bond status.
Opponents say the tax is harmful to both home sellers and home buyers in Nassau.
They say that what is needed is a complete overhaul of the county's real state assessment system, not just a one-time tax fix.
They note that each year, the county pays millions of dollars in refunds because of errors in an assessment system that is based on 1938 property values and is the cause of a significant number of tax judgments against the county in which property owners get refunds, with interest.
The assessment system is also the target of a Federal lawsuit, which charges that the system discriminates against minority homeowners.

Mr. Gulotta, meanwhile, remains steadfast in support of the assessment system and his new tax.
''This legislation, adopted with support from both Democrats and Republicans in Albany, as well as an overwhelming majority of the Nassau County Legislature, is important to the fiscal health of the county and is part of an overall plan to insure its long-term fiscal health,'' he said in a statement released by his office.
''It is impossible to predict at this time whether any extension will be sought,'' he said.
''We will be submitting a budget to the County Legislature in about a month, which must be adopted by the end of October.
Once that budget is implemented, and we monitor the expenditures and revenues in the next year, we will be in a better position to do such an analysis.''
Mr. Gulotta, a Republican who will be seeking re-election next year, is said by his critics to be pursuing a course of proposing measures that offend the fewest potential voters.
Although Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in the county by three to two, Mr. Gulotta is widely seen as being in trouble because of the county's fiscal crisis at a time when its economy is enjoying a boom.
Homeowners who now hope to cash in on the boom by selling their homes at a time of record-high prices are potential voters, but only if they plan to remain in the county.
If they are retirees heading, for example, to Florida or Arizona once they sell their homes, they will have no way of voting against Mr. Gulotta for the extra tax they must pay on leaving.
County statistics indicate that between a quarter and a third of all home sellers leave the county.
The sellers will be able to list the tax payment as a local real estate tax deduction on their Federal income tax form, but for many retirees, it will be another bite out of their nest egg, according to opponents of the tax.
Real estate brokers and lawyers say the tax will no doubt be shared or passed along to buyers, especially in the current market, where they often end up in bidding wars and pay well above the asking price because of the limited number of homes on the market.

Brokers say they will also feel the pinch.
Instead of taking the traditional 6 percent of the final price, they may be forced by sellers to take 5 percent to help pay for the transfer tax and close a deal.
Sellers of high-priced homes, especially those in the million-dollar range, are rethinking their plans to enter or stay in the present market so long as the transfer tax is in effect, brokers said.

While some buyers are being forced out of the market by steadily rising prices, those who remain are not only encouraged by the continuing strength of the economy, but are also backed by heavy profits from a still bullish Wall Street.
Not even rising interest rates have curbed their desire to buy.
''But none of us has a crystal ball and can't say how long this is going to last or how the new tax will impact the market,'' said Kathy Borg, a director of the Long Island Board of Realtors and a broker for Daniel Gale Associates in Locust Valley, which like other agencies had a rush of clients hoping to beat the new tax.
''The real estate market is cyclical and is based on supply and demand, and right now we don't have the inventory to meet demand.
''All our sellers are still serious about selling, despite the tax,'' she said.
''Many of them are relocating and their plans have been in motion for many months.
As of now, no one has pulled out.''
''The county should have held the line on spending,'' he said.
''These things catch up with you if you don't correct them when you have the chance.''
According to data based on real estate sales in 1998, Mr. Parola said the tax may provide Nassau with as much as $60 million in revenue.
''But that all depends on a continuing high rate of sales at high prices,'' he said.

''If some people now decide to put off their sales until the end of January 2001, then the county's share would be less,'' he said.
''It's too early to say whether the tax and rising rates will have a chilling effect on the market.''
''But remember, home sales in Nassau over the last four years have seen a dramatic increase, and now homeowners find themselves sitting on a large equity.
Many may still decide to jump in, despite the tax, even if they are retirees.
They can get a break on their Federal taxes and still make a profit.''
He added, ''You can't balance a budget with a lot of false one-shot gimmicks.''
''The risk is high that the tax will not produce the projected revenues,'' he said.
''There are those sellers who may now say, 'I'm not going to give the county any more than I have to,' and wait another 18 months before they enter the market.''
''Clearly, what's needed in Nassau is a well-thought out budget and an end to phony one-shot revenues,'' he said.
''This tax hurts the real estate market in general,'' said Mr. Boyle, a real estate lawyer.
''Even though I'm from Suffolk County, people selling homes anywhere think such a tax is unfair.
''And the rate, 1 percent, is a very high rate.
It's out of pocket, and you pay just because you happen to live in Nassau.''
''But it's just to early to say how this will all impact the market,'' he said.
''The problem now is that there are tons of people looking to buy and not enough to go around.
Things could get even tighter if some sellers decide to wait until the tax sunsets, and that could push prices even higher.
Then again, higher interest rates could work to push them lower.''
The protesters' acts of destruction, while illegal and extreme, are an expression of the widespread opposition to the introduction of genetically modified crops in Europe and particularly in Britain.

Genetic modification of food has been a relatively unquestioned phenomenon in the United States and Canada, with altered ingredients in a range of processed food from soft drinks to beer to breakfast cereals.
It is also common in animal feeds and soya, corn and cotton seeds.
But its arrival here has set off alarms and united demonstrators from lapsed causes into a powerful protest movement against what they call ''Frankenstein food'' and the large multinational companies promoting it.
There is no government agency in Europe of the regulatory rigor of the United States Food and Drug Administration to build consumer confidence, and government approval can arouse as much suspicion as it can provide reassurance.
This is nowhere truer than in Britain, where the public is sensitized by the outbreak of mad cow disease in 1996 and the Government's tardy conclusion that it was something that could harm humans.
''Let's face it, there are a lot of considerations in Britain that don't apply elsewhere,'' Mr. Fiddaman said, ''the fact that we are an island, the fact that agriculture is not spread out across broad spaces but is close to inhabited areas, and the whole tradition here of wanting to keep land pure and unspoiled even by conventional agriculture.''
A new MORI poll says 79 percent of the British public think that genetically modified crop testing of the kind Mr. Fiddaman has agreed to should be stopped.
Major food manufacturers, supermarkets and fast food chains have already announced the removal of all genetically modified ingredients from their products sold in Britain.
The Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, though on record as in favor of genetically modified foods, has been forced by political pressure to impose a set of largely unenforceable regulations on food outlets demanding that they identify on menus items that may have traces of genetically modified soya or wheat.
One of the central tenets of Mr. Blair's self-described ''modernizing'' program is the determination to see Britain become a country in the forefront of technological innovation, and he has been caught out by the furor over genetically modified food.
The British press has seen the issue as one for crusading journalism, and the scare headlines and wide publicity given to selected scientific studies alleging danger prompted Mr. Blair to accuse newspapers and broadcasters of fomenting ''hysteria'' and ''skewing'' coverage away from the more numerous studies finding no fault with genetically modified food.

It has been a moment where the Blair Government's vaunted ability to capture the public mood has failed it, in the process reinforcing some underlying concerns about the otherwise popular Government -- that it is cocky, beholden to big business and subservient to the United States.
The issue of scientifically altered food is the subject of a growing political dispute between Europe and America.
The World Trade Organization has declared the European ban unjustified because there is no scientific evidence that hormone-treated beef is unhealthy.
Monsanto, the American food company behind much of the genetically modified food in Britain, has seen a large public relations program aimed at halting its demonization by the British public have just the opposite effect.
The genetic modification at issue is a way of adding genes that confer resistance to insect, fungal and viral pests to plants that might otherwise die or require heavy doses of pesticides.
It can also, as in the case of Mr. Fiddaman's crops, foster herbicide-resistance, meaning that weeds can be killed with a single spray that leaves the crops standing.

Objections to genetically modified food rest on the broad claims that genetic manipulation is an act against nature, that the food it produces is dangerous and that its cultivation damages the environment.
There is scant scientific evidence to support any of these conclusions, and farmers like Mr. Fiddaman argue that only field tests, the procedure the protesters seek to halt, can come up with rational answers to people's worries.
The protesters who have destroyed test sites say letting them proceed would allow the escape of transplanted genes from crops to related wild species and contaminate the environment.
Recent laboratory studies at Cornell University showing that monarch butterflies were stunted and killed by eating pollen from genetically modified corn received enormous attention here.
Sir Robert May, a noted biologist who is the Government's chief scientist, called Dr. Pusztai's research ''garbage.''
The scare has mobilized a late-arriving consumer movement in Britain and galvanized people with broad anti-establishment concerns beyond food safety, ranging from anger at the growing industrialization and corporate control of British agriculture to opposition to the construction of new highways in rural areas.
Mr. Fiddaman, 54, has been farming the same land since 1971.
He pointed past a tractor and a tool shed to the field where he is about to start planting genetically modified winter oil seed rape.
''The protesters say they believe these crops may be dangerous, but they refuse to let us go forward with the testing to see if they are right,'' he said.
''If I am wrong, I'll have to accept that,'' he said, ''but I wouldn't be offering the fields if I thought it was going to produce contamination.''
The owners of adjacent fields have backed his decision.
The seeds come from AgrEvo, a German joint venture of Hoechst A.G. and Schering A.G.
They give the plants a tolerance for a herbicide that kills all the weeds around them, thereby allowing Mr. Fiddaman to reduce the amount of pesticides he will be spraying.
Genetically modified food promoters argue that in this way their produce actually benefits the environment.
Scientists will be visiting unannounced throughout the yearlong process, and their findings will go to the government technical bodies judging the tests.
The police have been caught by surprise or unawares in past attacks, which are often conducted at night by people in full body anti-contamination suits and goggles.
The owner of the field, William Brigham, 59, said: ''This has nothing to do with genetically modified organisms.
It's whether we want democratic government in this country or anarchy.''
The local police have promised Mr. Fiddaman a quick response if he calls with reports of trespassers.

''But there's not much I can do,'' he said, ''The fields are only protected by hedgerows.
I don't mind their opposing the tests, but I find their vandalism abhorrent.
If they want to come and stand over there with protest flags, I don't mind.
But they shouldn't trash the land.''

With the election that far in the future, many things can obviously happen in the meantime.
Still, Mr. Gomes's proposal has generated energetic discussion here over the dynamics of Brazil's domestic debt.
That debt is different from debt owed by the governments in advanced economies like the United States, which are able to sell bonds with maturities of up to 30 years.
Brazil, by contrast, is only able to sell bonds domestically with maturities up to five years.
And the average maturity of all Brazilian Government debt is only about nine months.
The main reason for such short maturities is a reluctance by investors to buy longer-maturing bonds, given a history over the last couple of decades of the national and some state governments reneging on obligations.
''Brazil's track record is not particularly stellar in this regard,'' said Fergus McCormick, a debt analyst at the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Corporation.
A country's domestic debt rating is usually higher than the rating on its foreign debt, or debt owed in foreign currency to lenders in other countries.
But in Brazil's case, Duff & Phelps rates its domestic debt B-, three notches below its foreign debt rating of BB-.

Some of the financiers' and bond analysts' apprehension reflects a worrisome growth of Brazilian domestic debt, which is held almost entirely by Brazilians.
In the last two years, the domestic debt has ballooned to nearly 400 billion reais -- now about $205 billion -- from 210 billion reais.
The main reason for the near-doubling of the domestic debt load is the Government's reliance on bonds that pay a variable rate of interest.
And Brazil's debt makeup is still largely dependent on moves in interest rates, with more than half of domestic debt linked to the main overnight lending rate, now around 19 percent.
An additional 26 percent of the debt is linked to the real's value in relation to the dollar.
That means that a sharp weakening in the Brazilian currency would sharply increase the cost of servicing these bonds.

Mr. Gomes's debt-restructuring proposal reflects the thinking of Roberto Mangabeira Unger, a legal theorist who is his principal adviser.
Mr. Unger, a Brazilian who has been teaching at Harvard Law School since 1971, argues that the nature of Brazil's domestic debt means that it is vulnerable to potential negative developments abroad, like a correction on Wall Street or apprehension over Year 2000 computer problems.
Turbulence abroad could lead the Brazilian central bank to raise rates, which means that the Government's financing costs also rise.
''The Government has made a very dangerous bet by not considering the eventuality of an internal debt reorganization,'' Mr. Unger said in a telephone interview.
''First, it means that almost the totality of projected federal revenue will be used in servicing the debt, and second, the commitments to economic opening and fiscal realism are put at risk.''
Mr. Unger's views on Government finances and other subjects such as the possibility of using controls to limit short-term capital flows have been known for some time.
But recently, they have gained prominence as Mr. Gomes, the 2002 presidential aspirant, became something of a darling in the Brazilian news media after his separation from his first wife and much-publicized romance with Patricia Pillar, a soap-opera actress.
Skeptics say that a debt renegotiation would be exceedingly complex and do more harm than good.
Mailson da Nobrega, a former Finance Minister, said about 80 percent of Brazil's domestic debt is indirectly held by the country's middle class, either through mutual funds, pension funds or insurance policies backed by Government bonds.
''How do you renegotiate with crowds that would fit into several soccer stadiums?''
''This is an idea thought up in a Harvard library, far from Brazilian reality.''
Brazil's central bank has said that the debt situation is improving.
For example, in August the Government was able to increase to 11.7 percent the share of debt that is not subject to variable rates, from 1.2 percent in March.
And with the authorities forecasting a decline in interest rates to single-digits next year, debt-servicing costs should decline, as a result.

Bond market traders, uncertain whether to view the employment report as a harbinger or an anomaly, left interest rates unchanged.
And the 3.8 percent wage rise over the last 12 months is roughly what wage growth for production workers has been all year: firm but not yet firm enough to push employers into inflationary price increases.
''The only thing that would make the wage growth potentially inflationary -- and this is a big if -- is if productivity were to slow from its present strong growth rate,'' said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard University labor economist.
A rising productivity rate has meant that workers have produced more each hour on the job.
The added revenue from their output has paid in effect for their wage increases.
What Ms. Lazar saw in the employment report was evidence that rising interest rates in recent months, as well as a flat stock market, rising oil prices and a sharp drop in the number of households refinancing mortgages are beginning to take their toll on the real economy.
But the September employment report is the first significant evidence of that toll.

''Certainly in 2000 we expect the economy to slow,'' said Martin Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.
''But except for this report there is no other sign of slowing now.''
The goal was to head off speculation that September would have been a strong employment month if not for Floyd.
Without the hurricane, job growth would have been only 50,000.
''That is still slower growth.''

While industrial production rose last month, manufacturing employment fell once again, this time by 21,000 jobs.
Over the last 18 months, manufacturing employment has shrunk by 532,000 jobs, to 18.4 million.
To keep production up with fewer workers, companies have resorted to labor-saving technology and equipment, as well as overtime for the remaining people.
The overtime in manufacturing helps to explain the steady rise in average hourly wages for production workers.
Many of the people displaced from these jobs, on the other hand, have probably moved into lower-paying service jobs, economists say, helping to damp wage growth.
In its monthly wage calculations, the Labor Department counts only production workers, mainly in manufacturing, and not the wages of nonproduction service workers.
Nor does it include bonus payments, which have been widespread across the labor force, but are easier than wages to scale back when business declines.
''Our forecast,'' he said, ''is that compensation will rise by more than 4.5 percent in the third quarter, still high but not as high.''
Why the current crunch?
For most leveraged-buyout specialists, trouble began last July when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that the central bank would be willing to put the brakes on the economy by raising interest rates and tightening the supply of money available to borrowers.
They began pulling their money out of the funds that specialize in such investments.
As the pool of money to lend contracted, interest rates on junk bonds rose two to three percentage points, from roughly 9 to 11 percent to 12 to 14 percent, depending on the bond.

That is making it more expensive for leveraged-buyout financiers to borrow money.
And to complicate matters, Mr. O'Hara said, some lenders are not only demanding higher interest rates, but are also asking for an equity stake of as much as 5 percent in smaller companies involved in buyout deals.
That makes borrowing money an even more expensive proposition for the leveraged-buyout financiers, because it means sharing part of their ultimate profit with the lenders.
''Now they are forced to use money of their own, instead of borrowing it,'' said Kingman Penniman, president of KDP Investment Advisers in Montpelier, Vt. ''They don't want to do that, or worse, give away a big piece of the company they are trying to buy.''

What market watchers like Mr. Penniman have seen is the widening of the spread, or the difference between yields on high-yield bonds and on Treasury bonds.
By Friday, the spread had widened by nearly a full percentage point, to 4.67, with the high-yield index averaging 10.7 percent, compared with 6.03 percent on 10-year Treasuries.
''We've only seen spreads this wide for a short time, during the Russian default and the hedge fund debacle of last year,'' Mr. Penniman said.
''It's way above what we've experienced historically.''
Other concerns seem to be adding to the market nervousness, notably the fears that Year 2000 computer glitches will cause market disruptions that will play out detrimentally for bonds and bond holders.
The validity of those fears remains unclear, though some lenders have warned customers that it will be difficult to finance highly leveraged transactions near the end of the year.
''When people talk about Y2K, I look at the equity markets and I think, why aren't they concerned?''
To add to that, the default rate on junk bonds is climbing and is now running ahead of last year's rate, further dampening investor interest.
As a result, bond investors are pouring their money primarily into the market for higher-quality bonds that offer more safety.
IN the short term, smaller buyout shops will suffer the most.
Banks and other lenders have already put some of these customers on notice.
By contrast, well-known and respected buyout financiers like Clayton, Dubilier & Rice are the least likely to be affected.
''But now that is not as easy.''
As a result, Mr. Barbe added, ''what will drive the market is quality transactions of size.''
At a Roman Catholic nursing home in Albany a year ago, the order of Carmelite nuns that runs it broke from tradition by asking the aged applicants who were about to become residents: ''What time do you like to get up in the morning?
When do you like to have breakfast?
What do you like to eat?''
Now, the Jewish Home in Rochester, N.Y., has begun making changes, too.
The point is to try to shape daily life around the needs and preferences of the residents, rather than the institution's.
In an industry where 1.6 million old people, two-thirds of them impoverished and 70 percent suffering from dementia, live mostly in hospital-style buildings, it is a revolutionary idea.
It is also not surprising, in an industry increasingly dominated by corporate chain ownership, that the changes are occurring in nonprofit, church-sponsored homes.
After $23 million was spent on the gradual reconstruction of its buildings, Fairport Baptist Homes had a grand opening in August of its new architecture, in which 9, 10 or 12 residents live in single rooms clustered around big open kitchens, living rooms and dining areas, with the Alzheimer's patients mixed in.
The residents are allowed to eat and sleep and dress according to their habits, and each cluster of rooms has a staff to nurse, feed, launder and care for those in need.
Dogs and children are brought to visit.
Plants grow everywhere.
The noise level, the drug level, the wandering and the number of patients in restraints are all down.
The effect on operating costs has yet to be seen.
For such humane changes to be copied by for-profit homes, the finances would have to work.
But the chains are showing interest, sending representatives to visit church homes and attend conferences.
Rightly or wrongly, nursing homes have come to have a terrible reputation among the old.
No one wants to end up there.
The homes with the worst financial troubles at the moment -- and the most consistent patterns of resident abuse -- are the for-profit homes.
Some real, caring changes could do them a world of good.

His experiments focused on the two tools that governments use to affect their economic health: monetary policy, which involves changes in interest rates and the money supply, and fiscal policy, the sum of a government's budget and tax decisions.
His conclusion, according to the citation released yesterday by the academy in Stockholm, was that ''under a floating exchange rate, monetary policy becomes powerful and fiscal policy powerless, whereas the opposite is true when the exchange rate is fixed.''
''In those days, you could actually teach about closed economic models -- today it would be ludicrous to do so.''

''By 1980, then-candidate Ronald Reagan had become persuaded about what Robert Mundell was saying -- and the rest is history.''
On his Web site yesterday, he predicted that the honor would give Professor Mundell ''the standing to consolidate the supply-side revolution he began.''
Professor Mundell has also contributed substantially to the emergence of a common currency for Europe, said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University.
''He started people on the road to realizing that it is very, very hard to go to a fixed exchange rate without a common currency,'' Professor Rogoff said.
More recently, Professor Mundell has generated controversy by encouraging a return to a system of fixed exchange rates, similar to the arrangement established after World War II that called for the value of world currencies to be tied to the United States dollar, which in turn could be redeemed for gold.
One recent paper, published by the Center for Economic Policy Studies at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa., is entitled, ''The International Monetary System in the 21st Century: Could Gold Make a Comeback?''
But if exchange rates and monetary policy conjure up an image of a tedious ideologue, nothing could be further from reality, the professor's colleagues and friends said.
''He is decidedly not a nerd,'' Professor Dornbusch said.
Professor Mundell earned his doctorate in economics in 1956 from M.I.T., after spending a year at the London School of Economics.
He joined Columbia's faculty in 1974, establishing himself in a rambling book-filled apartment in Morningside Heights.
Colleagues and proteges have come to covet invitations to his second home, Santa Colomba, an ancient Tuscan villa in Monteriggioni, near Siena, which he purchased from the Catholic Church about 30 years ago and has been slowly restoring to its Renaissance glory.
And a visit to the professor's home page at Columbia's Web site reveals his latest fascination: his baby son, Nicholas, his photogenic offspring from a second marriage.
He has three grown children from an earlier marriage, which ended in divorce in 1972.

Correction: October 22, 1999, Friday An article in Business Day on Oct. 14 about the awarding of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science to Robert A. Mundell misstated the amount.
This year's award is valued at $976,000, not $1 million.
That act requires banks to make loans to minorities, residents of inner cities, farmers and others who have historically had trouble getting credit.
For years, a central stumbling block to overhauling the system has been an arcane regulatory turf fight between the Treasury Department's Comptroller of the Currency, which supervises nationally chartered banks, and the Fed, which oversees bank holding companies.
By allowing insurers, bankers and investment bankers to enter each other's business, any new legislation would have to prescribe a corporate structure for the new financial conglomerates, and as such, would ultimately dictate which agency had primacy.
The debate traces its roots to the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the tension that followed between the Fed and the executive branch over both of the banks and the carrying out of economic policy.

The issue now has no practical significance for either consumers or most banks.
But it has been an enduring struggle between two of Washington's power centers.
The squabbling between a long line of Treasury secretaries and Fed chairmen had inevitably stalled any efforts at trying to eliminate the legislation adopted during the Great Depression and later that has limited the cross-ownership of banks, insurers and investment banks.
The Fed wanted financial service conglomerates to keep their banking, insurance and securities functions separate and under the umbrella of a holding company.
The Treasury proposed giving banking companies the option of organizing financial service companies as operating subsidiaries of the parent company.
One was that the central bank would be unable to carry out monetary policy without some control over a large portion of the banks.
Mr. Greenspan also maintained that financial conglomerates should organize under a holding company so as to prevent the banks from using certain Government subsidies to their advantage as they expand into new areas like investment banking and insurance.
Those subsidies include deposit insurance backed by the Federal Government, access to credit through the discount window and a Federal clearinghouse.
The agreement brokered a few hours after midnight this morning by Mr. Summers and Mr. Greenspan is as complex as you would expect to get from the two economic engineers and Ph.D.'s.

Administration officials said that under the compromise, both agencies would continue to play significant roles in overseeing the nation's banks and emerging financial conglomerates.
The deal provides for operating subsidiaries of banks to underwrite securities.
After five years, a subsidiary could also engage in merchant banking activities if jointly approved by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.
Banks interested in insurance underwriting and real estate development would have to set up separate affiliates.
The agreement also imposes certain other financial safeguards intended to protect the banking components of a financial conglomerate because those units have insured deposits ultimately backed by the Federal Government.
The agreement requires, for instance, that the aggregate asset value of the financial subsidiaries of a bank not be greater than 80 percent of the bank's assets.
And the equity capital in the subsidiaries cannot be greater than 20 percent of the bank's equity capital.
Finally, the assets of all the financial subsidiaries of a bank would not be able to exceed $50 billion.

Indeed, since the earnings reporting period began in earnest last week, the S.& P. 500 has fallen 6.6 percent.
Still, sectors with stronger-than-average profit growth are more likely to weather the effects of higher rates than those that underperform.

I.B.E.S.
expects the third-quarter winners to be led by energy companies, benefiting from the sharp rise in oil prices, with operating profits up 41 percent.
And because conditions were so poor in 1998, profits at financial services companies should look much better, too, up an estimated 34.9 percent.
Consumer cyclical companies, beneficiaries of shoppers' torrid spending, should see earnings rise 33.3 percent.
And technology companies should do well, despite fears about Year 2000 computer problems; analysts expect their earnings to rise 31 percent.
In fact, no sector is projected to show negative earnings growth for the period, though transportation companies are expected to show a profit increase of just 1.3 percent.
''People have been talking for a long time about how good third-quarter earnings were going to be,'' said Sam Stovall, a senior investment strategist at Standard & Poor's.
''Now that earnings are coming in as expected, investors are saying 'good.'
It's a little like a kid who wakes up Christmas morning and gets everything he wants.''
The Grinch in the earnings story, Mr. Stovall said, is the Federal Reserve Board: ''If worries about the Fed raising interest rates were not there, then I believe stock prices would have upside potential.''

MOST analysts agree that profit growth should remain strong in the fourth quarter.
But when talk turns to 2000, opinions start to diverge.
Mr. Ratajczak and other economists expect profit growth to slow sharply next year, as a combination of higher interest rates, rising employee costs and a slowdown in consumption bites into the bottom line.
''You can't have consumption continue like this forever,'' Mr. Ratajczak said.
''Profit growth will be slightly negative next year due to higher labor costs, higher finance charges and slower revenue growth.''
Next year, profits ''are going to get hit from all sides,'' said Joseph Carson, chief fixed-income economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.

Thomas M. McManus, equity portfolio strategist at Banc of America Securities and a longtime profits bull, disagreed.
Mr. McManus said profit growth next year would slow slightly from the 20 percent increase he expects for the third and fourth quarter, but not much.
''We think operating earnings will rise by 15 percent or better next year,'' he said.
Mr. McManus said the increase in interest rates, wage rates and commodity prices would prove temporary, and that bonds would rally.
Moreover, he said that profits in 1998 and 1999 have been depressed by investments that corporations have made in preparation for 2000.
Those investments will start to pay off next year, he said.
''I am looking for a bond market rally to shift some stock market laggards into overdrive,'' he said, pointing to four stock sectors: financial services, health care, consumer nondurables and utilities, all of which are suffering because of higher rates.

Instead, he had to be satisfied with his first multigoal game.
''I think I was a little snakebit the last couple of games.
''But you know that he's going to get on track.''
One has to wonder if the same can be said about the Rangers' inexplicably punchless power play, which went 0 for 3 and is now 3 for 39 on the season, second to last in the 28-team National Hockey League.
They also received a sterling performance from Richter, who has a slightly protruding disk in his lower back and had missed the last five games.
''I really do believe it's something that is behind me,'' Richter said of his bothersome injury.
''They wouldn't have let me go unless they felt I could pass each step along the way.''

Directors of the Rite Aid Corporation stepped in yesterday in an effort to stem a series of disasters at the nation's third-largest drugstore chain, ousting Martin L. Grass, the chief executive, announcing that the company will restate $500 million in pretax earnings since 1997 and placing control with four independent board members.
Despite the huge restatement, some analysts said that the moves, taken as a whole, may be good news for investors.
''The directors and the banks must have been very upset and frustrated and lacked confidence in current management's ability to control this business.''

While the earnings restatement is severe, Mr. Husson said, investors should be relieved that the lead banks agreed to the extension.

Neither Mr. Grass, 45, the son of company founder, Alex Grass, nor Mr. Noonan, 57, could be reached for comment.
The company had said earlier that the restatements would cover issues including changes ''in the accrual for non-cancelable lease obligations relating to closed stores and to reflect non-cash charges related to a change in the company's method of accounting for impaired assets.''
Mr. Green will join the directors' executive committee after his investment closes, the company said.
The preferred stock he will receive will pay an 8 percent pay-in-kind dividend -- meaning dividends will come in the form of more preferred stock.

At the same time, however, the United States deficit with China soared to $6.9 billion, the largest ever with any country, from $6.3 billion in July.
This prompted a fresh expression of unhappiness in Washington, where support for China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization seem to be fading.
''U.S.-China trade remains a troubling story,'' William Daley, the Commerce Secretary, said yesterday.
Mr. Daley said that at talks set in Seattle next month he would keep pressing the Chinese to remove obstacles to American companies seeking to do business there.
''Everywhere you look, you see stuff made in China,'' said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Securities, adding that the primary ''culprit'' causing the widening of the nation's trade imbalance in previous months was recession in Asia rather than any lack of competitiveness on the part of American business, as was the case in the 1980's.
The Government's statistics on trade between individual countries, which are not adjusted for normal seasonal variation, also showed that the deficit with Japan shrank in August to $6.4 billion, from $6.8 billion in July.

This was the eighth consecutive monthly rise in imports, reflecting the continued domestic boom and by far the largest of three consecutive gains in exports.
''We're starting to see evidence of global healing,'' Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, said.
Still, while encouraged by rising exports, he said the trade deficit could easily expand again in coming months since exports must grow 30 percent faster than imports at current levels merely to keep it steady.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

James E. Annable, chief economist at Wingspanbank.com, also expressed concern about the impact of American consumers' strong demand for foreign goods.
If this doesn't subside, he said, the deficit could swell enough that the dollar would weaken, tending to bring inflation, higher interest rates or both.
For now, though, the deficit raises far fewer alarms than it did in the 1980's; it is less than 3 percent of gross domestic product, about half a percentage point less than a decade ago.
That is largely because American industry is making immense investments in new equipment that should raise productivity.
Moreover, consumers are likely to slow spending since rising interest rates have nearly ended home refinancings which, along with the stock market, had helped fuel the current binge.
''We're not in the worst of all worlds yet,'' Mr. Annable said.
The biggest rise in imports in August was for industrial supplies and materials -- mainly crude petroleum that has risen sharply in price this year.
IS Alan Greenspan yesterday's hero?
Politicians fell all over themselves to praise the Federal Reserve chairman while interpreting his sometimes Delphic words as an endorsement of their views.
But now his halo is slipping, and the muttering is increasing.
How dare he raise interest rates?
Who is he to question the stock market's valuation?
William McChesney Martin Jr., the Fed chairman during the great economic expansion of the 1950's and 1960's, once said that the role of the Fed was ''to take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going.''
Mr. Greenspan is learning what happens to Fed officials who wait too long to try to grab the bowl.
The revelers resent it.
Deep into the longest peacetime recovery in American history, business feels it has a right to continued economic growth more or less forever.
Deep into the biggest bull market ever, more and more investors believe that 20 percent-plus annual stock market gains are a birthright.
In 1929, the Fed had the gall to tell banks to reduce lending to stock speculators.
The Fed, it added, ''can act the part of a bull in a china shop and cause a lot of destruction and damage, or, Samson-like, it can pull the whole financial structure down about its head.
But that is no reason why it should not be checked in the attempt by those who would be involved in the ruin.''

That Fed quickly lost its nerve.
The stock market rallied more than 30 percent from the March lows brought on by the Fed's effort to slow speculation.

Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed face a difficult situation now.
There is scattered evidence that the economy is slowing, and there is reason to believe that the current rate of growth is overstated because it reflects inventory accumulation by people and companies fearful of Year 2000 glitches.
Both are reasons not to raise rates.
On the other side, there is equally scattered evidence that inflation is rising, and there is concern over the soaring current account deficit.
A failure to act could cause stock prices to rise to completely unreasonable levels, making an eventual crash more likely.
Action, on the other hand, might scare jittery investors and bring on a crash.
Because it no longer pays attention to margins, the Fed has created the impression that stock prices are irrelevant and that inflation is the only reason to apply economic brakes.
Without clear evidence of inflation, Mr. Greenspan risks losing popularity if he keeps raising rates.
Will Mr. Greenspan do the same?
Consumers stand to gain from the convenience of finding every financial product they need in one place, often for less money than they are accustomed to paying.
But consumer groups have already begun to raise red flags about privacy in a world in which the same company insures a customer for both sickness and early death, or tracks how much debt a client is incurring through mortgages, credit cars and margin loans.
The financial provider as big brother might theoretically discriminate against providing life insurance for people with shaky medical histories, or inundate those who owe lots of money with high-cost loans.

The concept of one-stop shopping, of course, is not a new one.
American Express, the credit card company, already lets clients trade stocks.
Merrill Lynch already provides home mortgages and business loans.
But while counterexamples abound, the practical difficulties of cross-selling and merging across industry lines have kept American financial companies from selling the broad range of products their European counterparts do.
In particular, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act will make it far easier for banks, insurers and brokerage firms to introduce new lines of business without going through legal loopholes like setting up subsidiaries in Bermuda to underwrite insurance polices or buying savings and loan companies to sell bank-like products through the back door.
''Over time, as firms fully understand the implications of this change, it will stimulate consolidation,'' said David H. Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch.
''For us and the other major securities firms, it clearly opens a range of strategic alternatives.''
Few expect the financial landscape to change overnight.
Consumers tend to remain loyal to their local bank or family stockbroker longer than economic models predict.
Moreover, some banks may not want to sell health insurance anymore than the Gap wants to sell television sets.
But the catch phrase in banking is ''deepening share of wallet.''
When a bank is already paying rent for a branch office and a brokerage firm is paying the salary of a broker, they welcome the chance to pump more goods through existing channels.
''We will start to see the emergence of the universal bank -- all financial services under one corporation,'' said Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant.
He said the new legislation provided fertile soil for combinations involving bankers and insurers.
''I think it's highly likely that you would see a wave of mergers there.''
American International Group, Metropolitan Life and Prudential, three of America's largest insurance companies, might be among the biggest targets for banks, Mr. Ely and other analysts said.
Or, they might look for banks to acquire themselves.
What seems certain is that the splendid isolation that insurance companies have enjoyed even more than banks and securities companies is nearing an end.
One model for the future is AXA Financial, known until recently as the Equitable Companies.
The company includes Equitable, one of the largest life insurers and sellers of annuities, and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, an investment banking firm.

Though insurers have been barred from banking, many have begun encroaching on that industry by purchasing savings and loans that they hope to convert to commercial banks, said Allen R. Freedman, chairman and chief executive of Fortis Inc., a midsize life and health insurer.
Fortis is the American unit of the Fortis Group, the big Dutch and Belgian financial services company.
''This legislation confirms the market reality,'' he said.
''A lot of little bits and pieces are being filled in.''
One big piece is Citigroup, a company that has symbolized the imminent decline of Glass-Steagall even before the demise was assured.

As it is, Citigroup provides a glimpse of the kind of cross-selling financial companies say is possible when the old walls are torn down.
For example, brokers working for Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney have sold $420 million in Citibank mortgages to their clients in recent months, the company says.
It has also begun pilot programs in 29 states in which property and casualty insurance are sold to Citibank credit card customers.
''By liberating our financial companies from an antiquated regulatory structure, this legislation will unleash the creativity of our industry and insure our global competitiveness,'' Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, Citigroup's co-chairmen and co-chief executives, said in a statement yesterday.
''As a result, all Americans -- investors, savers, insureds -- will be better served,''

The new legislation eliminates what some executives viewed as a playing field tilted in favor of traditional commercial banks.
Under administrative changes in recent years, commercial banks like Chase Manhattan and Bank of America have been able to purchase securities firms.
But until now, the securities firms have not had the reciprocal right to buy commercial banks, which have been protected because they hold Government-guaranteed deposits.
Some Wall Street firms covet trust and custody businesses, a commercial banking preserve.
They see those businesses as fitting together well with their existing asset management and brokerage businesses because they house the wealth of affluent individuals.
''There are elements of the commercial banking business that are attractive to us,'' Mr. Komansky of Merrill Lynch said.
''For example, we have our own trust business.
This would enable us to accelerate growth if we choose to acquire a trust business.
The global custody business is another niche that we could be interested in.''
Northern Trust, U.S. Trust, State Street Bank and other commercial banks with large trust and custody services are among those that might be attractive to investment banks, several analysts said.
Mr. Komansky did not specify companies that Merrill would consider acquiring.
For consumers, one benefit might be that when financial companies rush to sell one another's products, prices tend to fall, even collapse.
Take stock trading.
Some Internet brokerage firms now eagerly offer the service for one-fifteenth the price traditional vendors typically charged just two years ago.
Today, some banks and brokerage firms offer free checking in accounts that pay money-market interest rates.

But consumer groups see a downside.
Now, with cross-selling and mergers expected to produce more unified providers, the concern is that companies will mine data to blitz consumers with marketing.
Or, if a bank discovers that a customer has a deadly disease, it might use that information to keep the person from taking out a 30-year mortgage.
Senator Phil Gramm, a prime proponent of the repeal of Glass-Steagall, and the American Banking Association contend that the financial overhaul offers consumers more privacy protections than current law.
Under the bill, financial institutions would be required in most circumstances to notify their customers if they sell personal information to third parties.
Customers then would have the right to demand that their private data be deleted from those files.
But customers would have no say in how private data are shared between the affiliated companies of the financial conglomerates that are expected to be created.
Uncertainty about privacy shows how the end of the Glass-Steagall era throws the financial industry into uncharted waters.
''The theories of what might happen remain to be tested,'' said Mr. Ely, the banking industry consultant.
''Either by the market, or in court.''

Antigua

Once a hangout for Horatio Nelson and the British Navy, Antigua is still a haven for sailors, who like the trade winds and splendid English Harbour.
Yachts race here year-round but especially during the annual Sailing Week, April 30 to May 6 in 2000, with a gathering of boats from around the world, preceded by a yacht regatta, April 20 to 25.
There is a Web site, www.sailingweek.com, with links to more information.
Today the dockyard's old Georgian buildings have been restored, and Nicholson has around 50 yachts for charter based in English Harbour and another 350 or so around the Caribbean: classic wooden boats, modern fiberglass vessels, high performance boats and mul tihulls.
The company specializes in crewed yachts accommodating from 2 to 14 pas sengers.

Bahamas

In the Bahamas, flashy hotels claim center stage, but there are also eco-lodges, blue-hole diving, snorkeling and beautiful beaches.
There are 700 islands, some 2,400 cays, and every kind of water sport.
Grand Bahama is home to the Underwater Explorers Society, (800) 992-3483, offering scuba lessons and a variety of expeditions, with boats leaving from the docks at Port Lucaya.
The price is $169 for a reef dive and a dive with dolphins, $82 for a shark dive, $60 for a wreck dive, $49 for a night dive and $145 for an all-day dive.

The week's price for two people is $3,700 from Jan. 3 to Feb. 28 and $3,200 from March 1 to April 11, including a room in an ocean-view cottage with king bed and private terrace, meals, fresh fruit and flowers in your room daily, and airport transfers.
Tortola

Yachts ply the clear blue waters, stopping to allow passengers to swim off secluded beaches, snorkel over a reef or disembark at a lively bar.
With countless coves and bays in the British Virgin Islands, sailors are rarely far from anchorages.
On the island of Tortola, the largest in the group, Road Town is among the convenient places to charter a yacht, crewed or bareboat.
The Moorings, (800) 368-9991, began operations there 30 years ago and now offers 770 yachts for charter around the world.
The Moorings' winter price for four people cruising a week on a crewed 50-foot sloop is $9,100.
The cost covers meals (except for two dinners ashore), drinks, housekeeping, the use of snorkeling equipment, inflatable dinghies with motors and airport transfers.
Trinidad and Tobago

The common thread is color: flash and dash among the islands' many-splendored species of birds, flowers, butterflies and the fetes that overtake the capital, Port-of-Spain, during the Caribbean's liveliest pre-Lenten season.
The fun begins in January with calypso performances and rolls to a crest on Carnival, celebrated the two days before Ash Wednesday -- March 8 next year -- in a frenzy of street parties, parades and bands.
For nature lovers, Trinidad's ground zero is the Asa Wright Nature Center and Lodge, a Victorian plantation house 1,200 feet up in the Northern Range, with hiking trails.
The veranda of the main lodge is a lookout for hummingbirds and toucans.
The Nature Center, (868) 667-4655, fax (868) 667-4540, off the Blanchisseuse Road, seven miles north of Arima, is open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.
Entry costs $6.
The lodge has 24 rooms for rent, $240 nightly for two, including meals, afternoon tea, service and tax.

Built along comely Batteaux Bay on Tobago at Speyside, the 38-room Blue Waters Inn, (800) 742-4276 or (868) 660-4341, fax (868) 660-5195, is a quiet spot for bird watchers, divers, snorkelers and beach fans.
Virgin Gorda

It's easy to love this island, home of a few secluded resorts, casual but drenched in civility, with hypnotic vistas.
Reachable only by sea, Biras Creek Resort, (800) 608-9661 or (284) 494-3555, fax (284) 494-3557, sits on 140 acres on a remote isthmus above three bays in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean and the North Sound.
There are hiking paths with scenic views, a bird sanctuary, a saltwater lake and attractive oceanfront suites with verandas and bicycles.
The setting for dinner is romantic, on a hill overlooking the water.
The resort has 23 suites in cottages along the Atlantic shore and 9 suites in the gardens.
Rates start at $650 and include meals and airport transfers as well as the use of Sunfish and other small boats, snorkeling gear and trips, two floodlighted tennis courts and snooker.
Biras Creek's new ferry picks up guests at the Tortola airport.
Pat Buchanan is expected to bolt the Republican Party today to run for the Reform Party nomination, and Donald Trump said yesterday he too is joining the Reform Party in advance of a possible Presidential bid.
But there is likely to be little celebration inside the Reform ranks, because while both men may generate a lot of national attention, they are unlikely to improve the party's diminishing prospects.
There are, of course, many reasons why the Reform Party has lost its bearings.
Ross Perot's desire to control its every aspect has discouraged many serious candidates from running.
Jesse Ventura, the wrestler turned governor, can talk himself into any amount of trouble.
Social issues like abortion continue to divide the party.
But there is another important reason the Reform Party has become the butt of so many late-night jokemeisters: the strong economy.
Contrary to what many pundits have said, the Reform Party does have an agenda -- it supports fiscal conservatism and trade protectionism.
That's not at all far afield from Mr. Buchanan's fiscal philosophy, nor does it seem to clash with what little we know of Mr. Trump's beliefs.
But if economic synergy has made a match of either Mr. Trump or Mr. Buchanan and the Reform Party, it may also keep the party from duplicating the success of Ross Perot in the 1992 Presidential election, when he won almost 20 percent of the vote.

He won largely by capitalizing on discontent about the economy.
(Likewise, Mr. Trump is now warning of a possible recession, hoping that such uncertainty might play to his strength as a savvy businessman.)
Today, the sky-high stock market, low unemployment and cheap interest rates have all taken the steam out of the party's issues.
With the Dow Jones at 10,000, it will take more than the North American Free Trade Agreement to get the average voter fired up.
What would benefit the Reform Party -- short of a well-defined platform that addresses important issues like health care reform and Social Security -- is a recession, complete with spiraling inflation and rising unemployment.
That might make voters wish for a pox on the houses of both the Republicans and Democrats and start looking in earnest for alternatives.
But the question is, would the Reform Party then turn to Donald Trump or Pat Buchanan?
A recession might make the Reform Party seem more attractive to substantive candidates, like Lowell Weicker or Colin Powell, who have broader appeal and more credibility.
That's not enough anymore.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Buchanan won't help the Reform Party unless they change their messages to suit the times and stop overplaying dire economic warnings.
If they don't, it may cost both of them -- and the party itself -- whatever credibility they may have.
''Barring some big outside event, I think the market will stay in a trading range for the remainder of the year.
But one more interest rate increase before year-end could be a negative.''
Worries about higher interest rates, which could put a crimp in future earnings, helped to drag down the Dow Jones industrial average.
Despite good earnings reports from a number of companies that are included in the Dow, the blue-chip index fell 120.32, or 1.15 percent, to 10,349.93.
The Nasdaq composite index barely budged, dropping 0.57, to 2,815.95.
Yet the advance/decline figures for the week showed more declining issues than advancing ones on all three exchanges.
It's the same old story: the big stocks rally and the rest of the market languishes.''

''A ruling should have been made right there,'' Holyfield said yesterday.
They should have made him get up and fight, or they should have disqualified Tyson.
They shouldn't leave boxing in limbo.''
The commission has withheld Tyson's $10 million purse.
Holyfield said the commission should have reined in Tyson a long time ago and the referees should do a better job of enforcing the rules about hitting on the break and after the bell.

''You know it's not an accident, because it's been happening his whole career,'' Holyfield said.
He's been cracking people for a long time.
People are fed up with Tyson and more people are saying things about it now.
''It should have been stopped a long time ago.''
Holyfield said that hitting after the bell is just one of the tricks that boxers, and particularly Tyson, have used to try to intimidate opponents in the ring.
''This means a lot to a fighter,'' Holyfield said.
''When someone hits me on the break, I usually hit him back, because the person who gets hit last when they sit on the stool, they've got more to think about.
Riddick Bowe, in that second fight, he kept hitting me on the break.
''Tyson had a habit of hitting on the break, because he tries to steal people's hearts.
I made up my mind that there wasn't going to be no hitting on the break.''

He said his training has gone well and he has changed his schedule so he trains at night.
''I'm a night owl again,'' Holyfield said.

But the index, which rose 107.33 points yesterday, or 1 percent, to 10,729.86, has posted 7 hefty advances in the last 10 sessions as investors and traders acted on a round of generally buoyant profit reports, Government statistics suggesting that inflation remained subdued and a growing belief that Mr. Greenspan would decide that only one more increase in short-term rates would be needed.
A poll by Reuters yesterday found 18 economists expecting a quarter-point increase and 12 predicting that the central bank would leave rates alone.
Other positive developments have been the agreement in Washington to lift Depression-era barriers on the banking, securities and insurance industries, and the drying-up of tax-motivated selling by mutual funds as they approached the end of their bookkeeping year.
''We're seeing a number of things that undercut or at least mitigate the inflation fears,'' said Clare W. Zempel, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, citing among other things the Government report on Thursday showing that upward pressure on wages and benefits was lower than expected over the summer.

For Kelly, it is the skeptical and ironic Herzen who points in the proper direction.
Influenced by the empiricism of Bacon and the ''aestheticism'' of Schiller, he posited a hard moral autonomy free of all formal principles and predetermined systems, even the liberal's consoling notion of progress.
Herzen, in Kelly's formulation, believed that individuals should be governed ''not by adherence to fixed and universal precepts, but by freely adjusting the relations between their sensual and rational drives in order to respond sensitively and appropriately to the demands of specific situations.''
They can peer into Nietzsche's abyss and laugh, joyfully accepting the risks and requirements of contingency.

Deftly examining Herzen's views from a variety of perspectives, Kelly argues that he is vastly underappreciated in the West, and she is surely correct.
(Just try to find any of his books at your local bookstore.)
But he is also largely ignored in Russia -- in part because he was a favorite of Lenin's -- and for Kelly that is a disaster.
She frames her book with an introduction and conclusion that speak to the intellectual situation in present-day Russia.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The ''messianic component'' in Russian thinking that produced Bolshevism on the left and pan-Slavism on the right, that preached a nationalist unity with no room for dissent, that fed both authoritarianism and totalitarianism, is alive and well, Kelly says.
Westernizers within Russia and their friends in other countries may hope for the emergence of a liberal democracy out of the rubble of Communism, but there is a strong pull in another, more familiar direction, toward what she calls the ''Russian Idea.''
It is nativist, xenophobic and backward-looking, and it can draw on a centuries-old tradition, one that ''knew nothing of the Renaissance, the Reformation and the first flowering of secular thought in the West.''
Kelly reports that ''the militant and isolationist nationalism that had existed as a strong though muted strand of Soviet intellectual life'' is now being openly ''expressed in a gamut of monthly journals, newspapers and pamphlets ranging from respectable organs which carried the debates of academic philosophers and literary critics to vehicles for vicious anti-Semitic ravings.''
Alliances are being established ''between neo-Stalinist Communists and religious conservatives, crude xenophobes and sophisticated neonationalists, on the basis of a shared devotion to the Russian Idea.''
Despite occasional carping about ''triumphalism,'' few in Western Europe and the United States doubt the desirability of remaking the former Soviet Union in a Western image.
If we could snap our fingers and magically transform Russia into a country with a respected constitution of checks and balances, a stabilized and noncorrupt free market, a widespread regard for individual rights and an internalized ethos of tolerance and diversity, everyone -- in the East and the West -- would be better off.
But the problem is how to get there from here.
In the absence of war, democratic principles and institutions can't be imposed from outside or above, and it is unlikely that Ivan and Ivana are voluntarily going to start looking for answers in the writings of John Locke, Thomas Jefferson and Martin Luther King Jr.
This small collection of essays is, among other things, an argument that an indigenous and honorable ''minority countertradition'' exists to set against the ominous Russian Idea.
That countertradition can be found in Chekhov's clear-eyed integrity, in Bakhtin's pluralism and multiperspectivism and, most important, in Herzen's concept of moral autonomy.
Russia can indeed become a part of the West, Kelly insists, but it will have to do so on its own terms.
''Views From the Other Shore'' is her contribution to finding those terms, reintroducing Russians to the best in their own cultural heritage and helping them in the dicey project of constructing a usable past.
Americans are unaware that Congress and the president have just agreed to put us all at extraordinary financial and personal risk.
Senate Banking Chairman Phil Gramm has struck a deal with Clinton Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to knock down all fire walls between banks, insurance companies and brokerage houses.
Global financiers are given the green light for ever-greater concentrations of power.
But today's lust for global giantism has swept aside the voices of prudence; generous financial lobbies have persuaded our leaders that in enormous size there is strength.
Not everyone has forgotten the adage of ''the bigger they come, the harder they fall.''
In a little-noticed speech to bankers about the need for oversight of the growing ''appetite for risk,'' Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said that megabanks are becoming ''complex entities that create the potential for unusually large systemic risks in the national and international economy should they fail.''
Fail?
That's a word that has been all but stricken from mergermania's vocabulary.
It can only be used in the phrase ''too big to fail'' -- where the American taxpayer would have to bail out a failing multitentacled financial network lest it sink the whole jerry-built global edifice.
A few of us have no appetite for assuming that risk -- which would be 10 times as costly as the 80's S.&L.

Here's the catch: What happens when those ''outside companies'' are not outside at all -- but are part of one great big family of broker-banking-insurance services?
Then, without your consent, the private information you write on your mortgage application, with your tax return attached, goes to your insurance company, which already has your health history -- and its snoops can also see your investment behavior and what you've been buying with your credit cards.
Under Gramm-Summers, giant financial conglomerates -- using other surveillance to protect against fraud -- will know more about your money habits, your assets, your diseases and your genetic makeup than your spouse or paramour does, and probably more than you do.
And just as he has done with his health-privacy ''protection,'' Mr. Clinton will sign the bipartisan legislation, leaving you naked to any prying eyes with an Orwellian statement about how this protects your privacy.
Listen for the word consent.
Listen for the word permission.
You won't hear them, because that puts the expensive obligation on the marketers and snoops to seek your consent and alert you to their intrusion.
Instead, you will hear malarkey about how you will have control.
That code word means that you must search for invasions of your privacy from punch-this-number telephone-answering computers and impenetrable bureaucracies.
Some ''control.''
Sheer size rules.
We look to government either to regulate monopoly or enforce competition.
But as we have deregulated to let the free market operate, government has failed to enforce antitrust laws to maintain competition in media and now in money.
Today's result: mergermania, dangerous concentration of financial risk, and the even greater risk to that part of our freedom we call privacy.
Mr. Donohue dispatched a flurry of letters urging New York City Council members to cut off public funding.

''We're like the Marines who go in and clear the forest,'' Mr. Donohue said as he plunged a fork into the macaroni salad that he had for lunch on Thursday in his rented office in the Archdiocese headquarters on First Avenue and East 55th Street.
He was eating at his desk, alone as usual.
''The church has something to say,'' he said.
''People can agree or disagree, but I would hope when they disagree, they can do it respectfully.
There's a cacophony of catcalls stopping that message from getting out at the moment and what I want to do is give it a fair hearing -- and then walk away.''
But others say the Catholic League -- whose symbol is a shield and sword -- only worsens the din.
The Rev.
James Martin, a Jesuit priest and associate editor of America, a national Catholic magazine, said he disagrees as often as he agrees with the Catholic League.
''Often their criticism is right on target, but frequently they speak without seeing or experiencing what they are critiquing, and that undercuts their credibility,'' he said.
''Unfortunately, that type of response gives people the idea that the Catholic Church is unreflective.''
Although he supports the church's teachings on life-and-death issues like abortion and the death penalty, he steers clear of divisive debates on theological doctrines and secular politics.

''We're not at all like the Christian Coalition, which, let's face it, is the Christian arm of the Republican Party,'' said Mr. Donohue, who is an independent voter.
''I don't care about the Republicans, and I don't care about the Democrats.''
Today, the Catholic League has grown to an estimated 350,000 members (Mr. Donohue multiplies the number of households that donate money by 1.5 to include spouses and other family members).
But he counts no Hyannisport Kennedys among them.
Instead, Mr. Donohue's support comes from rank-and-file Catholics like Jodie Thompson, a real estate developer in Dallas, who has given $50,000 in the last two years, making him the league's biggest donor.
''I think a lot of Catholics are fed up with attacks on Catholicism and Christianity, too,'' Mr. Thompson said.
''There aren't attacks on Jews, Buddhists or Hindus.
If someone attacks other faiths, they would be severely criticized.''
Mr. Donohue fans this simmering anger with inflammatory news releases, a Web site and newsletter, The Catalyst, that condemn everything from Miramax movies to tasteless jokes about nuns.
Every other month, he requests donations for a large ad or some other project.
He writes personal notes to those who give more than $250.

The Catholic League receives no money from the church, but it maintains close ties to the leadership.
Several bishops make personal donations.
But Mr. Donohue denies that he does Cardinal O'Connor's bidding.
''We are not a front group for the cardinal.
Nobody calls the shots here.''
No one, that is, but Mr. Donohue.
He leads the crusade against anti-Catholicism from his tidy corner office lined with religious awards and pictures of Christ, the Virgin Mary and various saints.
Unexpectedly, there is also a silver-framed photo of Mr. Donohue with Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, at a recent news conference.
''People are surprised that Norm and I are friends,'' he said.
''You know why I like him?
Because he's a straight shooter.''
For his part, Mr. Siegel said he has come to respect Mr. Donohue's aggressive leadership of the Catholic League -- and to view him as a formidable opponent.
He described Mr. Donohue as a ''populist'' who frequently takes extreme ''Bunker-type positions'' to appeal to religious conservatives.
''He's a bright, well-read individual, but he wants to be a kind of intellectual Archie Bunker,'' Mr. Siegel said.
Mr. Donohue concedes that his tactics can be, well, uncharitable, but he points to the results.
When he calls for a protest or boycott, he commands attention.
''I'm saying I want results and fast results.''

Thankfully for Casey, the circumstances improved.
With Stephon Marbury scoring as if playing in a schoolyard and Feick grabbing rebounds like a child reaching into a bag of Halloween candy, the Nets pulled within 2 points in the final minute before finally losing by 119-112.
That's a veteran team that stays poised to the end, but we played good basketball and got back in the game.''
With Keith Van Horn struggling on 5-for-19 shooting (16 points) and no other Nets player scoring more than 13, Marbury took it upon himself to get his team rolling.
He ended up attempting a career-high 34 shots, making 15, in scoring 30 or more points for the fifth straight regular-season game, dating from last season.
We fed off him and soon everyone was playing hard and we were coming back.''
After averaging 12.8 rebounds in the preseason, Feick was looking forward to starting on the opening night of the season.
But Casey thought the 7-1 McIlvaine would matchup better with Rik Smits, the Pacers' 7-4 center.

He was unable to speak after the game because of the severe swelling of his nose and is questionable for Wednesday's game.
Coincidentally, the injured Jayson Williams, whose production and style of play is all but mirrored by Feick, broke his nose in the first game of last season, courtesy of a Dikembe Mutombo elbow.
With 41.6 seconds remaining tonight, Marbury and Feick hooked up beautifully, each doing what he does best, to cut Indiana's lead to 112-110.
With the delays and referee's whistles, the teams toiled for 2 hours and 53 minutes.
The officials, adhering to the league's new no-touch defensive rules, called 77 fouls as the teams combined to shoot 99 free throws.
Four players fouled out, including Van Horn, Scott Burrell and Kendall Gill for the Nets.
''The first few games of the seasons the referees will call a lot of fouls, and after 10 games or so they'll stop calling the fouls.''
''As we get people back, the problem is going to become exacerbated,'' Nash said before the game.
''When Kerry Kittles gets healthy, that's going to put intense pressure on Coach Casey to either start Kerry or perhaps consider moving Kendall Gill to small forward, which puts pressure on Scott Burrell.''

This tended to support the view that the Federal Reserve, which has a policy meeting set for Nov. 16, will need to make no more than one more monetary tightening and could avoid making any.
On the other hand, said David G. Sowerby, a market strategist at Loomis Sayles in Detroit, ''stocks could weaken'' if the Labor Department reports strong job growth or a further decline in the 4.2 percent unemployment rate, matching the lowest in a generation, on Friday.
Be Free, a Massachusetts company that provides Internet marketing services for online merchants, offered 5.6 million shares at 12.
Tobacco stocks benefited from a signal that Florida's highest court might head off a huge damage award in a class-action suit by smokers against the industry.
The Russell 2,000 is up 3.91 percent so far this year.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange remained heavy, expanding to 914.4 million from 904.6 million on Tuesday.
The Nasdaq composite finished with its sixth straight gain, advancing 27.44 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent.
At 3,055.95, the index is up 9 percent in the last week and 39 percent so far this year.
The jobs number is one of the most closely watched indicators of the economy and a rise of more than an expected 300,000 or so would revive fears in the stock market that the Federal Reserve will raise its interest rate target when it meets on Nov. 16.
That prospect has receded substantially of late but could return, said Mr. Herrmann, himself skeptical of scattered evidence that the economy is slowing down on its own.

Many financial stocks, which are widely but perhaps erroneously regarded as vulnerable to rising rates, posted big gains yesterday, with J. P. Morgan up 4 3/8, to 133 1/2, to account for more than two-thirds of the rise in the Dow blue chips.

Of the index components, winners outnumbered losers 248 to 229, evidence of the improved market breadth that has emerged lately.
Another plus was the projection by Abby Joseph Cohen, the venerable Goldman, Sachs strategist, that the profits of S.& P. companies would grow another 8 percent next year.
Alan Hoffman, senior portfolio manager at Value Line Asset Management, also expressed optimism about the market outlook while warning that year-end computer problems could prove disruptive, especially the impact of foreign failures on multinational companies.
A 20-mile road that skirts the Mediterranean has been widened, horn-honking forbidden and dilapidated buildings torn down, all to open a fresh window to a sea that has always fed Alexandria's cosmopolitan spirit.
And just offshore, underwater beneath the city's historic harbor, archaeologists from France and Egypt are uncovering remnants of much that disappeared long ago, having toppled into the sea.

If the claims are accurate, they include remnants from Cleopatra's palace, and from the fabled lighthouse that was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
There is talk of one day transforming the waters into an underwater park.
The highly popular governor, Muhammad Abdel Salam al-Mahgoud, has taken a big step in that direction by halting sewage flow that rendered the waters of the city's harbor a kind of translucent muck.
Still, Alexandria today is burdened with four million people, all packed into an overcrowded coastal strip.
Outside the museums a visitor sees few signs of the city's ancient harbor, and even the faded charm that made Alexandria a haven for foreign writers after World War II now seems encrusted in dirt.
Alexandria is Africa's third-largest city, behind Cairo and Lagos, Nigeria.
But except in the notable case of the Egyptians who flock to its shores in the summer, it is often bypassed.
That might change, some say, with the opening of the modernistic $185 million library, designed by a Norwegian firm that won an international competition and built to emulate the rising sun and the perpetual dawning of knowledge.
With space for four million works, a French-designed computerized catalog and 500 built-in Internet ports, the library, which is to be open to researchers from around the world as well as the public, will immediately become by far the largest and most advanced in the Arab world.
More than half of the construction cost has been paid by the Egyptian Government, which has made the project a national priority.

Without that help, said Muhammad Kamel Ibrahim, an economist at the Alexandria Business Association, the dream of reviving a symbol so important to Alexandria would never have been possible.
The old library had the muscle of an empire behind it, having been conceived in 306 B.C.

By contrast, the cash-starved Egyptian government has set the new library's acquisitions budget at just $5 million a year, so for its resources the institution will have to rely heavily on the generosity of others.
For now its collection stands at just 350,000 works, a tiny fraction of capacity, and just one-fourth the size of Egypt's 1.5 million-volume national library in Cairo.
Most of the works collected are from the humanities and social sciences, and huge gaps remain in the arts and architecture, business management, science and technology.
''I am sure that more support will come after the inauguration,'' Dr. Zahran, the project director, said.
But though the library was scheduled to open last spring, workers have only now begun the finishing touches, including a granite exterior etched with characters from a hodgepodge of languages.
Still, a planetarium and a conference center adjoining the library have been completed.
But at least part of that collection is now believed to have survived that conflagration, only to disappear in the face of further traumas.
The library may finally have been wiped out in the third century A.D., some historians say, during fighting under Emperor Aurelian.
But others say some scrolls probably endured until the fourth century or even the seventh century, only to be burned in the heat of anti-pagan or anti-Christian strife.
This time, builders have taken no chances.
Below the ground, the foundation is encased in a cylindrical shell as protection from the sea and earthquakes.
And yes, the library does include fire escapes.
TECHNOLOGY has been the undisputed champ of the bull market.
But investors seeking a slightly less risky way to jump into the sector may want to consider convertible bonds.
Technology companies have long tapped investor enthusiasm by issuing convertibles and preferred stock to finance the next stage of their growth.
Of the $26 billion of convertibles issued year to date, more than 30 percent were from technology companies, according to the Value Line Convertible Survey.
Technology convertibles make up 41 percent of the market value of the Merrill Lynch All U.S. Convertibles Index, versus 26 percent one year ago.
(Even a relatively technology-heavy index like the Standard & Poor's 500 has a technology weighting of just 24 percent.)
The Merrill index has returned 17.8 percent so far this year, nearly keeping pace with the 19.0 percent return of the underlying stocks, according to Preston Harrington III, a convertible bond strategist at Merrill Lynch.
Mr. Harrington says technology convertibles may be an attractive alternative for investors who worry about the high valuations of the sector's stocks.
Convertibles are hybrid securities that can be exchanged for a specific number of shares in the issuer's underlying common stock.
They offer much of the upside of a stock if prices are rising -- investors can sell the appreciated bond or convert it to stock.
At the same time, the fixed interest rate paid on them provides some of the protection of a bond.

The hook for investors is that a fairly priced convertible usually rises more on an increase in the price of the underlying stock than it falls if the shares tumble.
''There is no question investors can sometimes do better with a tech convert'' than with the common stock of the same issuer, said Michael Shamosh, bond strategist at Tucker Anthony.
But, he added, there is still plenty of risk.

Hedge funds, for example, often profit by selling short the shares of technology companies, betting that they will decline, while holding the convertibles, so they can profit from a steeper decline in the stock while collecting the convertible's yield.
That creates volatility when the hedge funds unwind the positions.
On their own, however, individual investors face big hurdles in buying convertibles, which are often rated below investment grade.
Experts say sophisticated skills are needed to analyze the complex risks of both the stock and the bond.
And because most of the technology convertibles are issued on an unregistered basis, only institutions can buy them initially.
Individuals cannot trade the bonds until they are registered, usually 90 to 180 days later.
Convertible funds offer one solution.
These have returned 12.6 percent a year to date through October, versus 10.2 percent for the average United States diversified fund, according to Lipper Inc., the research firm.
The $70 million Value Line Convertible fund had a 40 percent technology weighting, which includes the bonds of Internet companies like Doubleclick, Mindspring Enterprises and CNET.
It has an average credit quality of BB.
The $47.4 million TCW Galileo Convertible Securities fund, with 37 percent of its assets in technology, has stakes in STMicroelectronics, Intel and Conexant Systems, and has an average credit quality of BBB-, higher than the average convertible fund.
The $449 million Van Kampen Harbor fund, with 36 percent of its holdings in technology, holds big positions in Comverse Technology and Conextant.
Its average credit rating is BB+.
I have since learned that it is reasonably safe for pregnant women to take a number of drugs in common use, though they should consult their doctors before taking any drug.
Even some vaccines, including the flu vaccine, are safe to administer to pregnant women.
Furthermore, most medications pose no hazard to a nursing infant because the amount that gets into breast milk is usually too small to have a noticeable effect on the baby.

What's Safe?
Let's start with a general recommendation from Dr. Jennifer R. Niebyl, head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine, who says, ''Pregnant women should be discouraged from using over-the-counter drugs for trivial indications.''
Thus, a common cold is best treated with rest, fluids, a humidifier and, if needed, a saltwater (saline) nasal spray like Ocean.
Topical medications, like a decongestant nasal spray, are safer than oral ones, and if any cold remedy is used, combination drugs are best avoided.
Cough remedies containing iodide should be avoided because they may cause a large goiter in an unborn child.
For aches and pains, try local applications of heat and rest.
But if, say, you have a headache you can't shake and it's interfering with your life, acetaminophen (like Tylenol) is safer than aspirin near the end of pregnancy because it does not prolong bleeding and is not toxic to newborns.
To reduce the risk of vaginal yeast infections, a common problem among pregnant women, antibiotics should be used only when needed to control a known bacterial infection.
Safe antibiotics include penicillin and its derivatives, erythromycin and the cephalosporins.
On the other hand, sulfonamides are best avoided in the third trimester, and tetracyclines, which cause discoloration of babies' teeth, should not be used beyond 25 weeks of gestation.
The drug metronidazole, commonly used to treat intestinal parasites, is best avoided in the first trimester.
Lindane (as in Kwell), formerly widely used to treat lice infestations, should be avoided entirely during pregnancy, and pregnant women should wear rubber gloves when treating children for head lice; safer alternatives are the pyrethroids with piperonyl butoxide (Rid and R&C, for example) or a fine-toothed comb.

The new nonsedating antihistamines used to treat allergies have not been tested for safety in pregnancy.
But women who have been receiving desensitization shots can continue to do so at a maintenance dose during pregnancy.
Women with asthma can safely use theophylline, aminophylline, terbutaline and cromolyn sodium.
And it may surprise you to learn that the potent immune-suppressing drugs prednisone and prednisolone are considered drugs of choice during pregnancy because they are nearly completely inactivated by the placenta.
Also safe are alphamethyldopa and propranolol to treat chronic hypertension.
For women plagued by heartburn, antacids are safe for use in any trimester, but bicarbonate of soda, magnesium trisilicate and the new H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are potentially toxic to the fetus.
Reports on the safety of the new antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (S.S.R.I.
's) have been mixed.
's or tricyclic antidepressant drugs taken in recommended doses during pregnancy.
Although most medications taken in normal doses by a nursing mother are safe for infants, a few are definitely too toxic for a baby.
These include chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer; lithium to treat bipolar disorder and drugs like cyclosporine that suppress the immune system.
Even when taking a safe drug, a nursing mother would be wise to coordinate the dosages with the baby's schedule, just after the baby has been fed or before the baby's longest sleep.

For more information about the safety of over-the-counter drugs during pregnancy, see ''I'm Pregnant and I Have a Cold'' by Dr. Craig V. Towers, a perinatologist in California at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, just published by RBC Press ($27.95 in hardcover, $14.95 in paperback).
She approves of the toxoid and inactivated vaccines -- tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines -- although she advises that even these vaccines are best given in the second and third trimesters in case they may have some effect yet unrecognized on a young fetus.
Flu vaccine (taken each fall to include the latest strains) is now recommended for all pregnant women.
To be avoided are live virus and bacterial vaccines, including those for measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox.
Legal recreational drugs like alcohol, nicotine and caffeine are also common concerns among pregnant women.
Cigarette smoking during pregnancy can compromise fetal growth, resulting in babies that are smaller than they should be at birth, and may also cause long-lasting intellectual deficits.
Heavy consumption of alcohol during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome marked by subnormal growth, muscle and heart damage, and low intelligence or mental retardation.
Although an occasional drink is highly unlikely to have any adverse effect on a developing fetus, the Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women to refrain from drinking any alcohol.
Caffeine and coffee, on the other hand, have been pretty much cleared of earlier suspicions of fetal harm, at least when consumed in moderation: no more than three cups of coffee a day.
In 1980, after reports of birth defects in mice induced by caffeine, the F.D.A.
warned pregnant women to limit their intake of coffee.
But considerable evidence accumulated since has not implicated coffee as a cause of birth defects in humans.
Still, there is some evidence that consuming more than three cups of coffee a day may slightly reduce birth weights.

In the not-so-old days, a restaurateur knew he had a reviewer in the house when he spotted a group of suspiciously ravenous customers playing musical plates.
Now, everyone's a food snob, and every table is a virtual lazy susan.
No one's meal is safe.
Many restaurants have started pushing ''family style'' dining on larger parties.
Suddenly, it's Chinatown all over town.
Tim Zagat, of the restaurant guidebooks, has just the utensil to help satisfy all these hungry eyes.
It's his special ''tasting fork.''
No ordinary cutlery item, the fork has a telescoping handle that increases the user's reach by a full three feet.
''If you handle it right, it's very funny,'' he said, adding that the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, requested 100 extendo-forks after Mr. Zagat's wife, Nina, whipped hers out during a recent Relais & Chateaux conference in Bordeaux.
''The French fall off their seats.''
Maybe because, in France, forking into someone else's chateaubriand is still considered gauche.
Americans now seem to feel no such horreur.
''When I first started seeing it, I was, like, 'Can we do that?
Is it O.K.?'
Then you realize there's almost no ceiling.
People who do it do it in four-star places.''
His parents, who live in Miami, still don't buy it, Mr. Friedman said.
''They say: 'This what they're teaching you in New York?
Is this what those chefs teach you?'
''

Why not just put all your elbows on the table, too?
But that rule has gone away with all the others, laments Letitia Baldrige, the etiquette expert.
Sharing food is a pet peeve of hers.

''You're passing food around and dropping it.
It's exceedingly unappetizing.''

Strange that in today's hyper-hygienic culture, food sharers think nothing of engaging in the equivalent of what ''Seinfeld'' memorably identified as ''double dipping'' -- taking a bite out of a chip, or whatever, at a party, then sticking it back into the dip, germs and all.
The whole business still makes Andrew Davidson, a computer consultant, a little squeamish.
''It's that kid thing where once it's shared, it feels broken,'' he said.
''You don't want it.''
Mr. Davidson's wife is a food writer, so he's been on his share of restaurant outings.
But he's never quite gotten used to the group-grope approach to eating.
''The more expensive the restaurant, the smaller the portions,'' he said, and ''the more of a drag it is to share your food.''
You order something specific, and you've got your mind set on it, he said.
''The worst is when people offer you something when what they're really trying to do is get a bite of what you're eating,'' he added.
For New Yorkers, dining out is yet another arena for competition.
Whoever dies with the most entrees under his belt, wins.
''If people try six different things, it's a feeling of accomplishment.''
Some restaurateurs are eager to oblige.
At Thalia, a month-old arrival in the theater district, the executive chef, Michael Otsuka, said his waiters are instructed that ''if people are sharing food, it's something we want to know about.''
If it's soup, ''we get a bunch of soup spoons over,'' he said.
For a sashimi dish served with bamboo chopsticks on the plate, ''we bring out extra pairs.''
Asian menus often encourage sharing, but Thalia takes it to a new level by offering diners eight-inch ''share plates.''
The Red Cat, a bistro on 10th Avenue at 24th Street, pushes family-style dining for reasons of convenience -- the restaurant's as much as the diner's.
It's hard to service a table with too much stuff on it.''
Sometimes, Mr. Bradley said, ''we just hand you a platter of food, and you pass it around.''
Even the top French restaurants have adjusted to this very American custom.
La Caravelle, on West 55th Street, now sends around an hors d'oeuvres cart that caters to the diners' desire to mix and match.
Rita Jammet, the restaurant's co-owner, agreed that in France sharing is frowned upon, but she contended that ''it adds congeniality'' to a meal.

''It's good for people who want to try several things without ordering a tasting menu,'' she said.
Though she acknowledged that when customers start mixing your sweetbreads with white truffle and parsnip emulsion with roasted sea scallops, ''you might not control the progression of tastes, because something strong first might make the second dish appear bland.''
Besides being a cheapskate's version of a tasting menu, sharing raises all kinds of political and psychological issues.
Only children are often reluctant sharers, though growing up with predatory siblings can have the same effect.
Mr. Friedman said he had noticed that ''with some couples, especially with a guy who is not quite minding his manners, if he's paying for the woman, he'll demand a bite of what she's having.''
Likewise with bosses and employees.
He who pays the piper gets a piece of your cote de veau.
For those who get a little ruffled in these situations or who feel the urge to exclaim ''Boundaries!''
when some fast-forked foodie reaches over and skewers another scallop, Mrs. Child can always be invoked.
''Announce it at the beginning of the meal,'' she counsels.
''Say, 'This time, let's not share.'

But the shrinking pool of available labor, and the possibility that upward pressure on wages could spur inflation, seem to be the biggest issues on the minds of Federal Reserve officials as they debate whether to raise interest rates a third time this year when they meet on Tuesday.

So far, employment cost increases have remained restrained despite the drop in unemployment.
Moreover, to the degree that those costs have surged, from such hot industries as computer software and telecommunications to more traditional sectors like retailing, businesses have proved remarkably successful in absorbing them without sacrificing profits or raising prices.
The reasons range from new trends in compensation, like the rising use of stock options in the place of salary increases, to an upturn in the growth rate of productivity, or each worker's output each hour.
The question is how long such forces can keep a lid on the pressures that might force up wages and prices.
Productivity improvements can continue, one Fed official said recently, ''but it defies all logic to assume you won't get increases in prices and wages at some point.''
Nobody knows precisely when that point will be reached, though, making the decision about whether to raise rates next week a particularly close call for the central bank, which pushed its benchmark Federal funds target rate up by a quarter of a percentage point in August, to 5.25 percent, after an earlier quarter-point increase in June.
There is clearly a case for the Fed to take no action next week.
By most measures, inflation remains reasonably well contained.
The economy is showing some signs of slowing in response to earlier interest rate increases.
Many stocks are down from their highs this summer.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other Fed officials are increasingly convinced that the improvement in productivity growth reflects structural changes in the way businesses operate, not just a brief cyclical upturn.
''If they do raise rates, I'd really like to know why,'' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. ''The only rationale is that growth is strong, and I think the Fed has moved beyond the idea that growth by itself is something to be afraid of.''
The case in favor of another rate increase next week is built largely on the idea that the nation is running out of workers, and that at some point a simple supply-and-demand situation will lead to a surge in wages and then, perhaps, prices.
In this view, the Fed should stay ahead of the trend by slowing the economy a bit more to keep the labor market from getting even tighter.
''Even in the absence of a rise in core inflation, developments in the labor market are likely to result in the Fed instituting more pre-emptive rate hikes,'' said Ian Morris, an economist at HSBC Securities in New York.

In a report last month, John Youngdahl, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, took an in-depth look at the strains in the labor market.
He said that even the broadest measure of available labor -- including not just people who are officially unemployed but some part-time workers and others who might be tempted back into the labor market -- had declined steeply, to 7 percent in September from 7.6 percent a year earlier.
Joblessness among adults, 3.5 percent in October, is near a three-decade low.
Overall labor force participation is stagnant or down, and the growth of the labor force is slowing somewhat.
Mr. Youngdahl concluded that there appeared to be growing sentiment at the Fed that it is ''not only the small size but the inflexibility of the margin in labor supply that creates potential for an appreciable upward shift in labor expense growth.''

In his public appearances, Mr. Greenspan has alluded repeatedly to tight labor markets.
Speaking to a group of business executives last month, Mr. Greenspan said that the number of people being drawn into the work force beyond those due to normal population trends -- in other words, people who had previously chosen not to work -- was accounting for roughly half a percentage point of economic growth.
Eventually, Mr. Greenspan said, the economy would have to revert back to a growth rate reflecting normal labor force growth and the long-term rate of productivity gains.
''Clearly, the growth in gross domestic product cannot exceed the sum of growth in structural productivity and in the working-age population indefinitely,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
''Market pressures must eventually emerge that work to contain such unsustainable growth.''
There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of mounting pressures in the labor markets.
Moreover, Johnson's customers in industries like automobiles demand decreasing prices on some of its products, putting additional pressure on the company to offset rising labor costs with productivity improvements.
And at the loftiest reaches of the employment scale, experienced executives going into senior jobs at technology start-ups are able to demand and get richer packages of stock and options in addition to cash compensation.

''We're living in the middle of an unprecedented supply-and-demand imbalance,'' said David B. Kixmiller, a partner in the Silicon Valley office of Heidrick & Struggles, the executive search firm.
To hold down labor costs in that kind of environment, companies have become more imaginative.
Some use one-time cash bonuses to reward workers without permanently raising wage rates.
Others are offering more equity-based pay programs like stock options that do not show up in traditional measures of wage and salary growth.
Others are offering expensive gifts, extra time off and other benefits in an effort to lure new employees and hold onto the ones they have.
Some analysts also think that workers themselves are less aggressive in pushing for pay increases than they were in previous business cycles when unemployment dipped to low levels.
The reason, they speculate, is that the combination of global competition and the relentless corporate push to cut costs hasleft workers somewhat insecure about their jobs -- even if they are relatively confident that they could find another if they did become unemployed.
The pressure on labor costs could well ease if the economy is indeed slowing.
But the economy has repeatedly defied projections of a slowdown, and at this point continued strong growth could send unemployment down to levels the nation has not seen since 1969.
Mr. Morris of HSBC calculated recently that if labor force growth remains at its current annual rate of roughly 1 percent, labor force participation remains steady at around 67 percent and the economy creates an average of 250,000 nonfarm jobs a month, the unemployment rate will decline to as low as 3.5 percent by the middle of next year.
If job growth averages 200,000 a month -- it has been running at an average of 192,000 a month this year -- it would push the unemployment rate down to as low as 3.9 percent by mid-2000, Mr. Morris said.
Fed officials will no doubt scrutinize new reports on retail sales and productivity that are to be released on Friday, the last major economic indicators before their meeting next Tuesday.
And while they have given few clues in the last few weeks as to their thinking about the arguments for and against a rate increase, they have made clear that they are very much on alert.
''One should not assume that the business cycle is dead,'' William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, told reporters in Vienna today after delivering a speech there.

The Nasdaq composite index closed at its 10th record high in the last 11 sessions, rising 23.86 points, or 0.75 of a percent, to 3,221.15.

One explanation for the quick reaction may have been that the tremors from this quake, unlike those from the one in August, were felt in Ankara, the capital.
People there rushed to donate blood and supplies, moving much more quickly than they had in August.
Heads of state and government from more than 50 countries, among them President Clinton, are scheduled to come to Istanbul next week for a summit meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

''Oh God, What Pain!''
To the Editor:

Alice M. Rivlin (Op-Ed, Nov. 12) says that ''a tax cut would hurt prospects for economic growth by encouraging more consumer spending and forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and avoid inflation.''
Curtailing consumer spending can't bring us anything but trouble.
Doesn't the Federal Reserve implicitly recognize the catastrophic dangers of deflation as it walks the tightrope of controlled growth?
The larger our economy grows, the more room there will be for Social Security benefits.
We can handle this without a misguided and puritanical effort to eliminate the federal debt.

Bell Atlantic Seen Entering The Long-Distance Market

Bell Atlantic today will become the first of the regional Bell companies allowed into the $80 billion long-distance market, signaling a new era of competition in the communications industry, people close to the decision said.
The announcement, which is expected from the Federal Communications Commission, would allow Bell Atlantic to sell long-distance services to the 6.6 million households it serves in New York State.
Approval would mark the first time since the breakup of AT&T 15 years ago that millions of consumers would be able to get both local and long-distance phone services from an AT&T offspring.

Stocks Surge on Decision by Fed

Two broad stock market gauges leaped to records, with the Nasdaq gaining 127.28 points, its biggest one-day gain ever, to 3,911.15, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbing 15.34 points, to 1,433.43.
The Dow Jones industrial average also was higher, closing at 11,200.54, up 56.27 points.

Instead, the attention was on whether there would be any interest in the two-year auction.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.45 percent from 6.46 percent on Tuesday.

With the Fed poised to raise rates again in the first quarter, some investors might have been reluctant to buy the two-year notes, which are among the most sensitive to changes in Fed rate policy.
Demand was weaker than at the last auction, judging by the bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the number of bids with the amount of securities sold.
For the last six auctions the average ratio has been 2.23 to 1.
Still, after the recent rise in yields, some investors found the securities attractive.
In the last month, two-year yields have climbed the most of all Treasury securities due in more than one year.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of two-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

High Price -- 99.800

High Yield -- 6.233%

Low Yield -- 6.142%

Median Yield -- 6.207%

Accepted at low price -- 19%

Total applied for -- $33,634,006

Accepted -- $17,176,006

Noncompetitive -- $1,296,561

Interest set at -- 6 1/8

The two-year notes mature Dec. 31, 2001.
Online Holiday Shopping Cuts Into Traditional Sales

Online holiday shopping is increasingly cutting into the business of traditional retailers this year, with preliminary indications that seasonal Internet sales may nearly triple from last year.
Visa estimates that Internet shoppers using its cards will have spent $1.47 billion this November and December, 179 percent more than in those months last year.
In the overall retail market, that figure is still small -- 1.74 percent of Visa's retail sales -- but it signals a troublesome phenomenon for traditional retailers, experts say.
Stores are finding that their best customers are the quickest to move online.

Fed Was Unanimous on Lifting Rates

The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee was unanimous in its decision to raise interest rates at its meeting on Nov. 16 and expressed a desire to act well before any Year 2000 computer problems, according to minutes of the meeting.
[C2.]
That fear has helped push the yield on the 30-year bond up almost half a percentage point since mid-November.
The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed rate moves, is at 6.23 percent, the highest it has been since May 1997.

The Fed has already raised its short-term interest rate target three-quarters of a percentage point in three quarter-point moves this year.
But the 5 percent growth rate of the nation's gross domestic product in the last six months is still well above the central bank's speed limit.
Such trends, the statement continued, ''could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary performance.''

But the recent performance of corporate bonds and riskier high-yield junk bonds, in comparison to the Treasury market, shows that investors are also getting back some of their appetite for risk, a signal that they are less worried about Year 2000.
Since Nov. 5, when the yield on the 30-year bond was 6.05 percent, it has risen 44 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
In that same time, the yield on junk bonds is up just 12 basis points, while corporate bond yields are up 35 basis points.
According to Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Honeig & Company in Rye Brook, N.Y., those numbers show that investors are selling government notes and bonds and buying corporate bonds because they do not think they need the protection that the essentially risk-free Treasury market provides.
The selling, of course, adds to the pressure on Treasuries.
And if there are no bad computer glitches at the turn of the year, the probability of problems ''goes from small to zero, and you have to conclude that the last vestige of Y2K hedges will be unwound,'' Mr. Barbera added.
That would mean more selling and even higher Treasury yields.
''I think Treasuries have more to give up,'' he said.
The Federal Reserve should get just as much credit for this relaxation of Year 2000 fears as it gets for the fears that it will raise its interest rate target next year.
Central bank officials have been aggressive in their efforts to assure that financial markets would not seize up near the end of 1999 and the start of 2000.
In seven separate weekly auctions, the Fed sold options that would guarantee the availability of billions of dollars in ready cash between Dec. 23 and Jan. 12.
In the seven auctions, the Fed sold $481 billion of insurance, easily enough to make a lot of investors feel comfortable.
It is not easy being a bear.
As the days have passed, some have suffered from tarnished reputations and the loss of clients -- even jobs.

''Who could have ever dreamed that this thing would go as far as it did?''
Certainly not David W. Tice, whose Prudent Bear mutual fund, which sells stocks short in anticipation that they will fall, has been one of the worst-performing of more than 3,000 mutual funds the last three years.
In recent years, he has advised investors to allocate more money to bonds and cash -- to the annoyance of many Merrill brokers.
Then there is Gail Dudack of Warburg Dillon Read, a market technician, who was abruptly bounced this autumn as a member of the so-called Elves Index panel on the ''Wall Street Week'' television program.
All along, the technology-driven stock market has soared with an irrepressible American economy as its accomplice; economic growth has persistently exceeded its supposed speed limits, while inflation has remained at bay.
In February, the uninterrupted expansion that began in March 1991 will set a longevity record, 107 months.
Productivity has also surged.
And the unemployment rate has sunk so low, scarcely above 4 percent, that many economists are rethinking its longstanding inverse relationship with inflation.
Indeed, an economy that once looked like a bubble of excessive exuberance, not unlike Japan's a decade ago, now seems highly resistant to forces like higher interest rates.
And a sage like Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor who is the top economic adviser to George W. Bush, can only regret that he sold his stocks 18 months and 2,800 Dow points ago, believing them overvalued.
Despite their errant predictions, members of the bear contingent of the 1990's remain convinced -- even adamant -- that they will be proved right.
And they have their reasons.
Their rationales go far beyond the structural bias on Wall Street that minimizes expression of the downbeat, that makes sell recommendations as rare as dinosaurs (as the chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission observed recently), and that can mean a loss of underwriting business or, for an analyst, being cut off from contact with a company's management.

In fact, some bears say their ranks are bigger than is evident -- and growing with each new breathtaking Nasdaq milestone.
''Some of our biggest clients,'' said James S. Chanos, president of Kynikos Associates, which bets on price declines, ''are some of Wall Street's leading executives.''
Many other market professionals, secretly worried, acknowledge privately that they remain fully invested against their better judgment.
''The problem is that a lot of people increasingly believe that it's a bubble -- but they're long,'' said Marc Faber, a onetime Wall Streeter who works in Hong Kong.
''When it changes direction, I think you will get big selling pressure.''
In other words, close to half of the large brokers and investment advisers the firm monitors are bearish on the overall market.
That compares with a fourth-quarter peak of 60 just before Thanksgiving.
Still, the bears remain outnumbered by the bulls, who see the new economy as justifying the ebullience.
They think the bears are transfixed by historical analysis.
''They're really children of the 70's,'' said Gail D. Fosler, chief economist for the Conference Board, a research group.
''There is just an incredible diffusion of technology'' that has raised productivity and thus economic prospects.
But it is not just the market's relentless climb that makes the bears bears.
They worry about stocks' grounding in economic reality, pointing to threats like the record American trade deficit and what they see as unsustainable consumer spending.
Leon Levy

Leon Levy, a founder of Oppenheimer & Company, whose Midas touch is the stuff of Wall Street legend, says it has been a ''humbling experience'' to have been so wrong on two counts: first, badly underestimating investors' love affair with technology in recent years and, of even greater consequence, doubting that the economy would get through the decade without a recession.
But he is not about to change.
Mr. Levy, relaxing in his capacious Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is filled with his renowned collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, sees storm clouds thickening in all directions.
When stocks fall, he added, today's avid investors are likely to turn into tomorrow's cautious consumers.

For Mr. Levy, who is 74, the talk of a new economic paradigm that dismisses the idea of recession -- and underpins the bull market -- arouses thoughts of the 1920's.
That is when cars became affordable for the average worker and a flood of inventions promised other previously unimaginable things.
''It seems to me they were not.''
Levy, from the family's Levy Institute Forecasting Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. -- is based on an observation by Leon Levy's father, Jerome Levy.
Before World War I, he expressed the belief, then surprising but now conventional wisdom, that profits are what make employers hire, generating other blessings.
Nowadays, the Levys worry that the reverse will happen: that a market break will cause consumers with a falling net worth to spend less, shrinking corporate profits and leaving the economy with a surfeit of office buildings, plants and machinery from what they contend has been far too much capital investment.
Leon Levy frets particularly about the rapidly expanding trade deficit, which reached another record in October, $25.9 billion, signaling a shift to production abroad.
''This is something that shows no sign of reversing, and it has to come to a bad end,'' he said.
Eventually, he added, it means fewer American jobs.
For now, though, David Levy said, the United States is short of workers, not jobs, and wage pressure is likely to push up inflation.
''If the economy doesn't slow down enough to give us disappointing profits, then interest rates are going to keep rising,'' he said.
''That greatly darkens the outlook for the stock market continuing this great mania that we've seen.''
It has yet to be sighted, of course.
And the Dow industrials have jumped more than 4,000 points since then.
Despite his pessimism, Leon Levy remains heavily invested in stocks, which he pays other, generally much younger people to manage.
His only hedge is taking short positions in some of the indexes.
''I certainly don't tell them what to do,'' he said.
''But I won't give money to a manager unless, when I ask him what he does when the market goes south, he has a well-thought-out answer.''

Marc Faber

Marc Faber has been a close witness to bucketsful of economic and financial distress since moving to Hong Kong from Wall Street in 1973.
Among them were Japan's 1989 stock market crash and the decadelong recession that ensued and may or may not have ended this year.
But nothing has impressed him as much -- or cost him so dearly -- as the wave of speculative ardor that has characterized the American stock market since at least 1996.
It has taught this colorful, ponytailed, motorcycle-riding investor and adviser some painful lessons.
''This is the biggest bubble I've seen,'' thundered Mr. Faber, 53, a Swiss-born skeptic who writes The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report, a monthly commentary for subscribers.
In a telephone interview from his office, where, as he commonly does, he was working well past midnight, he sounded like a true, if chastened, believer.
When assessing this market, he said, just look at the past.
''Everything is depressed compared to Yahoo,'' he said, ''but it's not necessarily depressed based on historical standards and compared to interest rates and compared to the earnings outlook.''
The ''good news,'' he contended, is that the bubble inevitably will burst -- perhaps as soon as January, a month with more than its share of historic reversals, including that of the Nikkei 225, Japan's benchmark stock index, a decade ago.

This implosion of stocks will drag the American economy, which has become dangerously subservient, along with it, he predicted.
''Should U.S. stocks decline by as much as I believe they will, a U.S. recession will follow,'' he said.
While Mr. Faber has made many accurate calls (he was one of the few who predicted the Asian meltdown) being bearish about the United States has proved expensive.
His short positions are losers, and he has made little or no gain putting money into gold and gold stocks, a strategy he has followed for years.
But if you concentrated on shorting what you perceived to be the most overvalued, it's that sector that has gone through the roof.''
That sector, of course, is high technology.
''I've been wrong about the U.S.,'' he acknowledged, citing two chief mistakes.

He is unnerved by what he considers to be an overly expansionary monetary policy here.
''How come the monetary base has been expanding at an annual rate of over 22 percent for the last three months?''
Many sell at unheard-of multiples of revenues and have no immediate prospect of earning a profit.
''I have underestimated the enthusiasm, the speculative fever and the greed in the United States and around the world,'' he said.
Barton M. Biggs

Though not the purest of the breed, Barton M. Biggs, who has been a relative bear on the American stock market for only 18 months, is as gloomy as the chief strategist of a major Wall Street house can afford to be.
''The technology, Internet and telecommunications craze has gone parabolic in what is one of the great, if not the greatest, manias of all time,'' he told Morgan Stanley clients in a recent essay on strategy.
Expanding on that theme in an interview, Mr. Biggs, 67 and a former marine, called stocks overpriced by some 45 to 50 percent, according to the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter valuation model.
The message: the place to put money is elsewhere.
''I'm convinced that over the next three to four years, the U.S. market is going to be the worst of the big markets in the world,'' Mr. Biggs said from his 22nd-floor Midtown Manhattan office.
''I think it's going to underperform next year by, let's say, 10 to 12 percentage points and over the next five years by 3 to 5 points a year.''
The problem, he said, is that the old economy is ''getting crushed'' by the so-called new one, resulting in a bifurcated stock market.
The old category includes consumer icons that have lost pricing power because of deflation as well as traditional smokestack manufacturers.
''Increasingly, the profitability of the old economy, ranging from Coke to Caterpillar, is under tremendous pressure,'' Mr. Biggs said.
Indeed, many old-economy stocks have dropped to near-depression levels.
''This is a wild thing that's happening here, this destruction of profitability.''
He, too, said the technology bubble would pop one day.
''I'm no longer convinced that the Internet part of the new economy is going to anywhere near live up to the expectations embedded in stock prices,'' he said, stopping just shy of predicting that the shakeout will bring down the rest of the market.

But Mr. Biggs is sticking to a global allocation of about 65 percent stocks and 35 percent bonds.
''I'm scared to death, but it's too painful to underweight stocks and hold a lot of cash and bonds,'' he said.
''You're risking your business.
They don't like it when you're in cash when the market goes up.''
James S. Chanos

Running what he believes to be the biggest short-selling operation in the world, Kynikos Associates, James S. Chanos is a professional bear.
Kynikos is derived from the Greek word for cynic, and Mr. Chanos makes his living finding stocks that are overvalued, then selling them in hopes of profiting from their eventual return to earth.
In this market, with the S.& P. 500 selling at 31.5 times earnings, nearly twice the historical norm, and with highfliers like eBay going for more than 1,000 times earnings, Mr. Chanos should be in his glory as he goes about deflating the overblown.
Instead, he has changed his ways.
The new fund really hedges -- that is, it matches short positions with an equal value of long ones, a market-neutral strategy that translates into betting only on his picks of individual stocks.
In other words, the stock market's rise was fueled by such a powerful force that it was preventing many overpriced stocks from going down.
It does not disclose results, but it is believed that Beta Hedge has returned about 17 percent a year since it was formed; its short-only cousin, Ursus Partners, has been flat.
Mr. Chanos, 42, takes no view about the likely direction of the market, but has not had much trouble these days finding unjustifiably inflated stocks.
He defines inflated stocks as those whose prices reflect discrepancies between investor perceptions and economic reality.
Corporate earnings provide evidence.
Most Internet companies have none at all, and at many profitable companies this decade, there has been a substantial decline in the quality of earnings.
Increasingly, Mr. Chanos said, they are overstated because of the proliferation of stock options, the phenomenon of repeated ''nonrecurring'' charges and the passage of legislation protecting executives from lawsuits.
This so-called safe-harbor law gives dishonest managements a chance to mislead investors with impunity, he said.

For all the opportunities to sell short, he must buck more than an unfavorable bullish trend.
Tax treatment of short-sellers is unfavorable, it is often hard to borrow stocks to sell short and there is a rule against selling short on downticks.
And there is the opprobrium of most of the investment world and the constant stream of upbeat Wall Street appraisal and company news.
His advice for ordinary investors is to avoid short-selling.
A much better way to reduce risk, he said, would be to ''sell down their longs.''
James Grant

The spare, paneled conference room seems to tell a lot: the rolltop desk, the old Underwood typewriter, the portrait of the losing 1888 Democratic ticket of Grover Cleveland and Allan G. Thurman.
And, yes, a large picture of William Holbrook Beard's painting, ''The Bear Dance.''
But James Grant, 53, the editor-entrepreneur whose office sits cater-cornered to the New York Stock Exchange, is neither a man of the 19th century nor a born pessimist.
He has been wrong about the stock market for a decade, he said, because he is a contrarian.
And being contrary in the 1990's meant playing Chicken Little while other people became rich.
''I am a skeptical person,'' said the 6-foot-5 Mr. Grant, a former columnist for Barron's, sometime TV commentator and proprietor of Grant's Financial Publishing.
''I am forever doubting received wisdom.
It's sometimes a profitable state of mind -- but often it's not.''
Mr. Grant, who once ordered up neckties depicting a bear wearing only a barrel, wryly calls himself ''the world's leading authority on where the stock market is not going.''
The stock market took off, creating enough wealth to negate the debt problems.
Unfortunately, Grant's kept on reading footnotes in corporate reports, he said, missing the forest for the trees.
With a certain regret -- though he says he is not sure he would have done much better as ''another voice in the choir'' -- Mr. Grant acknowledged that ''we have monumentally missed it on the all-important matter of common stocks.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Grant's Interest Rate Observer, his main publication, has had some latter-day on-the-money calls, positive and negative.
It was down, for example, on Coca-Cola, focusing on its accounting practices.
Coke, which has had many setbacks, has indeed seen its stock languish.
He was also on target in 1997, when he saw CMGI, a sort of supertechnology holding company then selling at about $12, as worth more than the sum of its parts.
It now fetches more than $270.
According to a successful old Wall Streeter, he said, bears always sound smarter but their thinking can prove a trap.
''The truly perceptive person, knowing that, knows when's the time not to doubt,'' Mr. Grant said.
Now, while a majority of American stocks have fallen from their highs -- and declining stocks have persistently outnumbered advancing ones -- Mr. Grant is not ready to return to Wall Street.
He finds one of the best opportunities in Japan, the mirror image of the 1980's and ''the beginnings of something terrific.''
This time, he is backing his opinion with cash.
He founded a hedge fund concentrating on the small-capitalization Japanese stocks that he thinks had sunk to bargain prices (and have risen lately).
''I happen to have been profoundly wrong, negative on this greatest of all bull markets,'' he said, referring to his misjudgment in the United States.
''But I've resolved I'm not going to miss the next once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
''Where would I go?
What will I do?''

She feels fortunate that Ariel's premature birth did not cause any major health complications.
Doctors have told her that he will not have any speech impediments and does not have asthma, both of which are risks for premature children, she said.
And he's about the right size for a 6-month-old.
''If there are problems,'' she said recently as she fed Ariel his first bottle of the day, ''there are solutions.''

''But the negative side,'' he adds, ''is that you have to go through surgery, and you may die.''
This thriving anti-cancer movement, replete with the testimonials of cured patients, is one of hundreds of variants of qigong (pronounced chee-goong) that continue operating in China, even as the authorities pursue their harsh crackdown on one prominent offshoot, Falun Gong, and step up their scrutiny of the others.
The official acceptance of some qigong sects while others are crushed is part of a two-decade, often tortuous effort by the government to distinguish supposedly scientific, beneficial qigong from practices that are labeled superstitious and then curbed.
On Sunday, four leaders were given stiff prison sentences for, among other charges, allegedly telling ill followers that they could dispense with conventional medicine.
Since the campaign to eradicate Falun Gong began, attendance in the anti-cancer group here in Yuyuantan Park has dropped off sharply, Mr. Yu, himself a long-term cancer survivor, made a point of saying, because people fear attracting the attention of the police.
But the group has patrons high in scientific circles, avoids making broad spiritual claims and has not held anything like the illegal demonstrations that got Falun Gong into trouble, and Mr. Yu continues to proselytize without being bothered.
From the beginning it presented the Communist authorities with a conundrum.
''They wanted to retain the best qualities of qigong, and they believe that it really does have healing properties.
Whether the situation is parallel or not, tense officials are well aware that mystical cults in the past have erupted into huge, disruptive political forces, like the Taiping Rebellion of the mid-19th century and the Boxers at the turn of the 20th century.

The distinctions between supposedly valid and bogus forms of qigong are blurry, because every sect has masters claiming what by Western standards are supernatural powers.
But ongoing groups like the anti-cancer club in the park are especially careful now to limit their claims.
While many doctors here who are trained in Western medicine scoff at the medical claims, qigong has had influential supporters, and some senior political leaders over the years have consulted qigong masters.

The country's most famous scientist, Qian Xuesen, who returned from the United States in the early 1950's to help develop China's missiles and nuclear weapons, has long been a proponent of qigong, writing in the 1980's, for example, ''Truly top-class qigong masters really do have some physical paranormal powers.''
A key patron of the Guo Lin anti-cancer sect is Feng Lida, a politically well connected, Soviet-trained medical doctor who is deputy director of the General Navy Hospital in Beijing.
''These experiments told us that it is really science,'' Dr. Feng said in her Beijing office, next to photographs of her shaking hands with President Jiang, the legislative leader Li Peng and the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
''Qigong is a Chinese treasure.''
Dr. Feng now hopes to spread qigong, along with good nutrition and attention to crucial details like sleeping with one's head pointed to the north, in alignment with magnetic fields, as a low-cost way to meet the country's health care needs.

Around the Oasis of Life marker in Yuyuantan Park, the mood is surprisingly cheerful as cancer patients who have completed their long walks chat and exchange tips.
It is clear that if nothing else, the qigong club acts as a kind of support group for the seriously ill.

''We try to create a joyous atmosphere,'' Mr. Yu said.
''We call this building group resistance.
If a patient becomes desperate, no medicine can cure him.''
Mr. Yu went on to explain elaborate theories about how the walking exercises and meditation free the flows of qi energy and blood through the body, strengthening defenses against disease.
Among the regulars are several longtime survivors and total believers in the power of qi.
So she started practicing Guo Lin qigong, learning from the founding master in Purple Bamboo Park nearby.
He said, recalling the four hours of walking each morning.
''I never dreamed that I would survive very long.''
Now she helps teach qigong to others as she continues modified exercise herself.
''I'm still just learning how to do it, and I haven't felt any beneficial effect yet,'' he said.
''But the group spirit provides good support.
They are all really determined to resist cancer.''
Reports on consumer confidence and home sales exceeded market forecasts, solidifying the already rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase rates as soon as February to slow economic growth.
''Quite obviously, consumers remain highly optimistic, and are likely to continue to spend freely over the near term.''
''Meanwhile,'' he added, ''the 6 percent jump in November existing- home sales was a clear signal that the housing market, while perhaps past its peak, is still quite vibrant, and is not yet displaying any signs of an impending economic slowdown.''

The unemployment rate is currently at a very low 4.1 percent and gross domestic product growth was at a blistering 5.7 percent pace for the third quarter and is widely projected to show continued strength for the fourth quarter.
Given all that, Mr. Fine said the members of the Fed's policy-setting committee ''must be squirming in their seats as they nervously analyze this steady stream of buoyant economic data, which at the same time is further solidifying the already widespread expectation of bond market participants of further tightening by the Fed during the first quarter.''
Although the stock and bond markets have largely uncoupled in recent weeks, the strength in the stock market has been pressing bond investors, with some buyers of Government securities electing instead to dabble in stocks.
The only economic indicator left for 1999 that could move the market is a report on regional manufacturing activity by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago, scheduled for release on Friday.
The survey is closely watched for trends in nationwide manufacturing activity.
But investors are already anticipating data due out in early January, including the December jobs report, the December survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management and inflation indicators.
Even though the bond market can be expected to get some support from investors attracted to the current high yields, Treasuries might not fall much further.
Bonds have registered their worst annual performance since the Treasury began selling the 30-year issue regularly in 1977.
They have handed investors losses of 12.6 percent this year, taking reinvested interest into account.
THE EURO FALLS.
And if all that cash ultimately is not needed, banks will return it to the government, to be recirculated some day or shredded and left in landfills.

The complacency about cash is just the latest sign that the public is taking the prospect of Year 2000 computer disruptions in stride.
Of course, problems could yet occur, sending depositors flocking to their local branches.
Bankers and regulators acknowledge this, noting that even in a world grown accustomed to the pleasures of plastic credit cards, there is nothing quite as reassuring as cold hard cash.
''The biggest variable in the equation remains public perception,'' said Doug Tillett, a spokesman with the New York Federal Reserve.
''We really don't know how people will react.''
So far, there has been little to give consumers pause, although flare-ups have occurred.
On Tuesday, about 20,000 credit card terminals in Britain began to stall because of computer glitches, holding up holiday shoppers.
A spokeswoman for HSBC Holdings, the large British bank that operates most of the terminals, said the devices could not recognize the year 2000 but that the problem would be resolved by Jan. 1.
Nonetheless, at least in the United States, bankers feel prepared for Year 2000 headaches and are satisfied that they have plenty of cash to dole out should people want it.
Simply getting all that cash into the system has been a challenge.
Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department directed the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to begin printing the extra billions.
Most of the $220 billion in reserve cash is held in Federal Reserve coffers around the country, awaiting orders from banks should they need it.
A smaller portion, about $72 billion, is already in bank vaults, about $20 billion more than banks typically keep on hand this time of year.
So long as the reserves are not drawn down, the mere printing of extra cash has no inflationary effect.
For banks, holding more of their assets in extra cash means that they can lend less and thus earn less money.
So far analysts are not concerned that the impact on bank earnings or the economy itself will be substantial, as long as the need for extra wads of cash remains a short-term event.

If and when the all-clear is sounded, banks will quickly ship that pool of extra cash back to the Federal Reserve -- setting the vast conga line of planes and armored cars back in motion.
For its part, Chase has set up 27 special command centers to monitor its banking network 24 hours a day between Dec. 31 and Jan. 11.
The bank even increased its paper supply in the event that a flurry of receipts or bank statements needed to be printed, and it has been funneling extra cash into its branches since October.
Still, extra cash is in the branches, and that presents security concerns for Chase, other banks and the armored car companies that serve them.

Banks and armored car companies say they have bolstered security to protect this momentary cash hoard.
''The holiday season is always tough, but with additional money out there we're putting more security on the street and around our cars,'' said Kevin Dunbar, chief operating officer of Dunbar Armored, an armored car company that operates from 80 locations around the country.
Banks also have been simulating crises to prepare themselves for a range of computer-related disasters, not just a run on cash.
Wells Fargo, the large San Francisco bank, has completed three practice runs in which its personnel had to negotiate 25 potential problems.
Some banks already have had a taste of crisis management.
In the fall, Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., had to rush cash to branches on the Atlantic coast so depositors could get their money before evacuating in advance of a hurricane.
Oversight for Citigroup, one of the largest and most ubiquitous financial institutions in the world, is a tad more complex.
To do that, Citigroup has set up a special central command center in an undisclosed location in the United States.
Information about the bank's activities is fed to that center from 15 regional command centers in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
Most banks in the United States, meanwhile, are just keeping their fingers crossed.
And counting on consumers to keep their heads.
''We've tried to make it clear to people that the safest place for your money is in the bank,'' said Steve Dishart, a spokesman for Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh.
''People seem to be taking that at face value.''
At a time of record prosperity and robust retail sales, dead malls litter the landscape, from the haunt of the old Naugatuck Valley Mall in Waterbury, Conn., to the icon of Valley Girl culture, the Sherman Oaks Galleria in Southern California.

Nearly 1 of every 5 shopping malls standing in 1990 will be out of business by the end of next year, according to ''Emerging Trends in Real Estate,'' an annual report for institutional property buyers jointly published by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Lend Lease Real Estate Investments Inc., both of New York.
The older malls are falling because of retail Darwinism, losing customers to bigger, more entertaining shopping centers, although the rate at which new malls are being built is also the lowest in 20 years.
Other malls are also losing customers to catalog and Internet shopping and to big-box stores like Wal-Mart.
Perhaps the biggest factor in the decline of older malls, real estate experts say, is that there are too many stores for shoppers to support.
The husks of older malls are giving certain developers, architects and planners a chance to prove with bricks and glass what they could only dream about.
The de-malling of America, as these urban specialists see it, provides the perfect space for compact new neighborhoods -- where people park their cars and walk between shops and home.
''Where malls have started to die, you have a chance for some very exciting new uses -- 24-hour neighborhoods,'' said Mark Falcone, managing director of Continuum Partnership, a Denver developer.
''What used to seem so threatening to a lot of developers is seen now as just a return to the common-sense wisdom of how people want to live and shop.''
What happened to the mall, born in the Midwest in the 1950's about the same time as Interstate highways, is an old story of free market excess.
Now there are nearly 40,000 shopping centers and 19 square feet of retail space per capita.
In the last 12 years alone, shopping space has increased 34 percent, to a total of more than 5 billion square feet.
''The formats are stale and boring,'' said Jonathan D. Miller, the main author of the ''Emerging Trends'' report.
''The traffic hassles are awful, and people just generally don't have the time to spend wandering around malls like they used to.''
More than $1 trillion still changes hands every year in malls in the United States.
But people are spending less time in the retail biospheres than ever before, according to several studies.
Even teenagers, whose shopping habits and dialect have provided anthropological fodder for a generation of mall sociologists, are getting bored with the old format, experts say.
''Malls tried to be our social centers, but they're not interesting enough, not diverse enough,'' said Peter Calthorpe, a Berkeley urban planner and architect who is one of the nation's leading promoters of the return to village-square-style neighborhoods, the so-called New Urbanist movement.

Mr. Calthorpe designed the Crossings here in Mountain View, and his company has nearly a dozen similar projects under way, even in sprawl meccas like Las Vegas and Phoenix.
''Main-street-style centers have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years,'' Mr. Calthorpe said.
''But the big suburban mall is a highly subsidized experiment that's barely 40 years old, and may eventually be seen as an aberration.''
It is one thing for a well-known city planner like Mr. Calthorpe to see the demise of sprawl-born malls, but even Wall Street is singing the same tune.
In advising investors to stay away from suburban malls, ''Emerging Trends'' said: ''Whether mall owners want to admit it or not, malls look the same from one end of the country to the other.
Same stores, similar merchandise, same fast food and same movies.
If shopping is entertainment, then going to the local mall is like watching TV reruns over and over again.''
Adding to the problem are people buying over the Internet.
1 retailer, revolutionizing commerce and drawing money from old-style malls anchored by traditional department stores.
Now Amazon.com is projected by some analysts to eventually become the nation's top retailer.

Big regional shopping centers, anchored by major stores, and small neighborhood retail squares built around a favorite supermarket, are the two healthiest of the species.
Outlet stores, the name-brand discounters clustered at the far edge of exurbia, have leveled off, with about 300 nationwide.
''The mall will continue to evolve into a place that is far more than shirts, shoes and slacks,'' said John Bucksbaum, the chief executive officer of General Growth Properties, the largest manager of shopping malls in the nation.
''Today, people want more.
They want to be entertained.
They want to be able to sit down and eat, and not just at a food court.
They want a Starbucks.''
A new hybrid, known as the main-street mall, has sprouted throughout the country to great success.
These centers are somewhat like the village square of old, with single-story stores, coffee shops and restaurants facing a sidewalk, often with a fountain or square in the middle, and underground parking.
One such main-street mall, Redmond Town Square in the wealthy suburb east of Seattle, has become a favorite social haunt for Microsoft employees, who work several miles away.

Some critics say the main-street mall is more of a Disneyland fantasy than a true evocation of America's village past.
And others wonder if the New Urbanists' creations, with their retro front porches and pastel colors, will one day look as dated as the older malls of today.
But for people who have bemoaned the course of ever-expanding American suburbs tied to the automobile, the return to smaller, more compact developments -- though in dead malls, of all places -- is an extraordinary turn of events.
California, which pioneered so many of the drive-by conveniences that marked the auto age, is leading the charge in trying to develop old malls into places where the car is obsolete.
One example is in Pasadena, where an old-style downtown shopping center will be replaced with a series of small shops with 400 loft-style apartments above the stores.
In Los Angeles, a similar plan is under way near the city's old farmer's market, at Fairfax and Third Avenues, where a complex of more than 600 condominiums, built around small shops and cafes, will replace a mall of discount stores.
''It's taking what is frankly a not very healthy and nondescript area and making it quite vibrant and livable,'' said Con Howe, the planning director for Los Angeles.
''People now want to live where the jobs are, and where they can shop and dine in the same place.''
Putting homes atop small retail shops was once the norm for most cities, but the practice was eventually outlawed by zoning codes.
What is happening now, city planners say, reflects the limitations of sprawl and the desire of people to get out of their cars.
''If you live in the cul-de-sac and have to drive to the dry cleaners, along with every other place -- people are getting fed up with that,'' said Mr. Miller of Lend Lease, the nation's largest institutional real estate manager.
Some baby boomers, as their children leave home, are leaving the suburbs, and many people in their 20's and 30's either cannot afford new homes in the suburbs or want to be closer to the big cities, where technology jobs are being created at a furious rate.

''The first-generation mall is no longer the edge of the city -- it's right smack in the middle of the city,'' said Mr. Falcone, who is conducting a study with Harvard University on the dead-mall phenomenon.
''That makes it a good location for something other than an auto-dependent mall.''
Here in Silicon Valley, nearly 10 jobs are being created for every new housing unit -- bringing a huge demand to retrofit some older, dying malls.
The Crossings has been so successful that it has spawned similar plans for older malls throughout the Bay area.
It may even get to the point where Tom Wolfe's description of sprawl could become obsolete.
Then he suffocated them, later dissolving their bodies in large vats of acid.

Mr. Iqbal, 38, a wealthy, tormented man, kept an annotated list of his deeds, with his victims' names and ages and the dates of their deaths.
He decided that the killing of children would be his means of retribution.

Criticism of the police has been immense, with riots in Lahore.
He surrendered on Thursday at the three-story offices shared by the The Jang, an Urdu-language publication, and its sister paper, The News, which is written in English.
The two, Muhammad Shahzad and Muhammad Nadeem, were caught trying to cash a traveler's check in the name of Javed Iqbal.
Mr. Iqbal, who lived off the money from the sale of a family business, contends that he was helped him in the murders by various confederates, including one who has already died in police custody.
''Then my friends would place the body in a container and later drain it away.''
Such easily abused chemicals are a great danger to society, Mr. Iqbal said.
Mr. Barak's previously announced choice, Elhanan Helpman, an economics professor at Harvard University, has turned down the offer, officials said.
The prime minister has come under increasing criticism for failing to find a candidate to be governor of the Bank of Israel since Mr. Frenkel informed him this fall that he intended to resign at the end of 1999.
Mr. Frenkel, who has served as central bank governor since 1991, announced in mid-November that Jan. 2 would be his last day in office.
Mr. Barak will designate a new bank chief by Sunday, Mr. Frenkel said.
''It is very important that there not be a situation of complete vacuum in which there is neither a governor nor a candidate whose name has been made public,'' the bank chief said, explaining his decision to accede to Mr. Barak's last-minute request.

Hours earlier, Mr. Frenkel had reiterated his intention to leave office at the end of work today, despite the lack of a designated successor.

Mr. Frenkel, who has been both praised and assailed for the tight-money policies that have marked his tenure, recently eased interest rates.
Investors and financial analysts appear to have been reassured by the prime minister's promise that he would appoint a new governor in Mr. Frenkel's independent but economically orthodox mold.
''It is not so important who holds the steering wheel, but where the steering wheel moves,'' Mr. Frenkel said today.
Experts say that predicting weather in Europe remains particularly difficult, despite the latest technology.
Most meteorologists rely heavily on computerized models that must be fed a great number of up-to-the-minute weather observations.
The problem is that many of Europe's weather patterns come off the Atlantic Ocean, where observations are sparse.
Key factors may not be detected, so the models, never fool-proof, have a greater chance of failing.
''But it's always hard to get good information over the Atlantic.
There are boats out there that send wind, temperature and pressure information and we get information from satellites, too, but they look down over what is going on from very high up.
We just don't get a good picture of everything going on over the sea.''
Severe fall and winter storms are not rare in Europe, Mr. Galois said.
In late October 1987, for instance, a storm with 100-mile winds paralyzed London, killing 13 people and destroying some 1,000 trees at Kew Gardens, the world's oldest and most famous arboretum.
In early 1990, storms with hurricane-force winds slashed through Western Europe three times in six weeks, killing more than 140 people and causing perhaps a billion dollars in damage.
Usually, weather patterns take 48 hours.
Whether or not global warming will be a factor in creating more such storms remains an open question.

''It does not create storms, but maybe it will have an effect on them,'' Mr. Galois said.
''If the oceans are warmer, that could be another source of energy out there that might intensify a storm.''
Some climatologists say that if the atmosphere warms as predicted, storms will become more intense.
But while there is some evidence that rainstorms have become heavier in some parts of the world, there is no solid indication of stronger wind storms.
At any rate, experts say, no specific weather development can yet be attributed to global climate change.
The two storms that struck Europe beginning Dec. 26 are the kind that develop along a front, or boundary, between cold arctic air and warmer southern air that circles the globe.
Above this boundary is the jet stream, the high altitude river of air in which most storm systems are embedded, and that carries them on a general west-to-east course.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In this case, meteorologists say, the jet stream was classically placed and of classic strength to promote the development of superstorms.
This is the kind of atmosphere setup that can cause a storm to blossom explosively if one should develop.
The faster the jet stream, the more air it whisks away from the area of a developing storm below it.
This further lowers the air pressure within the storms (by taking air away from them).
The lower the pressure, the faster air rushes in from outside the storm to try to equalize things.
This rush of air is wind, and the lower the storm's pressure, the stronger it is.
The storms themselves were relatively small vortexes of wind and precipitation circling counterclockwise around a central core.
Some tornadoes might have spun off, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.
The first storm hit northern France hardest.
The second tore through the southern half of the country.
Fog prevented some helicopters from taking off.
Snow and flooding were also making repairs more difficult.
Most economists believe Alan Greenspan is more responsible for the economy's spectacular performance than Congress, Presidents Bush and Clinton or any other identifiable factor.
Under his leadership the Federal Reserve Board has driven inflation and unemployment down to 30-year lows.
Mr. Greenspan is widely regarded as one of the most successful chairmen in the history of the Fed.
Yesterday President Clinton wisely nominated him to a fourth term, ending disruptive speculation that he might decide to appoint someone else.
Twelve years later, the inflation rate -- the one economic outcome for which the Fed is entirely responsible -- has fallen to about 2 percent, about as low as many economists deem advisable.
Interest rates have fallen significantly, and unemployment is at its lowest level in decades, around 4 percent.
Mr. Greenspan has been both lucky and very astute.
He did not produce the low foreign oil prices or higher productivity growth that have occurred during his tenure.
But by setting clear objectives and exercising smart judgment, he let the economy take full advantage of both trends.
His goal is low, steady inflation, and he has not allowed the Fed to become sidetracked by focusing on foreign exchange rates, stock prices or the growth rate of the economy.
Next, points out Mickey Levy, chief economist at the Bank of America, he has exercised timely judgment.
In 1998 the Fed reduced rates to inoculate the economy against the financial crisis sweeping across Asia.
The upshot of these successful decisions is that investors trust Mr. Greenspan.
They do not overreact -- driving interest rates higher and aborting recoveries -- at the first sign of inflationary pressure because they trust that he will keep inflation in check.

Mr. Greenspan did not create the labor markets that have allowed unemployment to fall to its lowest levels since the 1960's without setting wages ablaze.
Yesterday Mr. Clinton assured that his careful stewardship of the economy will continue.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, climbed to 6.62 percent from 6.54 percent Tuesday.
''This is just one of those indiscriminate sell-offs'' in an inherently volatile sector.
After plunging a record 229.46 points, or 5.6 percent, on Tuesday, the Nasdaq fell nearly 167 points, or 4.27 percent, in early trading, but the market staged a comeback, even poking briefly into positive territory, before falling back to finish with its modest loss.
Volume was 1.73 billion shares, second only to the record 1.78 billion on Dec. 9.

The market's performance follows the historical pattern, said Donald M. Selkin, chief equity strategist at Joseph Gunnar & Company.
I.B.M., recommended by Banc of America Securities, accounted for nearly one-quarter of the Dow's advance, rising 6 3/16, to 118 1/4, before slipping back in after-hours trading.
Utility stocks, which pay relatively large dividends and tend to be seen as havens in rough markets, posted hefty gains.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.56 percent from 6.62 percent on Wednesday.
The central bank's monetary policy committee is expected to raise rates by at least 25 basis points, or one-quarter of a percentage point, at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Feb. 1 and 2.
''Basically the market has priced in a Fed move and given the central bank a green light to raise short-term rates,'' said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla. ''It now becomes a question of how much of an increase the Fed is planning.''
The number was well above the increase of 12,000 that was anticipated, indicating the labor market's tightness may be easing, potentially reducing pressures on wages.

''Activity was thin and any uptick today is not justifiable until we see the jobs report on Friday,'' Mr. Pugliese said.

The report is expected to show the economy added 250,000 new payroll jobs in December, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.1 percent.
The average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 percent.
Late in the day Treasuries also rose from market talk that the Treasury would release details of its buyback program and would increase the number of callable issues.
Elsewhere, the World Bank said it would sell $3 billion in debt securities in what would be the first global electronic bond offering to be sold, distributed and traded online.
Lead managers will be Goldman, Sachs & Company and Lehman Brothers.
Some, and especially the mayor, say it is a badly needed measure to control a growing pigeon population.
Others view it as a form of anthropocentricity that clashes with the town's animal-loving ethos.

''We respect the mayor's decision, but we do not agree with it,'' said the Rev.
Vincenzo Fortunato, the spokesman for the Franciscan order of Assisi.
''We believe there are alternatives that respect animals and the environment.''
But like most custodians of churches and historic buildings in Italy, the Franciscan friars have put up thin wiring that emits an electrical impulse that repels birds along parts of their restored basilica to protect the 13th-century building from pigeon excrement.
Local environmentalists are even more upset.
''St.
''This order doesn't take into consideration the whole problem, it just gives out prohibitions.''
But even animal rights groups concede that there is no easy solution to limiting the country's rapidly multiplying urban pigeon population.
Reducing the amount of food available and limiting nesting sites is a partial solution.
Marco Dinetti, a national coordinator of the Italian League for the Protection of Birds, said that in addition, introducing natural predators like the falcon or the tawny owl to cities would be ''ecologically sound and not cruel.''
He warned: ''You have to do food reduction ethically.
You cannot just take away food overnight and stop people from feeding the pigeons.''
But Venice, a city where there are almost twice as many pigeons as people, and where signs ordering tourists not to feed pigeons are cheerfully ignored, has taken a harsher route.
There, since the end of 1998, about 20,000 pigeons have been captured and gassed.
''If we could find a falcon that could eat 50,000 pigeons, everyone would applaud, but it doesn't exist,'' said Mario Scattolin, director of Venice's Environmental Office.
''Nature is what it is, not what Walt Disney shows us.''

Giorgio Bartolini, the mayor of Assisi, said he would not dream of introducing extermination measures to his town and merely wanted to reduce the pigeon population by cutting back feedings and closing up windows and holes in abandoned buildings where pigeons congregate.

''Assisi cannot serve as a welcome center for pigeons,'' Mr. Bartolini warned.
''I am not saying that we have an epidemic on hand, but their growth rate is alarming, and they damage buildings and pose a health risk to people.''
Experts disagree on the degree of risk, but pigeons have been linked to the spread of salmonella, ticks and allergies.
''St.
''I have no interest in becoming a saint.
I am trying to apply common sense and pragmatism.''
In Assisi he has some supporters.
Until a few years ago, locals used to feed pigeons corn on the piazza when the church bells rang at noon.
The church now has anti-pigeon wiring along its roof, and the ritual noon feedings have stopped.
There are other pigeon experts who say people have taken St. Francis' teachings too far.
''St.
''Man is the pigeon's natural predator.''
But other aviary historians disagree.
Richard F. Johnston, a scholar at the Natural History Museum of the University of Kansas, said pigeons could be found around coastal Europe in 10,000 B.C.
According to F. R. Cowell's ''Life in Ancient Rome,'' pigeons were a delicacy served at the kind of Roman bacchanals that enrich ''The Satyricon'' of Petronius.

Art in Assisi, moreover, suggests that St. Francis not only met pigeons, but also talked to them.
It shows St. Francis preaching to birds, and some art historians identify them as sparrows, quails and also pigeons.
''Italians are undisciplined,'' he said wearily, ''and they are also sentimental about very stupid things.''
In reality, the economy bounced back quickly from the initial blow, closing the year with positive growth, and with interest rates at 26 percent and the real trading at 1.83 to the dollar.

As a result, Brazilian legislators simply do not feel the same sense of urgency or international pressure as they did a year ago.
In addition, it is the middle of a glorious summer here, which may help explain why fewer than one-fifth of the 594 members of Congress were on hand for the first quorum call this week.
''This convocation is unnecessary and expensive,'' complained Geddel Vieira Lima, leader of the delegation of one of the parties in the government coalition.
''I don't see how we can vote on this entire agenda in this period of time.''
The ambitious agenda for the special session, which is scheduled to last until mid-February, includes renewal of Mr. Cardoso's line-item veto authority over the budget, reform of the tax and pensions systems and changes in labor laws.
Other measures under consideration are limits on spending by municipalities and states and salary ceilings for government employees.

The government argues that passage of its reform measures is essential if it is to meet performance targets set in the $41.5 billion economic rescue package it signed with the International Monetary Fund in November 1998.
But with nationwide municipal elections scheduled for October, legislators want to be generous to win favor with voters, not to keep belts tightened.
Mr. Cardoso has ''had more problems with his supporters than the opposition,'' the business daily Gazeta Mercantil concluded after that incident.
That amnesty would have applied to more than 80 legislators and nine state governors, many of whom the president has been counting on to support his legislative package but who are now highly offended.
''The veto could induce reprisals from lawmakers and put at risk the approval of measures that are of obvious urgency to the country,'' the daily O Estado de Sao Paulo warned in a recent editorial.
The newspaper criticized the behavior of legislators as ''shameful,'' warning that the bill, which Congress is threatening to override, ''indirectly authorizes an anything-goes attitude'' in the campaign leading up to the October vote.
Additional grounds for conflict between Congress and the president exist in a proposal by legislators to give themselves a 50 percent pay increase, to $80,000 a year.
In a country where the minimum wage is $900 a year, the proposal is extremely unpopular and goes against Mr. Cardoso's emphasis on fiscal discipline and sacrifice.
''I would prefer that Congress be on the side of public opinion,'' the president said just after Christmas, referring specifically to his veto of the electoral amnesty measure.
To act in any other fashion, he added, is ''demoralizing'' to the country ''and leaves a sensation of impunity.''
And indeed, Priceline.com now offers a range of products including hotels, cars and groceries.
In each of these areas, the concept is the same: customers get to propose the price, but Priceline gets to pick the actual hotel, car dealer or brand of chicken soup.
If customers can get a Visa card with the interest rate and features they want, why would they care which bank actually offered the card?
Priceline is finally set to announce a name-your-own-price credit card system today.
But there is only one card issuer -- NextCard Inc. -- rather than competing providers as in most of Priceline's other markets.
Credit cards, it turns out, are harder in some ways even than airplane tickets, said Richard Braddock, Priceline's chief executive.

Under its existing system, NextCard, a two-year-old San Francisco company takes applications online (NextCard.com), looks up the applicant's credit history and offers a choice of three different card products with different rates, fees and other features.
People with better credit records and those willing to transfer big balances, get better deals.
On Priceline.com, by contrast, customers will fill out a short application and will also describe the credit card features they want: An interest rate, an annual fee, a credit limit, and optionally a rewards program (like travel miles).
The system will instantly respond, either by offering that card, or offering alternative structures that are close to what the applicant wanted.

In particular, NextCard will check how much the applicant owes on other cards and will offer lower rates if customers transfer all their balances to the new card.
It is unclear, however, that in the absence of competing banks, whether NextCard will offer any better deals on Priceline than it does on its own site.
Dan Springer, NextCard's director of marketing, said the company had every incentive to satisfy those customers who go through the bother of expressing interest on Priceline.
''If someone says they want a 7.9 percent card, and I normally would give them a 9.9 card, I'm highly motivated to give them what they want,'' he said.
But on the other hand, Mr. Springer concedes that NextCard could well find itself charging higher prices to Priceline customers because they turn out to be less loyal than card holders from other sources.
''I have some concern that a Priceline type of customer may be less attractive because they are more focused on finding the best deal,'' said ''Many people don't shop around and just want a simple solution.''

The big price gains over the last two sessions have left some traders and analysts a bit troubled.

-------------------- Treasury Prices Fall

By Bloomberg News

Bond prices fell yesterday, pushing yields close to their highest level in more than two years, on concern that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates a half-point this quarter to rein in growth.
Bonds have ''an enormous hurdle to cross to be competitive with the stock market,'' said Jack Kallis, who helps oversee $1.5 billion at State Street Research and Management in Boston.
Yields on 30-year bonds will ''have to get to 7 percent to draw people's attention,'' he said.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.59 percent, from 6.54 percent on Friday.
Treasuries may decline further this week after reports on producer and consumer prices, which are expected to show inflation quickened in December.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

Police Commissioner Howard Safir said yesterday that the city, facing a possible mass exodus of seasoned police officers eligible for retirement, should consider awarding bonuses or other incentives to those who agree to stay on.
Over the next five years, the number of officers who reach 20 years of service and eligibility for retirement with full benefits will rise significantly, according to police statistics.
It is possible that many of them will leave their high-stress jobs, take their lucrative pensions and look for employment in the private sector.
Although only 1,500 officers in the 40,000-member force are eligible to retire this year, by 2004 the number will climb to almost 11,000, or more than one in four.
The retirement number is already beginning to climb, police officials said, with 888 officers retiring last year, compared with 617 in 1998.

Some cities, he said, allow police officers to begin earning pension stipends even while collecting their regular salaries, and award them a lump sum several years later when they actually retire.
Others, he said, award a form of signing bonus to veterans who agree to stay on past their eligible retirement date.
''I think we have to explore all of those possibilities,'' Mr. Safir said, ''and we have to decide what's best for the police officer and what's fiscally responsible for the city.''
But police union officials said that the city must also confront the fact that many officers are leaving not because of outside economic lures, but because they are fed up with pressures within the department.
The union officials said that in addition to unsatisfactory pay, many officers are frustrated by what they characterize as the strain of having to produce ever more glowing rates of crime reduction.

''There is constant pressure from the top to the bottom for performance, performance and performance, an insistence on increases in summonses, an insistence on the number of arrests and a constant change of tours that many cops are tired of,'' said Thomas Scotto, president of the Detectives Endowment Association.
Mr. Safir, who has said he does not believe police morale is sagging, said he hoped to discuss possible solutions for the problem with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the near future.
The issue has arisen now because of an unusual surge in the number of people about to become eligible to leave the force.
Next year 1,511 more officers will become eligible, and 2,083 officers the year after that.
If only some of them actually retire, the number leaving the force would grow by hundreds.
For many officers, the decision to leave is simple economics.
With overtime and other additions, the average police officer at retirement age earns about $60,000, according to police personnel officials.
Yet after taxes, union dues and pension contributions are deducted, an officer often takes home just a bit more than 50 percent of his salary.
On the other hand, with a pension that pays 50 percent of their salary, a supplemental pension payout that provides $8,000 a year and a reduced tax bill, officers often find they can nearly match their working salary by leaving the force.
And if they get another job, retirement becomes an economic boon.
''The one thing that keeps cops on the job is a financial incentive,'' said Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
''The salary we are getting now is not enough to keep our families and keep our homes.
If we would give them a decent, livable wage, that would be incentive for police officers to stay on the job.''
In the latest evidence that inflation remains in check, consumer prices rose only modestly in December even as the economy roared toward a record for uninterrupted expansion, Labor Department figures showed yesterday.
A lower-than-expected rise in the Consumer Price Index of 0.2 percent and reassuring comments Thursday evening by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, helped propel the Dow Jones industrial average to this week's third record close.
But after the government's report on inflation and other data on industrial output and inventories, word came in midmorning that consumers may have become unduly optimistic.
That could mean continuation of a breakneck spending pace that the Fed has been trying to arrest.
It is all but certain, analysts say, that the Fed will decide on a quarter-point rise at its two-day meeting at the beginning of February.
Last month's rise in consumer prices lifted the 1999 inflation rate to 2.7 percent, with the acceleration from 1998's 1.6 percent reflecting a sharp jump in the price of oil.
Energy prices surged 13.4 percent last year after falling 8.8 percent in 1998.

In a statement with the report, Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said the economy was ''strong and growing and should be nominated for best picture'' at the Academy Awards.

That stance is perceived despite an increase of 0.9 percent in inventories in November, which suggested that the economy's growth rate could approach 6 percent for the quarter.
Analysts hope that much of the rise will prove temporary, reflecting stocks built in anticipation of possible Year 2000 computer failures.
Next month the economy, which has been growing without interruption since April 1991, is expected to break the longevity record for a business expansion set in the 1960's.
One of the few sectors not suffering some strain is American industry, where output grew 2.2 percent last year, mostly in technology equipment.
Output rose 0.4 percent in December, with plants operating at 81.3 percent of capacity, below the historic average of 82.1 percent.
Transportation climbed 0.7 percent in December and 5.4 percent for 1999, mainly reflecting the surge in fuel prices.
The three rate moves last year and the threat of more have pushed short-term interest rates up sharply.
Since last May, the yield on the Treasury's one-year bill has jumped 1.25 percentage points, to 6.10 percent.
But the yield on the 30-year bond is up far less, just 0.77 percentage point, to 6.69 percent.
The difference between the two yields is now 0.59 percentage points.

In bond market parlance, the yield curve in now nearly flat -- and there are some analysts who think that it will actually invert.
That means short-term interest rates would be higher than long-term ones.
So how does this help nervous bond investors?
It gives them a place to hide out without paying a big price.
There is almost no penalty now for buying less-risky short-term Treasury securities.
And that makes it easier to survive a continued sell-off in the bond market if long-term interest rates rise to to 7 percent or higher, as some analysts predict.
With rates rising, investors can lose on two counts.
First, the bonds they own are paying lower interest rates than the new ones issued as rates rise, essentially an opportunity cost.
Second, since new bonds offer higher rates, the prices of their old bonds decline, leaving them with a capital loss if they have to sell their bonds.

If investors have to sell, or if their money is in a bond fund that is realizing such losses, times are tough.
And the index of just long-term Treasury bonds, which are more vulnerable to rate increases, fell even more -- 10 percent.
AN investor could sit out the bond market turmoil by owning a one-year Treasury bill yielding 6.10 percent.
That yield is not far below the 6.69 percent of the 30-year bond -- and the risk of capital loss is much less.
An alternative is the six-month Treasury bill, yielding 5.66 percent.
Some analysts expect the Fed to be through raising rates by the summer; by then, the six-month bill will have matured, and money can then be shifted into longer-term notes or bonds as rates are falling, adding a capital gain to the return.
And, of course, it is relatively easy to hold a six-month bill until it matures, therefore avoiding the kind of capital loss that would be incurred by selling a higher-yielding but longer-term security.
Other vehicles to consider are money market funds.
Laurie White, a managing director at Wells Capital Management, says they are better than Treasury bills because an investor can get higher yields in the fund as market rates rise; the Treasury bill rate doesn't change.
One such fund, Wells Fargo Cash Investment, has a current yield of 5.72 percent.
But investors with money in a bond fund would be hit with capital losses as prices of bonds fell with an increase in interest rates.
In a money market fund, Ms. White said, ''you do avoid the losses when rates rise, especially when you compare the stable net asset value of a money market fund to the variable net asset value of a bond fund.''

For Douglas R. Cliggott, the United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, the short end of the yield curve is a good place for the time being, for both bond and stock investors.
''We are telling people to get out of stocks and bonds,'' he said.
''We think you are going to get a 7 percent long-bond yield.
And we would rather have people buy Treasury bills and sit and watch.''
So, for the near term, cash looks good.

Mr. Barak gamely called the protracted cabinet discussion ''a legitimate and democratic debate between differing economic perspectives.''
Having received the required cabinet endorsement, Mr. Klein is to be sworn in on Monday by President Ezer Weizman to a five-year term.
Mr. Barak's nomination of Mr. Klein for the bank governorship signaled a continuing commitment to strict anti-inflation policies at a time when inflation here has fallen to its lowest level in a generation.
In contrast, the base lending rate fixed by the central bank is a stiff 10.7 percent.
Maintaining high real interest rates of 9 percent or more is defended by economists who share the bank's fears of resurgent inflation, but assailed by industrialists and politicians who blame the bank's polices for three consecutive years of flat or lower per-capita incomes.
''This is not a defeat for anyone,'' Mr. Lagos said.

Mr. Lagos will be inaugurated in March as the first Socialist president of Chile since Dr. Allende was overthrown in the violent coup in 1973 led by General Pinochet and backed by the United States.
His presidency will almost certainly be very different from Dr. Allende's.
In part that is because he will be governing in a coalition with the more conservative Christian Democratic Party; Dr. Allende's coalition included the Communist Party.
But Mr. Lagos has long been a Western European-style social democrat, even through the 1970's and 1980's when other leaders of his party embraced Marxism and the Cuban revolution.
To some extent his moderation is grounded in the Keynesian lessons he learned while earning a doctorate in economics from Duke University in the 1960's.
But it is also seems to be a product of his sober personality and what his friends characterize as a distaste for impulsiveness.
Before going to the United States for graduate studies in economics, he earned a law degree at the University of Chile.
He is a weekend gardener, an avid reader of histories and loves Brahms and Mozart.
Unlike so many Chileans, he does not smoke.
But he does like to take a siesta whenever possible.
Since 1971 he has been married to Luisa Duran de la Fuente, with whom he has a daughter.
He also has two children from an earlier marriage.
He plays tennis and does light rock-climbing for exercise, but his ample waistline suggests that he is not a fanatic of either.
And when he talks of politics, compromise and consensus appear to be uppermost on his mind.
''What is our goal now?''
''Without affecting investment, savings and growth, we need to produce a society a little more just with less of a gap in the inequality of opportunity.''

The Federal Reserve said today that it had dropped its practice of adopting a policy bias toward raising or reducing interest rates, and that from now on it would signal its assessment of inflation risks through a formulaic public statement after each meeting.
Disclosing the bias was initially seen by the Fed as a way of transmitting to the financial markets its short- to medium-term outlook for the economy, and therefore reducing the risk that any change in monetary policy would destabilize the markets.
But in a number of cases last year, financial markets read too much into the announcements, sending stock and bond prices gyrating on the assumption that the Fed's policy stance implied a preordained outcome to the central bank's next policy-setting meeting.
As the problems became evident, Fed officials said last year that they would study how the disclosure policy -- adopted initially as part of a gradual effort to become less secretive -- might be changed to avoid knocking the markets off balance.

The solution announced today seeks to maintain continued public disclosure of the Fed's economic outlook without suggesting that a change in policy has been all but decided.
It was developed by a working group headed by Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the Fed's vice chairman.
Under the new procedure, the Fed will make a public statement after every meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee.
Under the old procedure, the Fed was committed to making a statement only in the event of a policy change or a major shift in its economic outlook.
The public statement will contain a passage setting out the Fed's assessment of the relative likelihood that inflation will increase or that the economy will become weaker over the subsequent several months.

The statement would contain wording chosen from among three options.
If the committee views the likelihood of growing inflation pressures to be equivalent to the risk of a slowing economy, the statement will state that the risks are ''balanced with respect to prospects for both goals,'' the Fed said.
If the Fed is clearly more concerned that a strong economy might generate rising prices, the statement will state that the risks are ''weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures.''
Should the Fed be concerned mainly that the economy is slowing to a rate below its capacity for noninflationary growth, the statement would read that the risks were ''weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness,'' the central bank said in a statement.
''A committee view that the risks are unbalanced would not necessarily trigger either a current or a subsequent policy move,'' the Fed said.
''Given the inherent uncertainty about future developments, policy actions often importantly depend on the flow of new information and the committee's judgment about its implications.''
Not only will there be no mention of a formal policy bias in the public statement, but the Fed will no longer vote on such a policy formulation and will not include any bias in the document it prepares at each meeting specifying how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York should carry out monetary policy through its open- market operations.

Three factors have contributed to the reversal, experts said: the development of better anti-theft devices for higher priced cars and sport utility vehicles, a police crackdown on chop-shop ''steal men'' and ''cutters,'' and the more aggressive prosecution of those who are caught.

''These things really started coming together in the mid-1990's,'' said Inspector James C. Dean, commander of the Police Department's Auto Crime Division.
''We're seeing that we have thousands of fewer victims every year.''
For some new models, the reason for much of the decline is clear.
Unlike most cars, vehicles equipped with these devices cannot be started by jimmying open the steering column to bypass the ignition lock.
Studies by the Highway Loss Data Institute show that immobilizers have slashed theft rates for certain models by as much as 50 percent.
They are now standard in many high-end vehicles, including Jeep's Grand Cherokee line.
''Unless you have the security key or a tow truck, you're not going to move these Jeeps,'' Mr. Arreaga said.
But the vast majority of cars do not have these devices, and even those that do can simply be towed away by determined thieves.
Further, while crime data compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation show that the national auto theft rate has been dropping, it has not been falling nearly as sharply as the rate in New York.
Experts say much of the trend in New York has been spurred by applying law enforcement strategies long used against organized crime and narcotics rings to fight car-theft operations.
''What you're seeing in New York City is that dedicating local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors to this has really made a dent,'' said Marta Genovese, a lobbyist for the Automobile Club of New York.
''This has all been a part of aggressive law enforcement efforts,'' said Police Commissioner Howard Safir.

Some of the effort has been preventive, including programs that distribute windshield stickers to cooperating car owners.
The stickers allow officers to stop the cars on the road between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., or any time a young driver is behind the wheel.
Other measures stem from traditional tactics.
In the precincts, investigators have made a point since the mid-1990's of vigorously questioning every thief caught by patrol officers.
The goal has been to find those willing to implicate chop-shop owners and provide fodder for future investigations.
''What we want is for them to give up intelligence,'' said Lt. David Little of the Auto Crime Division.
In the prosecutors' offices, assistant district attorneys have moved auto-theft cases to a higher priority, allowing fewer thieves to plead guilty to lesser misdemeanor charges.
The goal, prosecutors said, is to ensure felony convictions so that repeat offenders can be sentenced to state prison.

''The experienced thief can steal two or three cars a week.
If you put one of them in jail, you may be preventing 100 or 150 thefts a year.''
In raw numbers, nowhere are the effects of these efforts more evident than in Queens, an area that crime statistics show has been almost magnetically attractive to car thieves.
Queens has an abundance of open parking lots near shopping malls, high-rises and hospitals, and it is sprinkled with day lots where commuters board trains for Manhattan and leave their cars unattended all day.
Further, more cars are registered in Queens County than anywhere else in the state -- 675,897 in 1998, according to the State Department of Motor Vehicles.
By forming special anti-theft units and bringing racketeering charges against larger enterprises, auto thefts in the borough fell from more than 50,000 in 1990 to 14,000 last year.

The decline has been noted by Yvonne Reddick, district manager of Community Board 12 in Jamaica, Queens, who for more than 10 years heard tales of chop-shop handiwork over the phone.
Her neighbors complained of squealing tires, missing minivans and heaps of junked parts in vacant lots.
The decline has also been noted by some insurance underwriters.
At State Farm Insurance, for instance, the mean premium for comprehensive coverage, which covers theft, has fallen 52 percent in Queens in the last three years, according to Patricia R. Floyd, a company spokeswoman.
(Because comprehensive coverage amounts to roughly one-sixth the cost of a total premium, overall rates have not fallen as much.)
Interestingly, these declines -- in theft rates and premiums -- seem to have passed with little notice on the street.
Even a casual stroll through Queens neighborhoods shows that almost every car is equipped with an anti-theft club, and many show the telltale red lights of a car alarm.
Many drivers seem incredulous when told that auto theft is less common.
7 line in Flushing.
''I think it's still bad,'' she said.
The police say they understand this sentiment.
When people lose their cars, they lose money and time, as well as all manner of belongings upon which a weekly routine depends -- tools, briefcases, perhaps a baby stroller or a pair of running shoes.
''Until you've seen that empty parking space where your car was, you have no idea how serious this crime is,'' said Deputy Chief Thomas Fahey, a police spokesman.
Even Ms. Reddick, who knows firsthand of the decline, remains cautious.
She keeps her 1995 black Ford Explorer behind a gate in her driveway.

These and other projects are part of the second round of the ''New Housing Opportunities'' program of the Housing Development Corporation, a state-chartered public benefit corporation that provides bond financing for multifamily housing.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The program combines bond financing with the added nudge of a ''shallow'' subsidy per apartment.
The amount varies with the project and the location, but it has so far averaged $21,700 per apartment.
The developments also gets the benefit of the city's 421a program, which provides property tax abatements for as long as 25 years.
With the new round the program is now at 1,830 apartments in 25 projects, for a total of $185.6 million in first-mortgage financing at interest rates about a percentage point below conventional rates.
The subsidy that the Housing Development Corporation provides has totaled $39.7 million so far.
The subsidy takes the form of a second mortgage, typically at 1 percent interest.
These are modest numbers in relation to the public investment in the production of middle-income housing in the past under the Mitchell-Lama program, which produced thousands of rental and co-op apartments across the state from the 1960's through the mid-1980's.
But they are significant in showing a revival in the use of public funds to induce new multifamily rental housing for moderate-income people.
The beneficiaries are typically households with annual incomes ranging from $30,000 to $70,000.
W E could not have started construction without this program because the rents we can get in Fresh Meadows aren't high enough to support a conventional loan,'' said Mr. Marx, the Queens developer.
With conventional financing, he said, ''I would need to get about $25 a square foot'' -- about $1,800 a month for a 650-square-foot one-bedroom.
Under the New Housing Opportunities Program, builders may normally charge up to $850 a month for a studio apartment, $1,200 for a one-bedroom, $1,550 for a two-bedroom and $1,750 for a three-bedroom.
Income limits for renters are established in a manner similar to the Mitchell-Lama program: Household earnings may be as high as seven times the annual rent in families of one or two, or eight times the annual rent for three or more family members.
Most potential tenants earn well below the maximum limits.
As the program has progressed, H.D.C.
officials say, building costs have increased, obliging the agency to raise the maximum subsidy per apartment allowable under the program.
The maximum allowable subsidy per unit (normally taking the form of a very-low-interest loan) was $20,000 a unit when the program started; it now has been raised to $40,000 a unit.

Russell A. Harding, president of the Housing Development Corporation, said that by increasing the allowable subsidy, the program had ''adapted nicely'' to a rise in interest rates and construction costs, which is what has allowed it to carry on.
Perhaps the most unusual of the housing designs that the program has generated so far is Ms. Fogliano's 135-unit full-block development in the north Bronx, on land bounded by Tillotson, Palmer and Given Avenues near Interstate 95.
Apartments are entered from internal walkways on all four levels; there are two major entrances from the street, one of which takes vehicles headed for the 71-car underground garage.
Her father, Sabino Fogliano, headed Sabin Construction Company for 35 years, phasing out the business in the 80's.

Mr. Fogliano assembled the Baychester site, and his daughter spent two years seeking a zoning variance to make development feasible.
Because of the design, apartments are unusually large, and they are floor-throughs since there are no public central halls in the development.
The apartment flooring is also unusual, a concrete plank with a vinyl surface that has the appearance of grainy wood.
About 50 of the apartments have been taken at rents of $775 a month for one-bedrooms, $1,000 to $1,050 for two-bedrooms and $1,245 to $1,325 for three-bedrooms, Ms. Fogliano said.
Occupancy begins next month.
The Fresh Meadows project by Mr. Marx is the first phase of a three-building plan he has for five acres of vacant land between 72nd and 71st Avenues off Parsons Boulevard.
He is acting as the developer of a seven-story 200-unit assisted-living building, as well as a 200-bed nursing home.
His mother, Frances Marx, will be the licensed operator of the assisted-living facility.
The operating partners of the nursing home are Simon Pelman, Benjamin Landa and Benjamin Philipson.
At the apartment house, half the apartments will be one-bedrooms, renting at about $1,000 a month, and the rest will be two-bedrooms renting for about $1,300 a month.
There will also be 20,000 square feet of medical space.
Occupancy is expected in the early spring of next year.
Many of the new projects are reconstructions of older nonresidential structures as housing.
The rehabilitations are eligible for the city's J-51 tax abatement.
Among the conversions that have been financed in the second round are Bronx buildings at 597 Grand Avenue, which will have 52 apartments; 167 Clermont Avenue, with 110 apartments, and 139 Emerson Place, 50 apartments.
The rental programs are handled by the owner, or the management company appointed by the owner.
The Housing Development Corporation provides information on how to go about applying for an apartment.

To the Editor:

Re ''The True Secrets of Fad Diets: It's Calories'' (Jan. 18): Fad diets succeed because they decrease the variety of what one can eat by eliminating some foods.
Decreased variety suppresses appetite.
Or, to put it another way, variety increases appetite.
At a time when you couldn't possibly eat another bite of turkey, you may still be tempted by a slice of apple pie.
A similar phenomenon has been observed for another appetite: the male sex drive.
It is called ''the Coolidge effect,'' after a famous (but perhaps apocryphal) anecdote about Calvin Coolidge.
On receiving the message, Mr. Coolidge asked, ''Same hen every time?''
Applied to eating, the Coolidge effect explains not only the success of fad diets but also the increase in obesity over the past century.
During that time there has been a tremendous increase in the variety of foods available.
Children whose diets consist of the same few foods every day will stop eating when their nutritional needs are met, but those who can select from a panoply of tempting offerings may eat more than they require.
The tongue can be turned on even when the stomach is fed up.

And then the comeback began in earnest.
The scoring chance was created by Alexandre Daigle on the forecheck.
John MacLean retrieved the loose puck and fed Kamensky in front with a centering pass from behind the goal line.
''I hit a space about seven inches wide,'' he said.
Less than seven minutes later, Knuble skated the puck out of the corner before delivering the game-winning goal.

Abortion was the first issue joined.
Even as the Republican presidential candidates are competing to assert their credentials as opponents of abortion, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley are arguing their records as defenders of abortion rights.
The Democratic candidates' positions are now identical, favoring no change in the Roe v. Wade decision and supporting a change in the law, to require Medicaid to pay for abortions for poor women.
''Your campaign shouldn't go around saying that you've always been for a woman's right to choose, because the record shows you did not,'' Mr. Bradley said.
Mr. Gore defended himself, saying ''It's true that early in my career I wrestled with the question of what kinds of exceptions should be allowed to the general rule that Medicaid should also pay for this procedure.
I have come to the strong view that all women, regardless of their income, must have the right to choose, and that's my position.''
He added, ''If you want to manufacture a distinction, O.K.''
The vice president's first salvo came on an issue Mr. Bradley has tried to make his signature, a pledge to ''end child poverty in America.''
Mr. Gore said, ''The '81 budget cuts that Ronald Reagan proposed resulted in an increase of one million children losing health care under Medicaid and one and a half million children living in poverty.
We succeeded in doing that.

Mr. Bradley fired back by asking ''why you think it's working so well when because of welfare reform there are one million children in this country who don't have health insurance.''
As they have throughout the campaign, they quarreled about each other's health care proposals.
Mr. Gore said his plan would ''get to universal health care for all Americans in a step-by-step way.''
Mr. Bradley replied, ''You've said again tonight you're for universal health care.
The problem is you don't get anywhere close to getting there.
You nibble around the edges and indeed you have nothing in your budget for the next ten years to get the universal health insurance.''
''People here in New Hampshire would really be left out in the cold,'' he said.
But the policy arguments were sedate in comparison with the personal exchanges, with Mr. Bradley comparing the vice president to Richard Nixon.
Mr. Gore accused him of negative campaigning and said, ''If you're going to talk about a higher standard, live by it.''
Mr. Bradley said, ''When Al accuses me of negative campaigning, that reminds me of the story about Richard Nixon.
They said Richard Nixon is the kind of politician who would chop down a tree, then stand on the stump and give a speech about conservation.
He asked, ''How can you be fighting for the people when you're working hand in glove with the special interests who are fighting against the people?''
The vice president replied, ''If that's not negative, I don't know what it is.
You know, I have never been afraid to stand up to the special interests.''
''I have fought for working people against every lobby that exists in Washington for 23 years now,'' Mr. Gore added.
''I have fought for the people.''
Promised to every little special interest group, attack, attack, attack every day.
That's been the nature of it.
And quite frankly, I think the people are fed up with it, but from your standpoint, nothing is changed, the lobbyists are still in charge in Washington.''
The report reinforced market expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase short-term interest rates in the coming months to slow economic expansion and keep inflation from accelerating -- thus hurting fixed income investments.
With shorter maturities down in price yesterday, the long maturity managed to hang onto the gains made over the last four days.
The long bond was benefiting from optimism among market participants that the central bank will remain vigilant about inflation.
The Treasury will buy back some longer-term debt later this year.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said bond market participants overwhelmingly expect monetary policy to be tightened another 25 basis points at a policy-setting meeting this Tuesday ''as the Fed continues on its pre-emptive anti-inflationary course in the face of what it considers to be excessively strong economic growth amid extremely low employment.''

Two other reports are due to be released today: the Employment Cost Index (E.C.I.)
for December and the initial estimates of real gross domestic product growth and the gross domestic product price index for the fourth quarter.
''Wage pressures have been rather modest up to this point,'' Mr. Fine said, ''but part of the reason is that we are currently in a demand-pull inflation environment as opposed to a cost-pull situation, which means that wage upticks are likely to lag, rather than lead, overall increases in inflation.
As a result many market participants will tend to put more emphasis on the expected continued strength in the broadest measure of economic growth and its price component, although the E.C.I.
will hardly be overlooked.''
The economy is expected to show a 5.2 percent annual growth rate in the final three months of 1999, according to some economists, who also expect the Employment Cost Index, which measures wages, salaries and benefits, to show an increase of 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, from 0.8 percent in the third quarter.
Elsewhere, the inversion in the Treasury yield curve has become more pronounced, as the 30-year bond continues to gain relative to the rest of the maturities as a result of the Treasury's announced buyback program.
After having its worst year on record in 1999, the long bond has earned investors 2.4 percent in the last week alone, including reinvested interest payments.
If you were to freeze random television frames from Bill Clinton's State of the Union address, you might get a dignified presidential portrait.
You might just as easily get an image with the eerie wit of a Salvador Dali painting or a Monty Python montage of floating heads: there is Vice President Al Gore's left eye, hovering spectrally over the president's shoulder; when the vice president stands, his disembodied left hand with wristwatch applauds.
The peek-a-boo appearances created the goofy impression of an eager vice president poking his head in and out of the picture as if to say, ''Is it my turn yet?''
But that is not the main reason the vice president was so distracting.
His now-you-see-him, now-you-don't appearances added a touch of surprise to a perfunctory and aging television ritual.
The network coverage was in a similar lame-duck position: rooted in the present and tentatively glancing toward a future dominated by cable and the Internet.

fed directly into Mr. Clinton's first major point, about the country's economic boom.

The networks scrambled off the air as fast as they could to let the local news in (at 11:15 after the Republican response).

Preferred shares occupy a clear niche.
They are equity shares that rank ahead of common stock in their right to receive dividends and, if the issuer fails, to share in proceeds from its liquidation.
With a preferred share of the ''cumulative'' type, dividend arrears must be paid before holders of common stock get a dime.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The dividends are usually specified when issued -- but sometimes float -- and are usually paid quarterly, unlike bonds, most of which pay interest twice a year.
That is a nice advantage.
A common issue price is $25, with most issues remaining within a handful of dollars of this or another starting point, like $50, throughout their life.
They do not come due on a fixed date, but a time is specified when the company can choose to pay them off.
Preferreds are subordinate to even the least senior bonds, however, generating dividends only after all bondholders get theirs.
And holders usually do not get to vote.
Preferred issues trade like bonds, meaning that their prices move more in response to fluctuations in interest rates than in response to what happens to the companies that issue them.
(Convertible bonds, on the other hand, trade more like stocks.)
Indeed, preferred shares are best considered as substitutes for bonds, a conservative way to raise portfolio income without going into bonds, which are subject to sharp price swings, the volatility becoming progressively greater as maturity lengthens.
Preferred shares are somewhat less sensitive to rates than bonds of the same duration because of their subordination to bonds.
''They allow us to pump up the yield in a way that we have a measure of safety,'' said William C. Newell, president of Atlantic Capital Management in Sherborn, Mass.
Investing in preferred shares is generally safe and easy, with 468 of them listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
But they are not for everyone because, except for those convertible into common stock, they are almost guaranteed not to rise much in value.

''There's no growth in them,'' Mr. Newell said.
''Absolutely not.''
If interest rates decline, the issuer will redeem the preferred shares at the specified call price plus some premium.
Most new preferred issues carry five years of protection against call.
In similar circumstances, bondholders would usually get the benefit of rising prices.
What preferreds do offer, in return for investors' sacrificing the chance for capital gains, are fat yields -- 9.19 percent, for example, for preferreds of Grand Metropolitan, which merged with Guinness, the Irish brewer, in 1997 to form Diageo.
To get as much yield in bonds, Mr. Grunfeld said, ''I've got to buy junk'' -- that is, drop below investment grade minimums.
Just a few mutual funds focus on preferreds.
But more than a half-dozen closed-end funds do, and all trade at big discounts to their net asset values.
On the other hand, individual preferred-picking can be rewarding.
''It's a reasonably inefficient market where an investor with a relatively modest amount of homework can do really well,'' said Dan Fuss, portfolio manager for the Loomis Sayles Bond fund.
Gregory K. Phelps of John Hancock Advisors manages five closed-end funds.
He particularly likes preferreds issued by oil and gas companies, utilities and telecommunications concerns, and suggests that investors may want to buy shares in the secondary market trading below par.
One pick: preferred A shares of Shaw Communications, a Canadian cable company.
They are rated just below investment grade and are not callable until Sept. 30, 2002.
The shares closed at $21.125 Friday, yielding 10 percent.
Since the markets for preferred shares tend to be thin, experts say considerable care is needed in checking prices and transaction charges before jumping in.
For all the debate over education and foreign policy experience, the central dispute of the Republican campaign has come down to taxes and the use of the projected budget surplus.
George W. Bush's proposal would return a substantial portion of the surplus to the taxpayers, while John McCain's would leave most of it to pay down the national debt and ''save'' Social Security.
Supposedly Mr. Bush's plan appeals to traditional Republicans, especially in tax-hostile New Hampshire, while Mr. McCain's recognizes both a broad public desire to pay down the debt and a general lack of interest in a tax cut.
But while Mr. McCain's approach may jibe with the national polls -- and with President Clinton's, as demonstrated in last week's State of the Union Message -- it misreads the country's real needs.
Americans' taxes should be cut for one overarching reason: to reduce the size of the federal government and stifle its propensity to spend whatever is at hand.
But middle-class Americans also need a tax cut as they struggle to raise their families.
Senator McCain rejects the comparison of his plan to President Clinton's, but both are built on the false idea that paying down the federal debt is preferable to a tax cut.
Both Senator McCain and President Clinton argue that deficits cause high interest rates and that the resulting national debt will be a burden on our children.
Now that we have surpluses as far as the eye can see, interest rates are rising.

The financial market is not concerned about government borrowing; it is concerned about inflation.
President Reagan began the long decline in interest rates by backing the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting program, even through a major recession in the early 80's.
Will the debt be a burden on our children?
Of course not.
The government's liability is an asset for the holders of its bonds: pension funds, mutual funds and individuals.
These securities will pass to our children.

But in the here and now, forgoing a tax cut is a real sacrifice for middle-class families.
In articles last summer, The New York Times detailed the difficulties that middle-class families were facing, even in these prosperous times, in meeting their many financial obligations.
Families' costs for housing and college tuition continue to rise.
Americans owe $1.3 trillion on credit cards.
Payments on the national debt are not appropriated by Congress like funds for after-school programs or adult technology centers.
The debt is paid off automatically when there is a surplus after the spending takes place.
If, as a result of spending, there is no surplus, there will be no debt reduction.
Hence the sudden enthusiasm in Washington for paying off the national debt: it is a plausible defense against a tax cut that would reduce the surplus before the spending takes place.
Are they reluctant to support a tax cut because they believe the Washington mantra that it will result in higher interest rates or burden their children?
Perhaps they have begun to realize that they are being offered a false choice -- between a tax cut and debt reduction.
In reality it is the president and Congress who should be forced, after making a tax cut, to choose between debt reduction and new spending.
The results in New Hampshire may tell us whether that message is getting through.

It was the first time the union has issued such a warning to a member state.
Austrians were shocked, and a diplomatic crisis seems inevitable.
''I find it strange if the 14 E.U.
Since it became clear last week that Mr. Haider had a chance of being in government, the European news media have been full of articles implying that Nazism is on the rise in Austria, a charge that many Austrians vigorously reject and resent.
Mr. Haider's party, which favors cutting off immigration to Austria and preventing European Union expansion because it is likely to bring more Eastern Europeans over Austria's borders, came in second in the October elections, with 27 percent of the vote.
The party has grown from 5 percent when Mr. Haider took over in 1986, but political analysts say it is not entirely because of its stance on immigation.
Instead, they say, the party's supporters are fed up with the cozy patronage relationship between the Social Democrats, in power for 30 years, and the People's Party, which has governed jointly with them for the last 13.
So Mr. Haider began negotiations with the People's Party on forming a coalition with 104 seats in the 183-seat legislature, squeezing out the Social Democrats.

Prominent Austrians seemed dumbstruck today by the European announcement.
''As an Austrian, I feel terrible.
As head of the Green Party, I can only say that we wanted to block the participation of the Freedom Party in government, but still.

Mr. Haider contends that the hostility is really panic by Social Democrats elsewhere Europe and that even Israel is reacting largely to the prospect of an ally being forced out of power.
France and Belgium face third-party challenges, while Christian Democrats in France and Germany are engulfed in scandals.
He also says his critics know almost nothing about him.

He said that ''what we want is for them to give up'' on plans to let the Freedom Party into government.
''But if they don't, then Austria will be under surveillance as no country has ever been in the European Union,'' he said.
He also used the expression, ''Europe is no longer in the 1930's,'' as other diplomats have to remind listeners that Hitler, an Austrian, came to power in Germany through the ballot box.
Mr. Vedrine was apparently making the point that Europe now has mechanisms to discipline countries in such circumstances.
But many Austrians resent the comparison, and political analysts seem startled that Europe would issue threats on the possibility that Mr. Haider would join a government.
At the moment, he is not being spoken of for a cabinet-level post.
Asked how France would react if other European countries isolated it if Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing National Front got enough votes to join a government, the French official joked that he would be happy because he would not want to be governed by Mr.
It is not easy to characterize Mr. Haider because his positions are all over the political map.
Professor van der Bellen has called him an opportunist and a ''political chameleon,'' and many Austrian analysts agree.
Imitating Newt Gingrich, he calls his platform, ''Contract With Austria.''
He is definitely opposed to more immigration, and has used the word ''over-foreignization,'' which many find redolent of Naziism.
He implies that immigrants are responsible for Austria's crime rate and ''drug problem'' (although both are negligible), for welfare fraud and for increases in tuberculosis in public schools.
His words may fall on receptive ears because Austrians are heavily taxed, and until recently, the country has had liberal asylum policies and benefits for Balkan refugees.
But he also gives voice to the frustration with the bickering and the patronage machines of the Social Democrats and the People's Party, a renamed Christian Democratic party.
Austrians are so disgusted with the two parties' failure to form a government since October that polls suggest that if new elections were held today, Mr. Haider would get 33 percent of the vote this time.
He has praised the Waffen SS as a unit of the German Army and thus deserving of the respect the military normally gets.

The measure would bar people convicted of crimes against abortion clinics from using bankruptcy protection to avoid paying civil judgments.

The banking industry has grown increasingly concerned that too many people with money are taking advantage of the bankruptcy laws and skipping out on mountains of debt.
''Despite their ability to pay, wealthier filers walk away from an estimated $3 billion per year in debt,'' said Edward L. Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
The measure imposes new income requirements on people seeking a fresh start by using the nation's debt-forgiveness laws and limits a loophole used by the wealthy to shield their homes.

Negotiators from the Senate will now meet with their counterparts from the House to reconcile competing bills.
The White House said both versions are unacceptable, calling the House version too harsh and inflexible and the tax breaks attached to the minimum-wage provision in the Senate measure unacceptable.
A spokeswoman for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in her campaign for the Senate in New York has criticized the bankruptcy legislation for being unfair to women and children, declined to comment today on the Senate's action.
Under the Senate bill, the minimum wage would increase to $6.15 from $5.15 over three years, instead of over two years as Democrats want.
Senate Democrats also object to $76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years that Republicans say would help small businesses adjust to the rising minimum wage.
The House bill does not have a minimum-wage provision.

''The amendment in the bill includes a poorly targeted tax package with tax breaks that are skewed disproportionately to upper income people,'' said a letter signed by all 45 Senate Democrats to the lawmakers who will negotiate the House-Senate compromise.

The thrust of both House and Senate bills is to make it more difficult for people to discharge their debts.
Both measures try to make debtors accept more responsibility by making it more difficult to file Chapter 7 bankruptcies, which allows consumers to discharge unsecured debts that remain after assets are liquidated.
Lawmakers aim to make Chapter 13, which requires reorganization of debt under a repayment plan, the bankruptcy of choice.
With Americans filing a record 1.4 million bankruptcies in 1998, Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, said the bill ''closes loopholes and ends unfairness in provisions that are totally being abused and making a mockery out of legitimate bankruptcy law.''
But critics of the measure, like Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said today ''the industry's cure is worse than the disease.''
Bankruptcy filings dropped by 112,000 in 1999 from 1998, Mr. Kennedy said, and the bill's provisions make it more difficult for thousands of debtors who file for bankruptcy because of corporate layoffs and downsizing because of mergers.
At issue in several days of floor debate and outside Capitol Hill today, was whether it is the banks or their customers who are responsible for the growth in bankruptcy filings.
The chairman of the Consumer Federation of America, Howard M. Metzenbaum, a former Democratic senator from Ohio, said the Senate bill ''will deny many families in financial crisis a fresh start while spurring more reckless and irresponsible lending by credit-card issuers.''
House and Senate negotiators have a tough road ahead.
There are several crucial differences between the two bills.
Both measures impose a new income requirement.
The Senate bill generally says that anyone with the ability to make at least $15,000 in payments over five years would not be able to have their debts forgiven.
Under the House bill, the threshold is $6,000 over five years.
The Senate bill is more generous than the House in shielding, or creating ''safe harbors'' for debtors who make less than the median income in their state or regions.
For Chapter 7 bankruptcy filers, the Senate puts a $100,000 cap on housing equity they can exempt from creditors' motions.
The House bill has a cap of $250,000, but allows states to opt out, an important distinction for wealthy bankruptcy filers in Texas and Florida.

Finally, the Senate bill provides new consumer protections, like the disclosures on credit cards.
The House protection is more limited and more generic.
Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, said of the bill, ''The proverbial small type that hides fees and interest costs will be converted to large font so that consumers can make informed purchases, determine the best repayment schedule and manage family expenses.''
While adopting the abortion rights amendment, senators rejected several others, including one offered by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, that would have prohibited gun makers and dealers from using bankruptcy to escape debts incurred in civil lawsuits.
Once again, as was the case with Long-Term Capital Management, the majority of bond market participants are finding themselves all in the same troubling trades.

The root of the recent trouble is the Treasury's plan to reduce its issuance of long-term debt and to buy back a good deal of the debt that is outstanding.
Worried about a shortage of Treasury debt to be traded, investors who need to own high-quality long-term government securities -- managers of pension funds and insurance company portfolios who offset their long-term obligations with assets of similar maturities -- surged into the market.
Because banks and brokerage firms typically offset the potential risk in their sizable holdings in mortgages or corporate bonds by selling government bonds they do not own, a process known as selling short, the move had punishing effects on firms' positions up and down Wall Street.
A spokesman for Lehman Brothers said, ''We're not having any problems as a result of the Treasury market moves.''

On Wednesday, the Treasury said that it would retire $17 billion of its debt in the first three months of this year.
Most of the buybacks are to be focused on debt with maturities of 10 years or more.
What traders find particularly maddening about the action in the market is that many of the trades that are causing the greatest woes are not especially speculative.
In fact, they are fairly ordinary.
It is simply that the Treasury's debt reduction plan has turned the market on its head.
Although no bank or brokerage firm came forward with reports of losses, the carnage in the market will most likely push brokerage firms and banks to reassess their heavy reliance on Treasuries to hedge their corporate bond or mortgage holdings.
The United States Treasury market is the largest and most liquid in the world, but now that this market will be shrinking, traders will look for new securities to use as hedging vehicles.

In the meantime, these traders are exiting their troubled short positions, which are sizable, buying long-term Treasuries to cover those they had sold short.
One trader said a conservative estimate of the Treasuries sold short is twice the securities available for trading, indicating that the pain in the bond market could continue for some time.
The rally in bonds has exacerbated an unusual occurrence in the market: short-term interest rates are considerably higher than those on long-term securities.
That is unusual because investors are traditionally paid more to hold long-term instruments because they are taking on more risk than those investors who buy short-term securities.
When short-term yields rise above those of long-term instruments, Wall Street traders say the yield curve is inverted.
''Whenever we have changes in the structure of the yield curve, it has taken about six months for the market to assimilate the changes,'' said Gemma Wright, senior interest rate strategist at Aubrey G. Lanston, an investment firm in New York.
''This is not going to be any different.''
That represents an annual rise of just 3.5 percent, down from an annualized increase of 3.7 percent last fall.

The economic expansion became the longest on record at 107 months, surpassing the 1960's boom.
Technology played a key role in the long run of prosperity by making businesses more efficient and workers more productive.
RICHARD W. STEVENSON
Economic expansions do not die of old age.
The current expansion, the longest in recorded history, will not end from exhaustion.
A nine-year-old expansion is no more likely to end than a two-year-old expansion.
Indeed, the term business cycle is a misnomer.
Recoveries and recessions do not occur in regular cycles.
There are ups and downs but no pattern.
This expansion, like all those that have come before, will end.
No one knows when.
But there are clues about how it will end.
Prof. John Taylor of Stanford points out that ''the start of every recession since World War II has been preceded by a run-up of inflation.''
Once inflation begins to rise, the Federal Reserve is forced to crack down, raising interest rates to slow spending and bring prices under control.
Mr. Taylor pictures the job of the Fed as a constant struggle to keep spending growing at about the same pace as the capacity of the economy to produce new goods and services.
The task is difficult because the actions the Fed takes today will not affect inflation for months if not years into the future.
That forces the Fed to anticipate the future.
When it errs, inflation can take off.
OPEC added to the problem by jacking up the price of foreign oil.
A similar story -- recovery leading to inflation leading to Fed intervention and recession -- can be told about the downturn in the late 1950's.
The remarkable feature of the current recovery is that, after almost nine years, there is still little whiff of rising inflation.
There is no need for the Fed to crack down.
The Fed has proved over the last 20 years that it recognizes its obligation to control inflation and marshal its tools appropriately.
According to Mr. Taylor's calculations, the Fed reacts today to initial bumps in inflation twice as aggressively -- measured by the size of interest-rate hikes -- as it did in the 1960's and 70's.
Yet no one thinks the Fed can keep the economy growing forever.
It will make mistakes.
It may let spending grow too quickly, and then be forced to clamp down.
Or it may keep spending from growing fast enough to keep workers fully employed, as has happened in Japan.
Beyond technical mistakes by the Fed, the economy will some day be rocked by events beyond anyone's control.
OPEC has tripled oil prices over the past year and could drive them even higher.
Another financial crisis could sweep through Asia or Latin America or both.
But such shocks in recent years have not thrown the economy into recession, in large part because the Fed reacted quickly to keep spending growing at a healthy clip.

The real danger is something unseen and as yet unknown.
But some trends are encouraging.
Recessions are getting milder.
Expansions are getting longer.
Indeed, except for a mild recession at the beginning of the 1990's, the American economy has enjoyed uninterrupted growth for almost 18 years.
The important point is that these good times have not been solely due to luck.
Although Mr. Bush resisted using the word ''hypocrite,'' he criticized Mr. McCain for making campaign finance reform the centerpiece of his campaign while accepting campaign contributions from lobbyists that have business before the Senate Commerce Committee, which Mr. McCain heads.

Citing an unnamed news report, Mr. Bush claimed that Mr. McCain had received ''more money than anybody'' from Washington lobbyists.
''On the one hand he preaches campaign finance reform on the other hand he passes the plate,'' Mr. Bush said.
Told about Mr. Bush's new approach, Mr. McCain responded: ''I guess Governor Bush is now a reformer.
If so, it's his first day on the job.''
Mr. Bush's escalating fight with Mr. McCain has also been reflected over the airwaves in South Carolina, the site of the next major Republican primary, on Feb. 19.
On Friday, Mr. Bush began running a commercial that accused Mr. McCain of distorting the governor's tax cut plan.
And today, Mr. McCain released a new advertisement accusing Mr. Bush of negative campaigning and using the harshest language of any political ad so far in this political season.
The spot ends with the line: ''Do we really want another politician in the White House America can't trust?''
That prompted a response from Mr. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, who said: ''Suggesting that Governor Bush is as dishonest as Bill Clinton is a disservice to our party and our principles.
Our nation has been through enough and John McCain's ad has gone too far.''

The campaign announced today that Mr. Bush's mother, Barbara Bush, and his father, former President George Bush, would both be back on the campaign trail this week.
The former president has one event in Michigan on Tuesday and three on Wednesday; Mrs. Bush has three appearances scheduled in Virginia on Wednesday.
''I think it's a net plus,'' one adviser said, alluding to the couple's popularity in many crucial states.
''It also helps up establish ourselves as the alternative to Clinton by reminding people: this is what you had.''
But a few Republican strategists said the Bush campaign was playing a dangerous game with its use of surrogates and its parade of endorsements by essentially making a case that voters should support Mr. Bush simply because so many others do.
''It's gotten to the point where the issue of Bush's gravitas and abilities as a candidate are the driving issues of the campaign,'' one strategist said.
''Having his parents work for him doesn't address those.''
''If you're tired of no results and simple, empty rhetoric,'' he said, ''if you're tired of people who say one thing and do another, come join our team.''
''The calculus is pretty straightforward,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers.
''As productivity accelerates, the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates becomes less and less.''

-------------------- Treasuries Rise Sharply

(By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as a government report suggested productivity gains and falling labor costs are helping hold back inflation, even with unemployment at a three-decade low.
Bonds extended gains after a Treasury note auction met with slack demand, prompting some investors to sell shorter-maturity government debt and pile into the better-performing bond, as they have been doing since late January, traders said.
The productivity and wage reports ''are really good numbers for the bond market,'' said Patrick Kennedy, who helps manage at Pitcairn Trust Company in Jenkintown, Pa.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.23 percent from 6.34 percent on Monday.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 96.505

High Yield: 6.741%

Low Yield: 6.650%

Median Yield: 6.710%

Total applied for: $25,052,043

Accepted: $14,230,043

Noncompetitive: $608,167

Interest set at: 5 7/8

The five-year notes mature Nov. 15, 2004.

A live-action IMAX 3-D film is created by shooting the scenes with a special camera with two apertures.
By positioning the apertures at approximately the distance between the human eyes, an image can be simultaneously recorded from slightly different perspectives on two separate rolls of film.
The film is then played back on a double-lensed projector that casts the image on the giant aluminum IMAX screen.
Special shutters, filters and viewing glasses let the viewer see the left and right images separately; the brain combines them to perceive the movie as three-dimensional.
Although the projection and the viewing process are identical for an animated film like ''Cyberworld,'' the 3-D aspect of the film is created in the ones and zeros of program code.
Computer-animated projects like ''Toy Story'' and ''Antz'' are created using sophisticated 3-D modeling software.
The IMAX conversion process essentially goes back into this software and shifts the point of view slightly, to create two images that are like those used in live-action 3-D. By viewing the images simultaneously through the special glasses, the 3-D magic comes to life.
For animated clips make originally by IMAX, computer artists draw the animation with a special stereo-scopic device that lets them draw digital images with a freely moving wand.
The movements are than fed into a computer and stored as 3-D images.
Making an IMAX film from scratch is time-consuming and expensive; it could cost twice as much as it would take to convert a film with computer animation into the IMAX format.
The conversion technology could even be applied to the computer-animated sections of films like ''Men in Black'' or ''Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.''
Mr. Wechsler estimated that similar technology could be used within five years to transform live-action film sequences.
If a colorized ''Casablanca'' looks bizarre, just imagine the possibilities of Bogey in 3-D.

Gentex of Zeeland, Mich., which dominates the electrochromic mirror market, has pioneered some additional technologies that have found their way into and onto the mirror and its housing.

Then another company, the Prince Corporation, now owned by Johnson Controls, invented the HomeLink transmitter, with three buttons that can learn and transmit signals that will open gates or garage doors and turn on the lights in one's house as the car approaches.
The HomeLink buttons have been relocated to the mirror housings of various luxury cars.
Mirrors and housings can also accommodate transponders for navigation systems; receivers for keyless locking signals; map lights that consist of light-emitting diodes; displays for tire pressure monitors; and readouts for trip computers.
Mr. Piersma said that eventually, mirrors could provide a place for e-mail readouts, rear-vision systems and obstacle-detection devices, among other things.

Notwithstanding the decline in many technology stocks, the market for initial public offerings remained very hot.
That is the second-fastest fall from a peak ever, Mr. Birinyi said.
Byron Wien, a strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, noted that long-term interest rates have declined since Jan. 14, even while the Dow was undergoing its correction.
Falling rates are normally good for stocks, he noted, saying that the decline was evidence that stock prices had been very high before the fall.
Since then, however, the market has become much more volatile.
Correction: February 15, 2000, Tuesday Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about the stock market misstated the change of the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond on Friday.
's more cooperative stance would not have been sufficient to save Mr. Trimble from having to resign, and thus he had no second thoughts about putting the Belfast administration on hold.
Britain believes Mr. Trimble to be key to keeping the Ulster Unionists committed to the peace arrangements, and fears that any successor to him might scuttle them.
Although the I.R.A.
assurances failed to forestall suspension of local government, they now appear to be the basis for negotiations next week.
Mr. Trimble said today that he would meet with Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, next week to seek ''clarification'' of the I.R.A.
proposal.
representative that the I.R.A.
will consider how to put arms and explosives beyond use.''
Putting arms beyond use could be a method of destroying arms or sealing off arms caches that would allow the I.R.A.
A subsequent reference in the report to ''the removal of the causes of conflict'' might mean the actual departure of the British from Northern Ireland.
Mr. Mandelson said: ''The significance of the latest report is that the I.R.A's position has shifted.
Now there are certain aspects which are unclear about the I.R.A's position, and further clarification is needed about what it amounts to.''

The two sponsors of the peace agreement, London and Dublin, and its most vigorous international booster, Washington, issued statements calling the new I.R.A.
stance constructive.
There also was no hint that the paramilitary cease-fires, now in their third year, might end.

Unionists, mostly Protestants, want to see the province remain part of Britain, while Republicans, who tend to be Catholics, want better ties with Dublin and eventual union with Ireland.
In the small increments by which advances are measured in Northern Ireland, it appears significant that Mr. Trimble and Mr. Adams go into this stage with a personal association and direct communication they lacked the last time progress stalled last summer.
Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, once an I.R.A.
fighter, was pictured in papers every day in a business suit behind his minister's desk at the education department, or chatting up schoolchildren like any other parochial politician.
Sir Brian Mawhinney, the Belfast-born spokesman for the former Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major, told the House of Commons in London this week of his changing view of Mr. Adams: ''I surprise myself slightly by saying I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.
I believe that he does want change in a peaceful, democratic direction.''
The changing attitudes have fed a consensus that Sinn Fein's failure to get the I.R.A.
The mystery over the exact relationship between the I.R.A.
and Sinn Fein, its political ally, continues, but it seems clear that Mr. Adams cannot get just anything he wants from the paramilitary commanders.
The peace talk sponsors and participants have for years repeatedly wrapped the vexing issue of weapons turnovers in ambiguous language or parked it on the sidelines with independent international commissions.
Even the word used for disarmament -- decommissioning -- sounds more like the shuffling of papers than the surrender of guns, but that did not take the sting out of the issue.
''You would come in one day a week, drop off the material.
You would start making rounds.''
The magazine paid per square inch of published work, and cartoonists often drew big, hoping for more money.
(Now it's a flat payment: $1,200 for a cartoon and $4,000 for the first cover and an additional $500 for each successive one in the same year.)
''At the end of the day,'' Mr. Lorenz said, ''you'd go to '1,000 Jokes,' published by Dell, and the editor would sop up whatever was left.''
''For lunch we'd go to the Blue Ribbon or the Lobster,'' Mr. Koren said.
Mr. Stevenson, a writer and cartoonist known for his loose drawings of the perplexed middle class, remembers his start.

To avoid awkward encounters with expectant artists and writers, Ross kept building more walls.
George Booth, who started drawing his mad bull-terriers and psychotic cats for The New Yorker in the 1970's, has done some historical research: ''At one point a mirror was hung up in the hallway so you could see who was coming in and not run into him.
I heard someone coming down the hall'' toward a steep stairway.
He was practically blind and not opposed to having more drink than he should.
If I let a million-dollar talent kill himself falling down the stairway, what would happen to me?''
''We lost Daddy.''
The betrayal was not only personal but aesthetic, or so many of the old cartoonists think.

Arnie Levin, the cartoonist of loopy lines, said, ''There would be 40 artists piling up on the same topic.''
And the effect?
The cartoons are ''not quite as philosophically pointed as they used to be,'' and ''the drawing has diminished,'' Mr. Koren said.
Mr. Modell said, ''There's no heart there, and you can feel the effort of the artist, how he has his hand on the pulse of the world.''
But not everyone agrees.

''When people look back, they say cartoons aren't as funny today,'' said Ms. Chast, who specializes in drawing homely types with odd domestic obsessions.
''But if you pick up any issue from any year, maybe two or three cartoons are complete side splitters, and two or three completely miss the boat, and the rest will be O.K., funny but not sublime.''
Ms. Chast was once accused of drawing badly.
And there were letters from people canceling their subscriptions.
But now almost every New Yorker artist reveres her.
Ms. Chast knows that there's ''less emphasis on the craft of drawing,'' she said, but she does not think that means standards have disappeared.
''I like a drawing not to repel me.''
But now, both inside and outside The New Yorker, many cartoonists are striving for a certain arty repulsiveness.
''There's a whole generation of younger cartoonists inspired by R. Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Bill Griffith and Harvey Kurtzman,'' Jules Feiffer said.
With traces of underground styles reaching The New Yorker, some of the old cartoonists have found themselves out of work.
Now I'm like an old mule who still goes to the pump.
If I have an idea, I have to get rid of it, so I'll fax it to The New Yorker, then Playboy.''
But lately, he said, he has sold nothing.
Mr. Booth is more philosophical: ''I haven't done any covers since the 1980's.
But things go in cycles, and you just pull your skivvies up around your armpits and go on.''
Cartoons, Mr. Modell noted, are there to defuse readers' anxieties about encountering ''great slabs of type,'' the way clowns defuse the intensity of the high-wire act.
''But now,'' he added, ''there's so much cacophony -- photos, ads -- that there's no need for cartoonists.
If I ran the magazine, I wouldn't have them.''
There are some people who don't lament the lost New Yorker.
Not surprisingly, they are the ones who made their reputations elsewhere.
Surprisingly, they are among the few who actually live in New York.

''I was not a reader of The New Yorker, and I didn't have the ambition to be a New Yorker cartoonist,'' said David Levine, who is best known for his pen-and-ink caricatures in The New York Review of Books but now does pencil caricatures for The New Yorker.
''I'm not a gag cartoonist.
She was fighting for a losing magazine.
Mr. Feiffer, who is known for his squiggly, talking-head cartoons in The Village Voice, has a similar story.
I grew up loving comic strips.''
And what he calls his ''abrasive social and political commentary'' was far from The New Yorker's ideal.
So under a host of pressures the old cartoon culture has crumbled.
Few cartoonists go into the city regularly.
Many have families and other jobs: as animators, artists and authors.
Mr. Koren said: ''The collegiality has evaporated.''
Now it wants celebrities to make The New Yorker.''
Even drawing itself may be in decline.
''Kids don't draw anymore,'' Mr. Sorel said.
''Comic art in America started at the turn of the century, and it's ending at the turn of another century.
There is no longer a New Yorker style.
Anything goes.
A New Yorker cartoon is anything the editor says it is.''
Mr. Modell takes a simpler view of the new New Yorker: ''I could be a great admirer if they would buy my cartoons.''
I don't want to go whole hog here, but Nueske's struck me as the beluga of bacon, the Rolls-Royce of rashers.
It makes a memorable B.L.T., one of the supreme inventions of American short-order cookery, and its crunchiness provides an ideal counterpoint to the richness of calf's liver or shad roe.
It was invented, or might have been, for breakfast bacon and eggs, which my wife, Betsey, allows me (and herself) a morning or two a month.
It is one of those food products, I have discovered, that is known to and cherished by chefs across the country, if not to most home cooks -- a product of a fine rural smokehouse, a modern place using old-fashioned methods that turns out bacon worth throwing caution to the winds for, at least once in a while.

This is bacon that cries out, now that I think of it, for a revival of those half-forgotten comfort foods of the 1950's like cheese dreams (open-faced grilled cheese sandwiches with slices of tomato and crisscrossed bacon slices on top) and traditional English savories like angels on horseback (oysters wrapped in strips of bacon, skewered with toothpicks and then broiled) or devils on horseback (in which the oysters are supplanted by pitted prunes).
There are other high-quality American bacons on the market, smoked with hickory or corncobs, flavored with red pepper or molasses or even cinnamon.
Some are sweeter, some saltier.
They come from the Ozarks, from New England and from the upper South -- mainly Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
An enterprising California mail-order operative named Dan Philips has started a Bacon of the Month Club: a pound or so of a different bacon each month for $140 a year (through the Grateful Palate, 888-472-5283, or on the Web at www.gratefulpalate.com).
None of them, rest assured, bear any resemblance to the wan, watery product that dominates the supermarket shelves.
WHEN I bring home the bacon these days, it's usually Nueske's, so I thought I'd better try to find out why it tastes the way it does.
Two Nueske brothers, Robert D., 52, and James A., 50, run the place.
Like all the other immigrants hereabouts, they brought spicing and curing formulas with them, and quickly built a smokehouse.
Hillcrest Farm raises no pigs of its own.
This is dairy country.
Instead, it buys pork bellies, the fatty flaps that lie across the pig's ribs, from hogs raised to its specifications in Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and Canada.
But not in Wisconsin.
The hogs whose bellies are bound for Nueske are fed a larger-than-normal percentage of barley, along with corn, and are slaughtered at certain weights, Mr. Nueske explained, to minimize fattiness without destroying the taste.
The brine in which the bellies are soaked is simple -- sugar, as little salt as possible and several sodium compounds, among them sodium nitrite, which are included as preservatives and flavorings.
Sodium nitrite content is regulated by the Agriculture Department, and Nueske bacon contains only 4 percent of the permitted maximum.
It could be eliminated altogether, which might be marginally healthier, but nitrites provide some of the characteristic bacon flavor, and the only nitrite-free bacon I have sampled tasted more like roast pork.

The slabs of bacon spend about 24 hours in the brine, as much as 1,800 pounds to each yellow plastic vat.
But the key to the flavor and consistency of Nueske bacon, unlike some country bacons, which are cured with dry rubs, lies in the smokehouse and not in the curing tanks.

Most bacon is smoked in stainless-steel machines, fired with sawdust, that do the job in four to six hours; Nueske uses 16 steel-lined concrete-block smokehouses, heated by open fires of applewood logs, and keeps the meat over the coals 20 to 24 hours.
The bacon goes in on special racks fitted with wheels, 80 sides at a time, about 16,000 pounds a day.
It emerges lean and cordovan-colored, ready to be hand-trimmed and then machine-sliced, roughly 18 one-eighth-inch slices to a pound.
''For that, and for maximum flavor, you have to finish at very high temperatures.''
A pound of most run-of-the-mill raw bacon produces as little as a quarter to a third of a pound of cooked bacon; Nueske shoots for about three-quarters of a pound, he said.
WHILE bacon consumption in restaurants is rising, consumption in American homes is still dropping.
Households that use it treat it as restaurants do, more as a taste-enhancing ingredient than as an everyday breakfast meat.
Jim Nueske is no exception.
''I think mostly Kellogg's in the morning,'' he said.
''Bacon and eggs we save mostly for the weekends.''
The boom in bacon sales has come from its use in sandwiches, salads, soups, pasta dishes and the like, which put a premium, of course, on flavor.
That has opened a lot of doors for Mr. Nueske, starting with grocers and restaurateurs in Milwaukee and Minneapolis in the late 1970's.
''I'm selling a flavoring, not bacon as such,'' he told me.
''That's my sales technique.
I drop a pound of bacon off, ask the guy to try it.
I don't mention price -- half the time I don't know the current price -- and tell them I'll be back to check with them in a week.
Then I have them.''
''I'm going to give you an opportunity to fail,'' their cheerful banker told them.

Now, from this little town of 1,140 people, Nueske bacon is shipped to restaurants like the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, Balthazar and An American Place in New York, Commander's Palace in New Orleans, Clio and Olives in Boston, and Pinot in Los Angeles.
It goes into everything from quiche Lorraine to wine-based sauces for eggs and poultry.
Availability through retail channels is spotty, and in the New York area, so far nonexistent.
But direct-mail shipments, based until three years ago in a garage, have taken off, and Nueske is now sending out a million catalogs four times a year.
Available either in standard slices, 18 to a pound, or thin-sliced, 24 to a pound, bacon costs $19.95 for two pounds, or $20.95 coated with cracked pepper.
(Orders can be placed by calling a 24-hour number, 800-392-2266, or at www.nueske.com.)
It's a far cry from the old days.
''There's this woman who's worked for us for years,'' Mr. Nueske said over a lunchtime B.L.T.
at Al & Mary's cafe at Wittenberg's main (and only) crossroads.
''She's 85 now, still going strong.
They'd let us put some bacon in their soft-drinks cooler, and when people ordered a B.L.T.
or a bacon cheeseburger and asked where they could get that bacon, why, they'd just point across the room.
''Now, people order the stuff from Japan and Russia and we have 120 people working for us.
Who would have thought bacon could do that?''
Finally, corporations will probably issue more debt to fill the public demand for bonds, creating a debt burden that could make it much more difficult for the nation to shake off a downturn in the economy.

''The surplus has forced the Treasury to change the way they do business, and we are looking at the consequences,'' said Ward McCarthy, principal at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. ''It affects everybody.''
Because the market for Treasury debt is the largest and most heavily traded in the world, and because investors evaluate almost every other type of bond using a Treasury security as a benchmark, even the smallest change in the government's financing has effects at home and abroad.
''One of the reasons the U.S. has been the dominant factor in the world is we were the only place with a deep, liquid debt market,'' said Stan Jonas, managing director at FIMAT U.S.A., a brokerage firm in New York.
Now that market is disappearing.''
The ripples from a vanishing public market for Treasury debt have begun to hit investors who buy bonds and the companies that issue them.
There was a mad rush for long-term government bonds, driving down interest rates on long-term government debt even as the Federal Reserve Board was raising short-term rates to try to cool down an overheated economy.
Normally, investors are given extra incentive in the form of higher rates to lock up their money for a longer period.
More important, economists and market strategists say, the Treasury's plan and the ensuing rush to long-term bonds are throwing sand into the gears that the Fed uses to keep the economy perking while protecting against inflation.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who is scheduled to testify today as part of his twice-a-year report to Congress, has raised short-term rates three times since last June in an effort to slow the economy.
But rates on long-term Treasury securities have fallen.
''It poses a little bit of a challenge for monetary policy,'' said Henry Kaufman, the noted Wall Street economist.

Few economists say the Treasury's overall plan to reduce the nation's debt is wrongheaded.
As long as the economy and stock markets remain hot and Congress keeps a lid on spending, budget surpluses will continue.
Reducing debt, the government argues, is a natural use for these funds.
To be sure, the government will still issue debt to be held by the Federal Reserve and the Social Security trust.
It is the publicly held debt that is set for extinction.

Although the Treasury securities market is the world's largest and most influential, it wasn't always thus.
By fiscal 1998, according to the Treasury, federal debt held by the public had risen to $3.7 trillion, up from $2.1 trillion just 10 years earlier.
But the days of ballooning Treasury debt are over.
Eliminating the publicly held Treasury debt by 2013, Mr. Summers said, will put downward pressure on all interest rates, helping to reduce consumer payments on home mortgages, car loans and other forms of credit.
This has not happened yet.
Most consumer borrowings are based upon shorter-term interest rates -- even 30-year mortgage rates are based on shorter-term rates because homeowners typically pay off their loans well before their term is up -- and these are rising because of the Fed's recent actions.
Where the effects have been felt sharply are in the corporate bond and mortgage markets.
A 30-year corporate bond is usually judged against a 30-year Treasury.
But with Treasuries being hoarded ahead of a possible shortage, the rates on the bonds no longer represent a good comparison.
As a result, the private debt market has lost its anchor.
Wall Street will undoubtedly create a new security to use as a benchmark for bond issues soon.
But until then, uncertainty will rule the market.
As a result, investors are having trouble assessing new bond issues and are acting with caution.
''I think everybody has thrown up their hands at the moment,'' said Carol Levenson, editor of Gimme Credit, a research service that analyzes high-grade corporate bonds.
''The market is waiting to see if things are going to return to normal.''

Trading has also dropped off recently in the vast market for mortgage obligations, which are backed by consumer loans, according to Mickey Levy, the chief economist at BankAmerica.
''With higher risk in this market, it could make rates higher on the margin,'' he said, for the moment, just the opposite of what Mr. Summers has predicted.
Some strategists suspect that the bond market may never return to normal.
''One byproduct of a consequential shrinkage of the Treasury market is that the U.S. debt markets will be increasingly comprised of a variety of securities that are riskier than Treasury debt,'' Mr. McCarthy said.
''So in addition to increased volatility, we are dealing with almost by definition a riskier bond market as well.''
This is quite a change, given that much of the bond market has been a refuge for investors seeking safety and security in their holdings.
Few are confident that investors have recognized the increased risks they will need to take when they invest in bonds as the Treasury bows out of the market and corporate issuers take its place.
Moreover, investors may not recognize the implications of a big increase in corporate debt when the nation experiences a recession.
''When you go into an economic slowdown and there is a large amount of government debt outstanding and a small amount of corporate debt outstanding, that's not a problem,'' Mr. Kaufman explained.
''All you need is an easing in monetary policy and off we go again.
But when the private sector is heavily burdened when we slow down, that will require more stimulation.
This is a concern.''
One economist worried that using the budget surplus to finance a buyback of existing Treasury debt could cause inflation.
Robert H. Parks, a professor of finance at the Lubin Graduate School of Business at Pace University, said: ''This increases the money supply, and it also increases the reserves of private financial institutions.
It is highly expansionary and potentially inflationary in an economy that is roaring ahead.''
Correction: February 18, 2000, Friday The Market Place column yesterday, about reducing the nation's debt, misstated the number of times the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates since June.
It is four, not three.
When Alan Greenspan speaks, the Old Economy trembles.
But the new one thinks it is impervious to higher interest rates, and shrugs off warnings from the Federal Reserve chairman.
Mr. Greenspan's stark warnings that short-term interest rates would continue to rise had only a brief effect on the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by high-technology companies that are benefiting from the digital revolution.
The index is up 69 percent since June 30, the date of the first of the Fed's four rate increases.
But the story was different for the Dow Jones industrial average, which is far more dependent on stocks that are liable to be hurt as higher interest rates slow the economy.
It is down about 4 percent since June 30.
''Maybe he's raised his own estimate'' of how high interest rates have to go to slow the economy, said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney.
For some time the fixed-income markets have been expecting at least two more increases in short-term rates by the Fed, with the first one, of at least a quarter percentage point, expected next month.
''The chairman's comments did not trigger any massive re-evaluation of where the Fed is going,'' said Louis Crandall, the chief economist of Wrightson Associates, a bond market research firm.
''If anything, it may have made people a little more nervous'' that the next increase might be a half percentage point, rather than the quarter-point raise seen in the previous increases.

Short-term interest rates rose moderately yesterday, though it is unclear how much of that was caused by Mr. Greenspan's remarks and how much by other factors, including a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that indicated rising price pressures for manufacturing companies.
''To date, rising business earnings expectations and declining compensation for risk have more than offset'' the effect of higher rates, he said.
But he forecast that, at some point, rates would rise enough to have an effect on the expectations of stock market investors.
''Greenspan seems dead-set on taking the punch bowl from the party,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
''The market is understanding that interest rates will continue to head higher.''
Stocks, though, do not stop going up just because interest rates rise.
They stop going up because investors stop bidding them up.
So far, it appears, higher interest rates have alarmed investors in many industries.
Technology stock investors are not worried about higher interest rates, and yesterday's forceful testimony from Mr. Greenspan did not change that.
DOLLAR UP.
AMERICA'S nine-year economic expansion is now the longest in history.
Companies everywhere are thriving and sharing this prosperity with workers clamoring for raises.
So paychecks must be ballooning, right?
Not exactly.
Pay should be climbing faster and faster as the unemployment rate falls and companies raise wages to lure new workers or to retain the ones they have.
But wage increases, instead of getting bigger, are getting smaller.
What a puzzle that is for policy makers.
Anticipating faster wage increases, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest rates to slow the economy, a strategy that will continue, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, suggested in Congressional testimony last week.
A slower economy, the thinking goes, reduces the demand for workers, taking pressure off employers to raise wages.
Less pressure to lift wages means less pressure to raise prices to cover the higher labor costs.
A major source of inflation is thus contained.
Strangely, though, wage growth is slowing even without higher interest rates.
But now all the numbers for 1999 are in hand, and there is no mistake.
''It is a mystery,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys.
''The usual preconditions for wage pressure have existed for some time, but the behavior that we expected, based on behavior in the past, particularly in the 1960's, has not been forthcoming.''
That happened whether the pay was for flipping hamburgers or designing machines and whether the measure was wages or a broader category that also includes bonuses and cashed-in stock options.
Only people earning north of $65,000 -- fewer than 10 percent of all workers -- found their incomes growing faster last year after adjustment for inflation.
Caught off guard, economists are reaching for explanations.
High on the list is job insecurity.
Despite rising public confidence in the economy, many workers still remember the layoffs and downsizings of the early 1990's.
Employees have settled on annual raises of about 3 percent in the last few years.
Demographics may play a role, some economists say.
The work force is aging as baby-boomers move into their 50's and older workers are not as aggressive about raises.
''If you are turned down, you are not going to get another job so easily,'' said James Glassman, an economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
THEN there is the job-mix thesis.
Manufacturers have shed 350,000 jobs in the past two years, and lower-paying service jobs have replaced them.
The 1996 minimum wage law also played a role, helping to push up wages at the low end in 1997 and 1998, says Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton labor economist.
And immigrants flooding into the work force have also held back wages.
Finally, business itself has become more reluctant to raise wages, invoking global competition as a reason and demonstrating a readiness to move operations to lower-wage regions in the United States or abroad.
Still, many economists insist that wage pressure will increase soon.
''We definitely expect hourly compensation to pick up this year,'' said Kenneth J. Matheny, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers.
The Clinton administration, under pressure from Congress and angry consumers in New England, has sent the energy secretary to petition Middle East ministers, who are about to hold important strategy talks, to release more oil.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The administration also is debating whether and how to intervene in the market and push prices down, perhaps by allowing oil companies to borrow from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a stockpile generally intended for use only in emergencies like an embargo or a war.
The oil price spike has also registered at the Federal Reserve.
Core inflation remains remarkably subdued, running last month at just 1.9 percent.
When energy costs are factored in, however, inflation expanded at a rate of 2.7 percent, meaning that oil costs alone pushed inflation eight-tenths of a percentage point higher than it would otherwise have been.
With the Fed already nervous about the bubbly stock market and a shortage of workers, higher oil prices seem likely to reinforce the tendency toward raising interest rates to cool the economy.
''In the macro sense, oil prices do not endanger the economy the way they once did,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who is currently touring six oil-producing nations.
''But we cannot ignore the potential for oil to have an impact on inflation.
What OPEC does matters.''
Oil suddenly re-emerged as an economic and political threat mainly because of things happening abroad.
The main one is oil-hungry Asia.
The sharp recession in Asian economies beginning in 1997 brought about a collapse of oil prices.
Their speedy recovery recently has created hefty demand and contributed a great deal to the price surge.
At the same time, oil-producing nations, their solidarity in tatters as recently as 1997, have engineered a period of strategic harmony unseen since the Arab oil embargo of 1973.
Not unlike in the 1970's, experts these days deconstruct every public statement by world oil ministers for hints that more oil will start flowing soon.
Economists and OPEC watchers are split on whether the oil problem will persist.
Many believe prices have peaked, with oil ministers already sending signals that they intend to increase production.
If that proves true, then today's high oil prices will probably be seen as nothing more than a temporary disturbance.
The conventional wisdom about oil will seem truer than ever.
But there is also a much less rosy outlook that sees oil supplies remaining tight for a couple years, until non-OPEC producers respond by drilling for new oil.
Prices would hold at current levels or even jump higher.
That would fuel inflation and repeated interest rate increases by the Fed.
In the worst case, higher interest rates would push the economy into recession.

In that event, oil, having helped prompt downturns in the early 1970's, the early 1980's and the early 1990's, would once again become the bete noire of the American economy.
''People have just started to wake up,'' said Philip K. Verleger, who monitors the oil industry for the Cambridge, Mass.-based Brattle Group.
He sees oil prices rising to at least $33 a barrel by year-end if oil exporters increase production, closer to $40 a barrel if they do not.
''We have a serious problem now and it could get worse.''
The outcome will depend in part on a series of meetings among oil producing countries beginning late this month and ending with OPEC's semiannual strategy session in Vienna on March 27.
By that time, Clinton administration officials said, it should be clear whether oil producers are willing to sacrifice windfall oil profits to help keep economic growth on track in the United States, Europe and East Asia, powerful economies that import most of their oil.
Oil ministers in Saudi Arabia and Mexico, balancing their own profits against a desire to keep Western economies strong and defend oil's share of energy production worldwide, have both said that they consider a price range of $20 to $25 a barrel more appropriate than $30 a barrel.
But administration officials are pressing for details of how they intend to get there.

He will also see Saudi, Kuwaiti and Norwegian ministers in coming days.
Though United States officials seem optimistic that the March meetings will lead to at least some increased output, the question is how much.
With oil inventories at record lows relative to demand, the International Energy Agency estimates that OPEC would need to increase output by nearly 10 percent just to keep pace with world demand.
Administration officials say oil producers are debating increases of 1.2 million to 3.1 million barrels a day, or 4.5 percent to 12 percent from production last month.
Only increases at the high end of that range would alleviate the squeeze, they say.
Even then, relief may not arrive in time for the summer driving season.
It takes at least six weeks for fresh production in the Middle East to pass through refineries and reach neighborhood gas stations.
Some analysts believe that gas could hit an all-time high of $2 a gallon this summer, though forecasting oil prices is as much soothsaying as science.
The broader question is how long oil-producing nations will hang together.
For years, OPEC looked more like a bazaar than a cartel, with nonstop haggling and rampant cheating undercutting public pledges of cooperation.

Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and Ali Naimi, the country's oil minister, have restored Saudi leadership of world oil producers, analysts say.
They lured Mexico, which is not a member of OPEC, and Venezuela into a partnership.
OPEC-wide production cuts of about 7 percent stuck.
''This is the strongest agreement oil producers have had for many years,'' said Luis E. Gusti, the former president of Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oil company, and now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
''I think it has an opportunity to hold together, though you can never rule out leaks.''
Though oil producers do not seem to agree on how much to increase production, they are not fighting the way they once did, an administration official said.
''They intend to keep their unity,'' the official said.
None of that makes oil the threat to the United States that it was 25 years ago.
The American economy has gone through a revolution since then.
Factories and utilities use less oil for each dollar of production than they did then.
The decline in oil's importance is more dramatic than that.
It takes less oil to send an e-mail message across the country than to send a letter the same distance, and electronic communication is a better gauge of economic activity in this country than the postal service.
Still, some analysts say the lesson of the latest price spike is that oil is not yet just another commodity.
Every American depends on oil products every day, to keep warm, move around, wrap food and ship packages.
Moreover, some of the most prized luxuries during this country's period of prosperity are energy hungry.
Homes of 6,000 square feet with cathedral ceilings and large windows and sport utility vehicles with 44-gallon fuel tanks and 5.4-liter engines can make for alarming energy bills when oil is expensive.
''There are three things that can get people worried about inflation and spook the stock market,'' said Daniel Yergin, an expert on oil at Cambridge Energy Resource Associates.
''They are the price of labor, the price of money and the price of oil.''
Oil can also be a powerful drag on rich economies.
The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of the world's wealthiest countries, estimates that every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil lifts inflation by half a percentage point and reduces economic growth by a quarter-point.
The O.E.C.D.
also estimates that inflation in developed countries has nearly doubled to 2 percent from 1.1 percent a year ago, with the price of oil accounting for the difference.

Debate Over Who Must Pay For Calls to Cellular Phones

A debate is raging at the Federal Communications Commission about whether cellular telephone customers must continue to pay to receive calls as well as to make them.
Cellular companies, hoping to make wireless phones a viable alternative to the desk phone, have pressed for a rule change that would allow them to bring wireless calls under the same ''calling party pays'' system used with the traditional telephone network.
Some traditional phone companies and consumer groups oppose such a change.

Notably, the faster rate of growth was not accompanied by an upward revision in key price measures.
That increase would be the fifth since last June.
In order to rein in growth to a more acceptable level, the Fed may have to do even more, analysts said.
''The economy has an awful lot of momentum and the Fed will have to tighten policy by a substantial amount,'' said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs.
The bond market, which normally reacts badly to news of rapid economic growth, took the report in stride.
But the stock market, which has spent the last two weeks listening to warnings from the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, that it is responsible for much of the excess growth in spending and therefore in the economy, swooned again yesterday.

Should the stock market retreat further -- the Dow is now off more than 14 percent this year, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down more than 9 percent -- the Fed might not have to be as aggressive in trying to cool the economy, analysts said.
''It is clear that the Fed is in a tightening mode,'' Mr. Fine said.
''But if the stock market declines enough, they might put off any further tightening, just to see how that affects the economy.''
A number of factors contributed to the fourth-quarter performance, including robust consumer and government spending and a strong buildup in inventories at businesses.
Several analysts say that much of this spending was higher than it otherwise might have been because of concerns about the Year 2000 date change.
With that event now over, the pace of growth is probably at least a bit slower in the current quarter, they said.

''A reversal of these increases all point to substantially slower growth in the first quarter,'' said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International.
''But even if the growth rate slows a good bit, when averaged with the fourth quarter the number is still going to be very strong.''
''These numbers will cause the productivity numbers to go up even further,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
''It is ironic to get this kind of number when Mr. Greenspan is raising questions about whether productivity gains we have seen are sustainable.
Rather than aberrations, we may be on the verge of a productivity revolution.''
Instead of tightening monetary policy to shut off rapid growth in the economy, Mr. Yardeni argued that the Fed should allow what he called ''this new-economy experiment'' to continue until it becomes clear that inflation has picked up.
''We don't have an inflation problem right now,'' he said.
''If we get more compelling evidence, then they could act quickly and squelch it pretty rapidly.''

CNBC's flagship program is ''Squawk Box,'' a three-hour morning show that is more ESPN or Howard Stern than ''Wall Street Week.''

There's no club anymore.''

''Squawk Box,'' telecast from glamorous Fort Lee, N.J., airs on CNBC from 7 to 10 a.m. Monday through Friday.
For the 267,000 households that watch, it is a daily town meeting of the newly democratized Wall Street.
That it is one of the funniest shows on television is hard to explain to anyone who hasn't seen it.
The jokes are the ad-libbed wisecracks that pass between the stolid anchorman Mark Haines and his in-studio sidekicks, Mr. Faber and Joe Kernen, the world-weary former stockbroker.
Much of the humor is what comedy writers call character-based.
Spend enough bleary-eyed mornings with these guys and you get to know them.
Mr. Faber's nickname is The Brain.
Mr. Haines also refers to Mr. Kernen as a member of the Hair Club for Men and taunts him for his other idiosyncrasies.
When Christie Hefner came on this week to discuss Playboy's dot-com spinoff, Mr. Haines began his questioning, ''There's already a huge amount of pornography on the Internet, or so Joe Kernen tells me.''

This is not Louis Rukeyser's round table of bespoke elders imparting received wisdom from Olympus.
These guys don't even wear jackets.
Mr. Kernen and Mr. Faber sit in shirt sleeves at their terminals.
They pull charts, make and take calls from sources during breaks.
And they digress.
A mention of Procter & Gamble's chairman and chief executive, Durk Jager, will prompt a Mick Jagger riff from Mr. Haines -- ''Is he a street-fighting man or mother's little helper?''
-- and a Dirk Diggler remark from Mr. Kernen, who can't seem to get the movie ''Boogie Nights'' off his mind.
The accessible pop-culture riffs, like everything else on the show, are by design.
E-mail from a viewer led to a signature ''Squawk'' feature: the Alan Greenspan ''briefcase indicator.''
Newscasts have long recorded the Fed chairman's solitary -- and boring -- walk from his car to the Federal Reserve Board for portentous meetings.
The theory is that if the briefcase is bulging with papers, expect a change in interest rates.
If it's flat: no change.

''Boiler Room'' takes a darker approach.
A statement about our society by Ben Younger, the 29-year-old writer and director, is gritty with low-budget earnestness.
What that statement is seems a little fuzzy, other than the laudable sentiment that it's bad to con people out of their life savings.
Mr.
Younger interviewed for a job at a boiler room very much like the seedy outfit he depicts in the movie.
He didn't get hired, but being an enterprising young man, he saw a screenplay in it.
In a scene many reviewers have noted, Mr.
Younger's testosterone-fueled traders sit around watching Michael Douglas in ''Wall Street'' tell Charlie Sheen, ''Lunch is for wimps,'' and mimic the dialogue.
But more notable is that ''Boiler Room'' is an inversion of ''Wall Street.''
In Oliver Stone's 1987 critique of greed-is-good capitalism, Charlie Sheen is a union man's son trying to break into the white-collar members-only money club.
In ''Boiler Room,'' Giovanni Ribisi plays a judge's son trying to break into a blue-collar boiler room an hour from Fulton Street, whose very name, J. T. Marlin, is a cynical play on the Wall Street establishment.
Boiler rooms, also called bucket shops, are nothing new.
But that a young filmmaker would choose them as a way into the American dream shows how totally over is the old ideal of masters of the universe in $100 suspenders.
Is the makeover and takeover of Wall Street by people in cheap suits and bathrobes a good or bad thing?
Mr. Grant said of the generally bearish tone of his reports: ''We're not against things going up.
What we are against is the 'SportsCenter' quality of financial discussion.
Mr.
Younger, flush with the buzz surrounding his movie, can't seem to make up his mind.
''Wise investments are not bad,'' he said.
''I mean, greed is a bad word.
But where do you draw the line between greed and wanting to live a better life and the American dream?''

European leaders insist they have no intention of propping up the euro through direct intervention, and Mr. Duisenberg explicitly denied the central bank had moved into currency markets on Monday.

But the persistent decline of the new currency has been disheartening, and Mr. Duisenberg said he was troubled by it on two counts.
The first concern, he said, is that the currency weakness will generate inflationary pressures by increasing the prices of imported goods.
A second concern, he continued, is about ''possible psychological effects'' on the credibility of the currency itself.
The main reason for the decline against the dollar, most economists agree, is that the American economy is growing so much faster than that of Europe.
On top of that, the United States Federal Reserve has raised American interest rates more rapidly in recent months than the European Central Bank.
Mr. Duisenberg is now caught at one of the trickiest junctures he has faced since the introduction of the euro on Jan. 1, 1999.
The anemic growth in Europe's biggest economies has finally improved, and conditions are among the best they have been in years.
At the same time, however, inflationary pressures are clearly building.
That is right at the limit of what the European Central Bank considers acceptable.
Prices are climbing considerably faster than that in Europe's smaller but faster growing countries.
Inflation is running at 4.4 percent a year in Ireland, while in Spain the rate is 2.9 percent.
Italy, one of Europe's biggest yet weakest economies, has a rate of about 2.2 percent.
Much of that reflects the surge in oil prices.

The European Central Bank has come under increasing criticism for sending mixed signals about its priorities.
Until recently, many economists were convinced that it would raise interest rates today in another pre-emptive strike against rising prices.

''It seems like they are aiming at a broad consensus of all the members of the governing board,'' said Elga Bartsch, an economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London.
In the 14 months since it assumed control of monetary policy for the euro countries, the European Central Bank has struggled to maintain its credibility in global markets even as it has watched the euro decline steadily the entire time.
Last November it swung back to a hard-line stance, raising interest rates by half a percentage point, to 3 percent.
That still leaves baseline interest rates in Europe well below those in the United States, though its inflation rate is slightly lower as well.
At the moment, all signs point to a strong rebound in European growth.
Germany, Europe's biggest economy but also its most sluggish, is growing at an annual rate of more than 2.5 percent -- a big improvement from 1999, when it grew a total of 1.5 percent.
For the euro zone as a whole, economists predict that growth will average about 3 percent in 2000, and perhaps slightly more.
''Economic conditions and perspectives in the euro area appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade,'' Mr. Duisenberg said today, a sign that he is not worried that a tougher policy will put Europe back into a tailspin.

Elian was found floating off the beaches of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day.
His mother drowned, along with 10 other people, trying to come to the United States.
''A living mother's case should be stronger than a deceased mother's case,'' Mr. Abraham said.
''It is that plain and simple.
The Gonzalez case was only put into question because of the reluctance of the federal government to deal with Cuba as it deals with Jordan or any other country.
''This has opened the door to endless mischief in the Gonzalez case,'' he said, ''and the delay will hurt Elian.''
More than three months later, after many news conferences and the construction of a tent city for reporters and photographers just outside the boy's house, Elian is still here.
In the case of Khalil Shanti, his future has apparently been decided by one barely publicized family court hearing and eight hours of testimony.
Few people in Miami fly the Jordanian flag from their car's radio antenna, and no one here, it seems, is willing to lie down in front of traffic to prevent Khalil's return to Amman.
''Cubans have a different status in this country than everybody else,'' said Richard Marx, a lawyer representing Maria Eugenia Pereira, Khalil's mother.

In both cases, there arose a question of jurisdiction.
''I am very afraid,'' she said.
She has filed a motion to stay the judge's order while her lawyers appeal.
But at least, said the child's father, Ibrahim Shanti, there has been a clear, simple decision.

Meanwhile, a hearing on a federal lawsuit intended to block the boy's return to Cuba is scheduled for Thursday in United States District Court in Miami.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has argued that it should decide the issue, and in January ruled that Elian should rejoin his father in Cuba.
According to the I.N.S., only Elian's father can speak for him.
But here, where Cuban Americans dominate the political landscape, everyone from Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican United States Representative for Miami, to leaders of the city's many anti-Castro groups, have swung their weight behind the effort to keep the boy here.
Presidential candidates, who have always courted the Cuban vote here, have insisted that the boy should stay.
The Khalil case is different in some other ways.
Both parents are American citizens, as is the boy.
The congresswoman said the community should come out in support of her battle to keep her child.
But there is little chance of a public outcry one way or another in an American city where many people consider themselves Cubans first, and no other issue carries such heat.

''There is no ongoing cold war with Jordan,'' Mr. Abraham said.
Just in case investors had chosen not to heed his previous warnings, Alan Greenspan gave them a reminder yesterday that the Federal Reserve intends to raise interest rates until it is sure it has squeezed any inflationary imbalances out of the economy.
In a speech to a conference on the ''new economy'' at Boston College, Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, repeated his message that the wealth being created in the stock market is creating more demand than the economy can satisfy.
They sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 196.70 points, to 10,170.50.
Mr. Greenspan even took some air out of highflying technology stocks, helping send the Nasdaq index down 9.94 points, to 4,904.85.
In his speech, Mr. Greenspan talked about how the most encouraging development of recent years, the upturn in the growth rate of productivity, was creating problems as well as benefits by leading investors to bid stock prices up in expectation of rising profits.
Noting that ''many analysts are now projecting that the rate of increase in stock market wealth may soon begin to slow,'' Mr. Greenspan was vague about how much higher interest rates would have to go before the market cooled to his satisfaction and the economy returned to a noninflationary growth path.

He noted that the interest rates set in the financial markets had already risen significantly over the last two years but said as clearly as he ever does that the Fed would help the process along with more rate increases of its own, starting at the central bank's next policy meeting on March 21.
The Fed is expected to raise its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter of a point, to 6 percent, at that meeting.
That would come after four quarter-point increases over the last eight months.

''Until market forces, assisted by a vigilant Federal Reserve, effect the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand with the growth of potential aggregate supply,'' Mr. Greenspan said, ''the full benefits of innovative productivity acceleration are at risk of being undermined by financial and economic instability.''
The economy has not overheated so far, he said, because it has blown off steam through two safety valves.
One is imports, which have met the demand that domestic producers have been unable to supply.
The other is a reduction in the unemployment rate, which has fallen as employers have dipped deeper into the employment pool to find the workers they need.
Mr. Greenspan said that the nation could not afford any further widening in its trade deficit.
And despite some tentative signs that the economy might be cooling -- most notably a slackening in the pace of job creation last month -- Mr. Greenspan made clear yesterday that he remained as concerned as ever that the economy was running out of workers, leaving it vulnerable to an upward spiral in both wages and prices.
Assuming that the nation's pool of available workers continues to show a decline, Mr. Greenspan said, ''wage increases must rise above even impressive gains in productivity.''
''This would intensify inflationary pressures or squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to an end,'' he said.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, anticipating the main thrust of the report's conclusions, proposed a plan late last year to streamline the monetary fund that embraces several of the report's recommendations.
Mr. Summers is also conducting a study of the World Bank that aims to reflect some common criticisms of the way the bank works.
But it will also defend its mission against people who argue that it has outlived its usefulness.

The Congressional commission, headed by Prof. Allan H. Meltzer, an expert on monetary policy at Carnegie Mellon University, split along political lines before drafting its final report, which had been debated openly in Washington for weeks.
They then issued their own report that recommends more modest changes.
The report touches on a central issue in this time of globalization: What is the role of World War II-era international institutions set up to help relieve poverty and provide a stable financial environment now that private capital flows have become the overwhelmingly dominant influence on the world's economic health?
The report reflects an often-heard criticism that the I.M.F.
and World Bank have become ever larger even though they are no longer needed to do the jobs they originally did.
and World Bank should be eliminated.
''There were real differences between those who want to fix things and those who think they do such harm that we're better off getting rid of them,'' he said.

The report seems unlikely to lead to a revamping of the World Bank and the I.M.F.
during the Clinton administration.
But it could serve as the blueprint for an overhaul if a Republican president is elected.
Even then, however, other wealthy countries that along with the United States provide most of the money for the bank and fund would have to agree to make changes.
And at a time when Congress has proved stingy in financing world agencies, including the United Nations, it seems likely that the next United States president, as has Mr. Clinton, will find the I.M.F.
and the World Bank indispensable.
The World Bank alone makes $50 billion in development loans each year, more than three times the entire foreign aid budget of the United States.
The I.M.F.
played what some supporters argued was a crucial role defending against the spread of financial malaise in recent years, committing tens of billions of dollars that might have been difficult to appropriate from national legislatures on short notice.
The report recommends that the I.M.F.
mainly help nations cope with temporary problems that arise when capital leaves faster than it enters, by making only short-term ''liquidity'' loans at high interest rates.
The report goes on say that the fund should stop trying to relieve poverty, calling that a task better left to other agencies.
Moreover, the monetary fund should stop offering long-term, low-cost loans with conditions that countries like Russia or Turkey must meet I.M.F.
goals on their finances and economies.
Instead, the fund should refuse to make loans of any kind to nations that do not meet certain rigid criteria.
For the World Bank, the prescription is Draconian.
The report recommends that the bank be renamed the World Development Agency and basically get out of the business of making loans.
Such loans, the report says, should be the preserve of private banks and brokerage houses.
Instead, the bank should focus on providing grants to people who need them in the poorest countries, it says.

The report suggests that as a first step the bank should phase out all loans to nations where per capita income is $4,000 or more, which is the bulk of its lending today.
Moreover, it should allow regional development banks, which have much less capital, to take the lead in Asia and Latin America, where there are many such middle-income countries.
U.S., Strapped for Labor, Lets Illegal Workers Stay

In a booming economy running short of labor, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are increasingly tolerated in the nation's workplaces.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has made crossing the border harder than ever, but once inside the country, illegal immigrants are now largely left alone.
The new lenience helps explain why overall wage increases have been less than many economists and policy makers had expected, given an unemployment rate of only 4 percent and a strong demand for people to fill jobs that pay $8 an hour or less.

YankeeNets Reduces Bond Offering

Resistance from investors forced YankeeNets, which owns the New York Yankees baseball team and the New Jersey Nets basketball team, to cut back on the amount of money it wanted to borrow and to increase the interest rate it will pay.
The cut in the size of the bond offering appears likely to reduce George Steinbrenner's take.

Director's Jet Lag

Jonathan Nossiter is just back from the 50th Berlin International Film Festival, and he isn't feeling so good.
Their reviews appeared in the trade publications Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, and that won't help the film's chances of receiving major theatrical distribution.

But others have found ''Signs and Wonders'' to be a work of great skill and resonance.
Like Mr. Nossiter's previous feature, the 1997 Sundance winner ''Sunday,'' it is an intimate psychological portrait of a middle-aged man in crisis.
(Here, Stellan Skarsgard plays an American businessman in Athens who leaves his loving wife, Charlotte Rampling, for a disastrous affair with a co-worker, Deborah Kara Unger, and then clumsily attempts to return.)
And like ''Sunday,'' this film is an anomaly among indie productions in that its characters are not instantly likable, something that seems to have deeply offended the American reviewers.
''I think the film is going to divide people,'' said Mr. Nossiter over coffee near his Little Italy walk-up.
''I'm surprised by that.
You don't set out to make a film to divide people, but to engage as many people as possible.
''Stellan is one of the few actors willing to embrace a peculiarly male monstrousness.
I find him immensely sympathetic precisely because of the vulnerability and the nakedness with which he expresses a very male mania.''
Mr. Nossiter, 38, spent his childhood in France, England, Italy, Greece and India, and cultural displacement remains one of the central themes of his work.

''Signs and Wonders'' takes place in an Athens unrecognizable from the tourist brochures, a city of concrete, sharp angles and looming billboards for American franchises.
''

Eventually he decided to shoot on video rather than film because of ''the immediacy of the relationship between physical space and human beings that video seems to provide,'' he said.
''It's an amazing freedom for the director that is completely new.
You can go back and readjust the look of the film to fit the emotions.
These are brand new tools, and I found them incredibly exhilarating.''
Vive la Streep

Last week Meryl Streep joined Beverly Sills, the photographer Duane Michaels and the trumpeter Clark Terry in being inducted as an ''officier'' of the French Order of Arts and Letters in a ceremony with French officials in New York.
''Every time I take a film to France,'' Ms. Streep said, ''I am struck because the journalists that I speak to engage in the most penetrating and infuriating and passionate and interesting conversations about film, about acting, about the state of the world as reflected in film culture.
It's such a thrill, and it reminds me of how we just don't look at it that way back home, in the hurly-burly of marketing movies.''
''I see acts like this as very unfriendly toward big cities,'' said John D. Spencer, the mayor of Yonkers.
''Those of us in big cities face problems that smaller communities simply do not face.
Mayors of cities need jobs, we need revenues and opportunities for people.''

Mayor Ernest D. Davis of Mount Vernon was less judicious.
''People will not starve and go without jobs and let you drive your Lexus,'' he said.
Mamaroneck's proposed law is an offshoot of the effort to stop a proposed Ikea superstore in New Rochelle.
But that development is only one of several animated by the same dynamic: the new store is usually situated in a community that badly needs jobs and tax revenue, but its impact spreads to nearby communities that endure the heavier traffic and increased business competition without any of the benefits.
The bill strikes at the heart of home rule, a sacrosanct precept in Westchester, which allows towns to call their own shots on land use decisions.
And it has startled land use experts, who question its legality.
But Mamaroneck officials say they have no choice.
''This isn't a symbolic gesture on our part,'' said Valerie Moore O'Keeffe, supervisor of the town of Mamaroneck.
''I'm not going to stand by as a spectator and watch this mammoth enterprise take place on the border of my community and not try to protect our citizens.''
Whether or not it survives a legal challenge, the law illustrates the realization that new measures may be needed to mediate disputes over development.
The problem is especially acute in Westchester, a patchwork of affluent suburbs clinging to their small-town charm pressed against struggling cities hungry for development.
Tensions have intensified in recent years, both because of the scarcity of available land and the evolution of suburban shopping.
Those cities all take in high-income neighborhoods with grand houses.
But they also have large immigrant populations and pockets of poverty in a county that ranks second statewide in per-capita income, after Manhattan.

Mount Vernon is in the midst of its own border war with Pelham over a proposal for a $45 million retail complex on Sandford Boulevard that would include a sprawling Target store.
But Pelham officials are seething, certain that traffic from the complex will endanger children as they cross Sandford Boulevard to go from Pelham's middle school and high school to the district's playing fields, next to the project site.
Opponents say that traffic in the area is menacing already, in part because of a busy interchange to the Hutchinson River Parkway near the school.
One lawsuit has already been filed against Mount Vernon's City Council by the Council of Governing Boards of the Pelhams, which includes the villages of Pelham and Pelham Manor, the town of Pelham and the Pelham Union Free School District.
The Council of Governing Boards is now considering another suit against the Mount Vernon Industrial Development Agency.
''Although we sympathize with Mount Vernon's need for economic viability, we don't want it to be on the backs of the residents of the Pelhams and on the schoolchildren,'' said Kevin J. Plunkett of Plunkett & Jaffe, a law firm in White Plains that is bringing the suits.

Mount Vernon officials say the developer, G&S Investors of Old Bethpage, N.Y., has gone out of its way to address traffic concerns.
''We have a mitigation plan that makes the intersection and traffic flow substantially better,'' said Gerrie Post, Mount Vernon's commissioner of planning and community development.
''But obviously there's going to be traffic, because if you don't have traffic, you don't have a project.''
Here in Mamaroneck, officials are moving ahead with the proposed law to require developers to seek permits for projects with 250 or more apartments, at least 100,000 square feet of commercial space or 1,000 parking spaces ''in areas that abut, adjoin or are adjacent to the town of Mamaroneck.''
''What we're doing with this local law is becoming part of the planning process,'' Ms. O'Keeffe said.
''The only remedy we have now is to litigate after the fact.''
Experts on local zoning issues say they know of no other effort by one of the state's 1,547 cities, towns or villages to pass such a law.
Harry Willis, a lawyer with the New York State Department of State, which provides guidance to local officials on land use matters, said, ''I'm not aware of this kind of thing specifically having been done before.''
Mr. Willis did not want to speculate on the law's chances for success, but he said the agency's position ''has always been that local governments have jurisdiction to regulate land use projects that take place in their territory, but not outside their territory.''

New Rochelle sees Mamaroneck's venture as an intrusion and doubts it will stand up in court.
''This violates the spirit of the state's home rule law.''
Officials in cities like Yonkers and New Rochelle say that neighboring governments have sufficient opportunity for comment in the exhaustive planning process under the State Environmental Quality Review Act.
''The fact is that we already have a very extensive environmental review process,'' said Mayor Spencer of Yonkers.
''You can't do reckless development in New York State.''
Mayor Spencer is himself no stranger to neighborly conflict.
Yonkers recently saw the opening of a collection of superstores, including Stew Leonard's, Costco and Home Depot, on a 100-acre site near the border of the town of Greenburgh.
The village of Hastings-on-Hudson joined Greenburgh in an intermunicipal feud with Yonkers and the village of Ardsley over which access roads should be used to the project.
Land use experts say that under the state environmental review process, neighboring towns do have the right of comment, but not the power to approve or deny a proposal.
After a project is approved, however, neighboring municipalities are able to challenge the review on grounds that it did not take an issue like drainage into account or did not deal sufficiently with traffic.
Projects have been halted that way, though that has rarely happened.
More often, a successful challenge will lead to a project's being scaled back or additional measures taken to ease traffic.
''New York is unusual in the strength of its home rule,'' said Mr. Roosevelt, the land use lawyer who is also vice chairman of the New Castle Zoning Board of Appeals.
''If you're going to require New Rochelle to tell you what they're doing and take into consideration your problem, that's one thing.
But if you're going to tell New Rochelle that they can't do something, that's different.''
In general, there is no enforcement mechanism for regional planning in Westchester County.
Planners for the county act only as advisers, not as referees, when disputes between towns erupt.
Under state and county law, projects within 500 feet of a municipal border must be referred to the Westchester County Planning Board for comment.
But Joyce M. Lannert, the county's planning commissioner, said the board addressed specific issues like traffic and erosion, not whether a project ''should go forward or should not go forward.''
Furthermore, she said, the municipality can ignore the comments.

''I'm fed up with these fights and border wars,'' Mr. Feiner said.
''We need mediators to resolve these land use disputes.
Whenever a developer wants anything, there are fights.''
But back to the story, which improves tenfold once the narrator gets out of the way and lets the characters do their thing.
Our heroine, Maryna, is heavy-jawed and sturdily built, too old, at 35, to be strictly beautiful, but with a diva's ''skillful gestures'' and ''commanding gaze,'' which make her seem like the most gorgeous creature anyone has ever seen.
Still weak from a recent battle with typhoid and fed up with the indignities of Russian occupation, she worries that she is losing her passion for acting.
So she decides to give up her career and sail to America, and she persuades a full entourage -- including her decent but sexually absent husband and a young journalist who longs above all else in life to be her lover -- to accompany her.
Maryna's plan, rather vague, is for everyone to pitch in toward a humble communal life somewhere, a more authentic existence; the group is inspired in part by Fourier's then fashionable ideas but most of all by the weary actress's desire to be done with the tired part of Maryna Zalezowska and take on a meaty new role.

The arrival of these Polish idealists in kitschy America sets the scene for some charming historical set pieces: they nibble on that bizarre native delicacy, ''dry airy lumps made by exploding kernels of white corn,'' and at the Philadelphia Exposition Maryna marvels at a huge sculpture of Iolanthe made entirely of butter.
Two members of the party who travel ahead to scout locations pick the unlikely setting of Anaheim, Calif. (today home to Disneyland, but back then, apparently, a magnet for Europeans attempting to learn farming).
Living off their savings, the Poles rent a farm, read agricultural pamphlets, lay out a garden and navely attempt to become vintners.
And then, after some stark but rather beautiful months, the idyll falls apart.
The failure is gradual -- drift more than rupture -- and most of the people involved seem to get over it quickly.
Very quickly, in fact.
The novel offers little in the way of conflict.
To support her family, Maryna moves to San Francisco and returns to the stage under the easier-to-swallow name Madame Marina Zalenska.
At this point in the story, some novelists might choose to focus on her insecurities about reviving her abandoned career.
But this heroine is too steely to admit such doubt.
''You feel strong,'' the narrator says, saluting her willpower.
''You want to feel strong.
The important thing is to go forward.''
Auditions are a cinch, and famously tight-fisted impresarios stand in line to put her up in lavish penthouse suites.

As in her essays, Sontag has a terrific feel for the way theatrical styles evolve, seeming vital and true when they burst on the scene, and embarrassing and bizarre the minute audiences decide they are dated.
Maryna appears to stand on a threshold.
Besides Shakespeare, she specializes in the corny but undeniably moving plays that dominated the 19th-century stage: weepies in the tradition of ''Camille,'' starring a heroine whose love violates social mores, leading inexorably to her gorgeous, swooning death.
The poignant implication is that in a few decades Maryna may be regarded as a high priestess of dreck.
But for her time she is an artist of the highest caliber: night after night, crowd and critics alike get out their handkerchiefs for her performances.
That Maryna never phones in a sluggish performance, never even flubs a line, is hard to believe, but then belief may not be the point.
Sontag's fiction, always ripe with ideas, has often flirted with fantasy.
''In America'' has glamour, too, but it's all funneled into the character of Maryna, who never goofs, never seems graceless or cowardly, never does anything to contradict a worshipful saloonkeeper who declares: ''You're a star.
Everyone loves you.
You can do anythin' you want.''
Even Sontag, one suspects, would admit that Maryna is part fantasy -- a pure distillation of diva-ness.
Almost but not quite as lively as in ''The Volcano Lover,'' Sontag's prose here is lithe, playful: in spite of the listless plot, this book has flow.
Indeed, ''In America'' reads so smoothly that one could almost accuse Sontag of placing too few demands on her readers.
Stimulating ideas, as usual, lurk around every corner.
But they tend to arrive pre-interpreted.
So marked out are the themes in this book that within minutes of finishing I felt ready to conduct a seminar.
There is the problem of impermanent utopias.
(Brook Farm is referred to, and Maryna's favorite role is plucky Rosalind from ''As You Like It,'' the saddest of comic heroines, who escapes to the forest of Arden and feels both free and banished from freedom.)
There is the unexpected kinship between Poland and the United States, countries that have little in common except the fantasy that they have been singled out for a remarkable destiny -- America chosen to liberate the rest of the world, and Poland, after centuries of attacks and occupations, assigned a noble martyrdom.
There is the way Maryna's abrupt change of roles stands for the changes ordinary 19th-century women may have wanted to make but couldn't.
''It is harder for a woman to want a life different from the one decreed for her,'' Maryna writes a friend back home, spelling out her predicament a little too explicitly.
''A woman has so many inner voices telling her to behave prudently, amiably, timorously.''
Of all Sontag's themes, this is both the most lighthearted and the most labored.
The observations she makes about America (it's a place that wants ''endlessly to be remade, to shuck off the expectations of the past, to start anew with a lighter burden'') have been made for centuries, rather forcefully, by many of our greatest writers, not to mention by Madonna.
Nor is this the only instance where Sontag plays with imagery that is startlingly familiar.
When the journalist first crosses the Atlantic, his boat trip matches to a T what you expect from the movies.
Ditto the comic-relief character of Miss Collingridge, a sexless spinster diction coach who beseeches Maryna to say ''Idiot.
Not eediot.
And kill, not keel''; she could have been invented by James or Trollope, and played on film by a young Eve Arden.
As for Maryna, with her aristocratic ennui, eroticized yet asexual glamour, cement-thick but enchanting accent and stardom lived as a kind of exile, it's hard not to be reminded of Garbo in ''Grand Hotel,'' tearfully pleading, ''I vant to be alone!''
Much of this dej vu may well be on purpose.
Throughout her career she has been ravenously curious about all categories of aesthetic experience, and the stereotype is a perfectly legitimate, even fascinating category to explore.
But if American culture can claim any particular virtue right now, surely it's a highly evolved, ironic awareness of many of the cliches Sontag is describing as if for the first time.
We have VH1 to tell us all about divas, and talk shows to remind us that we like to change identities at the drop of a hat.
And didn't Sontag raise the stakes slightly higher in that opening chapter, when she said, essentially, Here is what my imagination is capable of; here is what I have been able to see?
The irony is that Sontag's mind has such a rigorous, dauntingly original reputation; her thoughts, it is generally assumed, run on ahead of her sometimes dry prose.
Maybe elsewhere but not here.
Sentence by sentence, scene to scene, the writing in ''In America'' is utterly nimble.

To the Editor:

Lawrence Kudlow's March 10 Op-Ed article, ''Greenspan, Through the Looking Glass,'' is eminently correct.
Another rise in interest rates is unneccesary.
The bluest of the blue-chip companies borrow money.
The price of borrowing money is a cost that must be reflected in the sale of a product.
It logically follows that raising interest rates is in itself inflationary.
The most important factor in raising our standard of living and containing inflation is productivity.
Alan Greenspan has done a superb job.
He is one of the best Federal Reserve chairmen this country has had.
The economy is thriving.
Let's leave well enough alone.

The data showed that Japan was still facing great obstacles in recovering from its longest bout of anemic economic performance in the postwar years.
The most vexing obstacle seems to be in persuading Japanese consumers to spend money.
Many have resisted despite extremely low interest rates and other incentives.
Winter bonuses that many Japanese households regard as a critical part of their income shrank, and a government-sponsored program to encourage home purchases expired.
Economists said the latest quarterly performance probably means that the economy will not meet the government's target of 0.6 percent growth in the fiscal year that ends on March 31, although Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency, insisted that goal could still be achieved.
''We think it is attainable,'' Mr. Sakaiya said.
''We expect the economy to move in a fairly bright direction.''
Rather than fueling optimism, though, his comments created suspicion.
While most economists are predicting growth this quarter, the economy would have to expand by 2 percent or more for the government to achieve its estimate of 0.6 percent annual growth.
Even optimistic forecasters concede that will be difficult, but the ruling party is facing an election this year, which puts pressure on politicians to put forth the most promising picture possible.
Given the broad skepticism about the government's estimates, investors are likely to regard the next set of numbers with some doubt.
Indeed, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 2.84 percent today, dragging down other Asian markets.
''The guy responsible for producing the numbers is the same guy who has a political stake in how it comes out,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo.
''Statements like that don't do anything to increase the credibility of Japanese statistics; in fact, perhaps they work in the opposite direction.''

Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch here, said the gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year could be up as much as 6 percent on an annualized basis.
He is now predicting growth of 1.8 percent in the next fiscal year, ending in March 2001, compared with the government's preliminary projection of 2 percent growth for that period.
The Economic Planning Agency's data produced conflicting opinions, a hallmark of forecasting in Japan.
''In my judgment, this is not a real recession,'' said Masaru Takagi, an economist at Meiji University.
''It's only a temporary pause in the recovery.''
Richard Katz, senior editor of The Oriental Economist, a newsletter that tracks Japanese economic issues, had the opposite interpretation.
Mr. Katz and some other economists are worried that the performance of Japan's economy this year will roughly mirror last year's, with two consecutive quarters of growth followed by two quarters of decline.
''What this zigzag makes very clear is that when the government throws money at the economy, it grows, and when it doesn't throw money at the economy, it ceases to grow,'' Mr. Katz said.
''That's been the history of Japan for the past five years.''
The government in general, and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in particular, have said they will not need to introduce a supplemental spending bill this year.
Many economists are already saying that the economy will need another dollop of spending lest it risk repeating the two-quarters-of-growth, two-quarters-of-contraction pattern of 1999.
With an election looming, there is likely to be more talk of a supplemental budget package after the Golden Week holiday in May, when politicians go to their districts.
There are some signs emerging, too, that private businesses have been spending more money, which could diminish the need for further public spending as an economic stimulant.

Corporate profit also improved sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, bounding ahead 41.8 percent on a pretax basis to the biggest increase in two decades, according to Finance Ministry data released last week.
Earnings of companies tied to the new economy -- those specializing in information technology and telecommunications -- were especially promising.
Mrs. Gunderson added, ''The stress is unbearable.''
The Gundersons are among scores of consumers who have complained to state regulators about First Alliance, a national home-equity lender based in Irvine, Calif. More than a dozen homeowners have already sued.
They all assert that the company has used a deceptive sales pitch, delivered by loan officers recruited from big auto dealerships, to lure homeowners into high-cost loans that expose them to the threat of foreclosure and financial ruin.

The company, which steadfastly denies wrongdoing, has also been sued by the AARP and by regulators in five states.
One, Washington State, is seeking to suspend it from doing any business there.
The federal Justice Department is investigating First Alliance, and the company has withdrawn from an industry trade association because of negative publicity.
But First Alliance still has some very important supporters: the investment banks on Wall Street that help it raise the money lent to people like the Gundersons.
An investigation by The New York Times and the ABC News program ''20/20'' shows they have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars more into First Alliance in recent years, even as civil lawsuits and state investigations have raised increasingly troubling questions about First Alliance's business practices.
The money raised by Wall Street for First Alliance and dozens of similar companies has financed a quiet revolution in the financial habits of millions of Americans whose low incomes or blemished credit histories otherwise prevented them from obtaining conventional loans.
Such subprime borrowers, as they are called in the lending industry, have turned in increasing numbers to finance companies that cover the risk of default by charging them significantly higher fees and interest rates.
Since 1989, Wall Street investment banks have sold more than $316.2 billion in bonds for subprime lenders -- more than twice the dollar amount of the high-yield, or junk, bonds that companies used to finance takeovers in the 1980's.
First Alliance has been a big beneficiary of these new mortgage bonds, receiving nearly $2 billion the last decade, including $103 million raised through Lehman Brothers just three months ago.
William J. Ahearn, a spokesman for Lehman, said the firm's role in selling bonds backed by subprime loans, known in the financial world as underwriting, includes a careful review to make sure investors have the facts they need.
Lehman, he said, is an ''underwriter, not a regulator.''
For much of the last decade, the federal government has largely left regulation of the industry to the states, despite a series of Congressional hearings that revealed rampant abuses.
The testimony did not dissuade Wall Street investment banks from vastly expanding their stake in the industry.
They have financed lending operations, helped companies sell shares to the public and, in some cases, formed partnerships with the companies.
Consumer advocates contend that First Alliance, whose actions have been extensively documented in court cases and regulatory actions, is typical of an industry that often preys on low- and middle-income people desperate to escape financial difficulties.
Industry officials say, however, that subprime lenders can provide a valuable service to consumers whose credit records otherwise disqualify them for conventional loans.

For its part, First Alliance denies ''in the strongest terms'' that it has a companywide practice of deceiving borrowers and has described some cases cited in regulatory documents as isolated misunderstandings involving a few loan officers.
It says it is providing a service to people who would otherwise be unable to obtain credit, and insists that its fees -- which it says are now lower, on average, than they once were -- are justified by the dangers of lending money to the nation's riskiest borrowers.
''First Alliance's business model is to charge a higher origination fee than most, offset by a lower interest rate than most,'' explained Brian Chisick, the company's founder and chief executive.
That, he continued, gives consumers lower monthly payments and lower total payments over the life of the loan.
''Most borrowers are much more concerned about their monthly payment than the amount of any fees,'' he added.
Critics counter that, in fact, many First Alliance borrowers -- who regulators say are largely people with decent credit histories -- wind up paying higher fees on top of higher interest rates than are justified by the risks the lender is taking.
While a few regulators have challenged the high fees, most of the litigation currently pending against First Alliance focuses on the elaborate script its loan officers have been trained to use.
The script, regulators say, is designed to deflect questions about rates and fees, swamp borrowers under masses of needless detail and foster a trusting atmosphere that would encourage customers to lower their guard.
''That doesn't change.''
''And then the $13,000 goes on top of that?
And then interest is charged?''

''No, no, no,'' he responded.
The Business

Making Loans By the Script

At age 60, Brian Chisick has the tanned, broad-shouldered good looks of a native California surfer.
In 1971, he and his wife, Sarah, opened the First Alliance Mortgage Company, a consumer finance company that would ultimately rely on two sources of strength: an aggressive sales force recruited from auto dealerships and a ready access to Wall Street.
In 1980, in an effort to salvage the battered savings and loan industry, Congress effectively repealed most state laws limiting the interest rates that lenders could charge for first mortgages on residential property.
Two years later, Congress erased most state restrictions on ''alternative'' loans, including adjustable-rate mortgages.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

These steps, intended to help the savings and loan industry, also benefited small consumer finance companies like Mr. Chisick's.
Over the next decade their share of the home equity loan market exploded, rising to 32 percent in 1989 from less than 0.5 percent in 1977, according to a recent study by Cathy Lesser Mansfield, a consumer law professor at Drake University in Des Moines.
According to court documents filed in a 1988 case in California, loan officers were drilled until they could deliver the sales message flawlessly, slipping back into the script regardless of the questions customers might raise.
''Find this early in the conversation to make the customer lower his guard.''
The script listed good bond-building topics (family, jobs, children and pets) and emphasized, ''It's really important to get them laughing.''
It offered another bit of advice: ''To soften the blow of dollar amounts, say: 'merely,' 'simply,' 'only,' 'as you know.'
''

And if the customer asks questions about the rate and the fees?
Just say, ''May I ignore your concern about the rate and costs if I can show you that these are minor issues in a loan?''
In 1988, with testimony from several company whistle-blowers, lawyers for the California Department of Corporations accused the company of imposing harsher terms on loans made to homeowners in neighborhoods with high minority populations -- areas that loan officers referred to as ''never-never land,'' according to the state's lawsuit.
Regulators also complained that the company's sales pitch deliberately obscured the high points and other fees that borrowers paid.
In April 1989, First Alliance paid $420,000 to settle the state lawsuit, denying wrongdoing but submitting to two years of state monitoring and agreeing to conduct racial sensitivity training for its staff.
Eight months later, a consumer class-action suit filed in Oakland accused the company of fraudulently concealing its fees and imposing excessive and unjustified charges on borrowers.
In 1994, again without acknowledging any liability, the company paid $6.85 million to settle the case.
In its early days, First Alliance raised money for its operations primarily by selling bundles of loans directly to private investors.
The process works like this: Wall Street bankers invite investors, typically large institutions like pensions funds and universities, to buy certificates that pay an attractive interest rate over many years.
The money raised from those investors is then used to buy groups of loans taken out by consumers through companies like First Alliance.
The borrowers' monthly payments cover the interest paid to investors plus a profit to First Alliance.
The certificates are roughly equivalent to mutual fund shares, with investors owning a portfolio of loans rather than stocks or bonds.
Second, doing the deals gave the investment bankers a steady supply of the popular high-yielding mortgage notes to sell to their institutional customers, who would otherwise shop elsewhere.
The company expanded, and today operates in more than a dozen states from Washington to Florida.
California remains its biggest source of customers, but New York, New Jersey and Illinois are close behind.
While not politically active, they were generous with their new wealth, contributing to a religious academy in Huntington Beach, Calif., and building the Chisick Auditorium for the Jewish Community Center of Orange County.
The Chisicks' three sons, Jamie, Brad and Mark, have followed their parents into the subprime lending business, operating two affiliated lending companies that have had their own troubles with regulators in recent years.
But life is not all mortgages and philanthropy for the Chisicks.
They are listed in property records as the owners of an expensive condominium in Honolulu and a home in a gated community in Santa Ana, Calif., which they bought after their successful public stock offering in 1996.

The Borrowers

Facing Ruin Under a Pile of Fees

First Alliance says it charges high fees because its borrowers have less-than-perfect credit records and are more likely to default on their loans.
But the company tells a different tale to Wall Street.
In documents intended to attract investors, it points out that more than three-fourths of its loans are made to people with relatively good credit histories.
A former loan officer said the company mades little effort to distinguish between customers with poor records and those with good credit history, who would qualify for conventional loans.
At First Alliance, ''customers with 'A' credit would pay the same high loan fees as customers with 'D' credit,'' according to a sworn affidavit by Greg Walling, a First Alliance loan-officer-turned-whistle-blower who has cooperated with various state regulators.
He was not exaggerating.
Court record show that the company has charged loan origination fees, called points, of 25 percent or more on some loans, in addition to high interest rates and big penalties for early repayment.

Few conventional lenders charge origination fees of more than two points on a loan -- that is 2 percent of the total amount -- and many state regulators consider fees of more than eight points to be indefensible.
For someone borrowing $100,000 from First Alliance, a fee of 25 points adds $25,000 to the amount on which the customer is paying interest.
The calculation has become all too familiar to Velda Durney, one of the homeowners who have sued First Alliance.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mrs. Durney's brother built her sage-green ranch house in Fremont, Calif., outside San Jose, in the summer of 1966.
It is filled with evidence of a life well lived: photographs of happy school-age grandchildren, fresh-baked carrot cakes cooling in the kitchen, a bowling-trophy-laden sideboard, pushed aside to make room for a quilting frame.
Her income simply would not stretch that far, and she began to have nightmares that she would lose her home.
Asked about that loan in an interview in January, the capable Mrs. Durney slumped into a kitchen chair, tears suddenly spilling from behind her stylish wire-framed glasses.
''I can't talk about it without crying,'' she apologized.
Besides her peace of mind, she has also lost her privacy.
She had to refinance again to get a fixed-rate mortgage, and her monthly payments are still bigger than her pension income will cover.
So she makes ends meet, she said, by renting out her two spare bedrooms -- which she had done as a favor to church acquaintances in the past but now does with strangers, by necessity.
''I'm getting by,'' she said last week, ''but just barely.''
He added, ''All borrowers are given two separate three-day periods to reject the terms of the obligation.
The Pagters say they were rushed through the closing, signing documents they were not given time to read.
No lawyer was present, as is typical in home equity loans.
Not until October 1996, when they were selling their Santa Clara home and trying to close on their new one, did they discover the exact terms of their loan, according to their lawsuit.
Working on a shoestring -- and chided by friends who saw parallels with the financially doomed lawyers in the movie ''A Civil Action'' -- the firm was representing five other homeowners, all complaining of deceptive sales practices by First Alliance.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

At the same time, investigators in the Department of Financial Institutions in Olympia, Wash., had opened a file on First Alliance, on the basis of 17 consumer complaints similar to those made by Mrs. Durney and the Pagters.
In June 1997, in an affidavit filed in state court, the lead investigator, Chuck Cross, observed that First Alliance's intent ''appears to be to continually play down the import of certain disclosures, misdirect crucial information or confuse the borrower about what they are actually obtaining in the transaction.''
Regulators in other states sought copies of that 1996 sales script, but First Alliance obtained a court order requiring Washington regulators to keep the document secret -- an order that remains in place today.
Company lawyers pointed out that by signing closing statements, borrowers had attested to fully understanding the terms of their loans.

In his written response, Mr. Chisick called the ruling ''incorrect'' and ''a blatant error.''
Growing Opposition

Picking Up Allies With Influence

Even an attentive Wall Street investment banker might have missed the early local headlines critical of First Alliance.
The organization was taking advantage of an unusual facet of California's business laws, called Section 17200, that allows a plaintiff to sue as a ''private attorney general,'' seeking restitution on behalf of all citizens affected by certain deceptive business practices.
State regulators, too, were heading to court.
By the end of 1998, Minnesota's attorney general at the time, Hubert H. Humphrey III, had sued First Alliance, accusing it of deceptive sales practices.
And in Illinois, Attorney General Jim Ryan was suing as well, seeking remedies that included the rescission of all the loans First Alliance has made there.
Steve LeClair, an assistant attorney general in Florida, says that his staff has subpoenaed a ''very large volume of records'' and is talking with First Alliance ''to see if this is something we can resolve without filing a formal complaint.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Florida's primary concern is the origination fees.
''They're just so excessively high that it's hard for me to conceive of any way a consumer would agree to that kind of loan if all the facts have been put before them,'' Mr. LeClair said.
Last April, after years of legal fencing with First Alliance, Washington State regulators finally filed a formal complaint against the company, seeking to suspend its license for two years and to obtain an order that it discontinue deceptive practices.
Prentiss Cox, a Minnesota assistant attorney general, says the company no longer does business in his state.
''That kind of relief suggests the strength of our allegations in the case,'' he said.
But at best, regulatory efforts like Minnesota's can only protect a statewide segment of consumers; companies can short-circuit such investigations simply by pulling out of one state and moving into another.
Some states have strong, clear consumer lending laws and well-financed regulatory agencies -- but others do not.
The early waves of scandal from the subprime industry a decade ago prompted Congress in 1994 to adopt legislation requiring greater disclosure by high-cost lenders, but federal action to enforce those laws has been rare.
And yet none of these legal problems seems to shake Wall Street's faith in First Alliance or most of the other large subprime lenders that have been the targets of consumer advocates' complaints.
But last year, there were more than 200 separate deals totaling more than $75 billion -- less than in 1998 but more than in any other previous year.
The Wall Streeters

Raising Money In the Best Circles

No Wall Street investment bank had a bigger share of that reviving 1999 market than Lehman Brothers, Wall Street's fourth-largest brokerage house and one of its oldest and most prestigious names.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

First Alliance's initial public offering in 1996 was handled by Friedman Billings & Ramsey, a small investment bank based in Arlington, Va.
But through the late 1990's, First Alliance had raised money through a variety of bigger banks and brokerage houses, including Prudential Securities.
In all, it has handled eight separate deals for the company.
Lehman Brothers has not only helped raise money for First Alliance despite its mounting legal troubles but, more recently, has taken a small investment stake in the firm.
Nor did First Alliance's legal difficulties dissuade another important Wall Street supporter: MBIA Insurance, the giant financial insurance company, which has stood behind many of First Alliance's loan deals over the years, guaranteeing that principal and interest will be paid to investors promptly.
With MBIA's backing, First Alliance's mortgage-backed notes were awarded Wall Street's highest credit ratings, making them more attractive to institutional investors.
First Alliance is one of the lenders that have come under greater scrutiny, Mr. Legan confirmed.
MBIA's review does not appear to have included interviews with the lawyers or regulators suing First Alliance.
Neither Ms. Canavan in San Jose nor regulators in other states can recall any inquiry from MBIA lawyers -- or anyone else on Wall Street -- about the strength of the evidence against First Alliance.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

State regulators' investigations of the company have focused thus far on possible deceptive sales practices and have not yet examined where and how its money was raised.
Some legal theorists say Lehman and other banks that finance the industry can be held accountable under the law passed by Congress in 1994.
It holds that borrowers' legal claims against their lenders can also be asserted against any subsequent purchasers of the loans.
Some state laws may also provide a weapon, according to experts who cite a well-established legal principle in most states: those who knowingly finance illegal behavior can be held liable for it.
The current system ''is perfect for washing everybody's hands of any responsibility,'' said Joshua Zinner, coordinator of a foreclosure prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services.
''At each step, it gets harder and harder to hold anybody accountable.''
The subprime lenders trade group, meanwhile, is ''very, very concerned'' about the ''few rogue lenders'' who give the industry a bad name, said Mr. Zeltzer, the group's executive director.
He explained that the group's board has recently adopted an industry code of ethics and voluntary standards that it hopes will prevent deceptive or unfair lending practices.
''These are not very happy headlines,'' Mr. Zeltzer said.
''This is not how we want to do business.''
''Two things are going on,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis.
''You're getting some bottom-fishing for the really strong values that had developed and some long overdue profit taking in the new-economy stocks.''

Helping to lead yesterday's heavy stock trading was a report on industrial output last month that some took as a sign the economy's breakneck expansion might finally be slowing.
If the members of the Federal Reserve Board believe this is happening -- and the production figures are compiled by the central bank -- it reduces the chance of several increases in interest rates and could rule out a jump of more than one-quarter point at next Tuesday's policy meeting.
Moreover, the slide in Nasdaq stocks is viewed as a force for economic restraint since rapid gains in them have contributed to consumers' feeling of wealth and their willingness to spend.
''I think it's the healthiest type of action you could hope for,'' said Charles J. Pradilla, chief strategist at SG Cowen Securities, referring to the realignment of values.
''It's the sort of stuff Greenspan loves to see.''
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has often observed in recent months how expensive some stocks have become in relation to their demonstrated earning power and how stock market profits have helped sustain the economic boom.
''Money is starting to flow into companies with improving earnings and more compelling valuations,'' added Robert M. Balentine, an investment counselor in Atlanta.
''You can't have such a bifurcated market continue to exist.''
And never before this week has the Nasdaq lost triple-digit points for three consecutive days.

Wall St.
Urged to Disclose All Orders

The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, called on Wall Street to voluntarily put together a system that would disclose all stock orders that have not yet been filled.
All markets are now required to disclose any limit orders -- orders to buy or sell a stock at a particular price -- if that order represents the best available price in the market.
Mr. Levitt proposed going further than that, but he also said that he was ''deeply troubled'' by evidence that even the disclosures required are often not being made.

The Dow pulled back slightly yesterday, falling 35.37 points, to 10,595.23, a 0.33 percent drop.
Despite history's pattern of further gains, technical analysts on Wall Street said the rally this week might be an exception to the trend.
These technicians try to divine future moves of stocks from their price histories.
To the many investors and economists who believe stocks are impossible to predict that way, technicians are little more than psychics with computers.
But most major Wall Street firms keep at least a couple of technical analysts on staff.

Generally, a rally will have staying power, technicians say, if in addition to price movements it has heavy trading volume and breadth, meaning that several stocks rise for each stock that falls.
The rally on Thursday seems to fit all three criteria.
Rallies like that ''have tended to mean that the market will go up for a number of weeks and in many cases a number of months,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst for Wachovia Securities in North Carolina.
But he said he remained ''very cautious about this market,'' in part because the Dow remains below its average of the last 200 days, a trend that technicians view as bearish.
He is worried that investors are too bullish.
It may seem counterintuitive, but technical analysts say the strongest rallies begin when most investors have turned very negative and selling pressure has reached a climax.
Recent surveys show that investors are very complacent, as opposed to negative, about the market, Mr. McCabe said.
He fears that stocks will turn down again ''sometime in the spring,'' he said.
Slipping a bit of fundamental analysis into his explanation, Mr. Dickey said, ''We're in a period of rising interest rates similar to 1994, and so I think this year will be similar to 1994,'' a year when most stocks ended slightly down.
In fact, ''Don't fight the Fed'' is one of Wall Street's hoariest maxims, and the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has repeatedly indicated concern about stock price levels.
But though the Fed has raised short-term interest rates four times since June in an effort to slow the economy, corporate profits continue to chug along.
Analysts expect profits to rise 17.7 percent this year, following a rise of 18 percent last year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Long-term interest rates have also dropped substantially since hitting highs in January.
Lower interest rates are considered good for stocks, because they reduce the cost of corporate borrowing while making bonds less attractive as an investment alternative.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.00 percent from 6.04 percent on Thursday.
So there will be an ethics committee meeting, and someone will be blamed.

It's not as though the black community rose up to wipe out all those drug-money local playground tournaments that fed into the sneaker-money summer camps that fed into the white colleges run by presidents who answered only to their coaches who prepared their players for David Stern's global game, which is now undergoing an economic correction.

You think we need some ethics here?
Marcia Sage, a former San Diego lawyer who is now president and chief executive officer of the Sports Ethics Institute in Tampa, Fla., took a deep breath.
''Moral philosophers don't take positions so much as explore the issue, offer considerations,'' she said last week.
''It's not clear-cut.
You can't just look at outcome.
What are the virtues here?
What is the greater good being performed by the church?
Who is being hurt?''
Those ethicists are going to have to wear beepers all the time, carry cells, be permanently online.
This was held last week in the parish house living room of the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in Manhattan, as part of its series on ethics in media.

Some complaints were rooted in recent events, especially the Nationalists' election disaster on Saturday, while others reflect festering ethnic and political resentments going back to the 1980's.
Virtually all of the people blowing air horns and screaming epithets outside Mr. Lee's residence and party offices, or milling edgily at the headquarters of their new hero, James Soong, the Nationalist who has now turned independent, were lifelong Nationalists themselves.
Many Nationalist supporters distrust the opposition leader Chen Shui-bian, who won on Saturday with 39 percent of the vote.

Some have long resented what they considered Mr. Lee's takeover of the Nationalists.
Now what many see -- with no real proof -- as his machinations to further a secret pro-independence agenda is the last straw, an unforgivable act of betrayal.
A more tangible and serious charge against Mr. Lee is that after helping to bring free elections to Taiwan he failed to confront the next hurdle to democracy, the island's notoriously sleazy politics.
On the contrary, many experts say that while open vote-buying by the Nationalists may be declining, improper links between politics and business and even organized crime have if anything grown more prevalent as Mr. Lee sought to preserve the Nationalist Party's power in local and national elections.
''The price is that the party has gotten deeper and deeper into the world of dirty money.''

For the first time this year, the S.& P. is now higher than it was at the end of 1999.

''This is a big correction, but nothing more than that.
It gives everyone a better chance to evaluate what is out there, and presents good opportunities to buy the better stocks.''
Analysts have been saying that bank stocks, which have fallen sharply since the Fed began raising interest rates in late June, would begin to rally when it appeared the central bank might be about finished pushing them up.
''The bond market believes the Fed is doing its job,'' said Kirk Hartman, chief investment officer at Banc of America Capital Management in Los Angeles.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.97 percent, from 6 percent on Monday.
That brief move led to chatter about the resurgence of the old economy and investors' sudden preference for value stocks, which trade at low multiples of their profits and sales, over high-growth technology stocks.
Skeptics, who have watched the Nasdaq soar higher in disregard of traditional stock valuations for years, were especially excited that the market was returning to its senses.
So much for that theory.
Even before it really got rolling, the move out of new-economy companies like Cisco Systems and Oracle, whose primary products are ways to move and manage information, has ended.
For the year, the Nasdaq is now up nearly 20 percent, while the Dow is down 5.5 percent.
But the real proof of the power of the information technology revolution for investors can be found in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which represents a diverse set of large publicly traded companies.
It may no longer be news that the most valuable company in the S.& P., and in the world, is Microsoft, with a market capitalization of $537 billion.

In all, 17 of the 40 most valuable companies in the S.& P. are technology companies.
Together, they are worth more than $3.5 trillion, accounting for more than a quarter of the value of the index's 500 companies.

Of course, what bulls call respect bears view as a bubble.
The answer, bulls say, is that Cisco and its technology kin are growing at rates not seen since the beginning of the industrial revolution.
Analysts expect that by 2001, one decade later, its sales will be close to $25 billion and its profit better than $4 billion, a hundred-fold increase in each.
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of First Albany, is hardly a manic bull.
''There are lots of things to be very worried about,'' Mr. Johnson said yesterday, noting that stocks are expensive even though the Federal Reserve seems set to raise interest rates enough to slow the economy measurably.
''Stocks are going to levels that are absolutely unwarranted.''
Given how fast the companies are growing, ''you can't let historical valuation techniques guide you,'' he said.
And as long as technology companies keep delivering that extraordinary growth, it will take more than one bad week in the Nasdaq for investors to seriously consider turning away from the new economy and back to the old.

The visit to Yad Vashem was broadcast live on Israeli television.
But the sight of the frail pope speaking with such strong feeling in the dark hall, where the names of death camps are etched into the black floor, had its own resonance.
So did the symbolism of the moment when the pope, who usually sits in an armchair while people file before him, shuffled humbly across the darkened room alone, leaning on his cane, between the words ''Buchenwald'' and ''Auschwitz'' to shake the hands of six Holocaust survivors.
''Your coming here today, to the Tent of Remembrance at Yad Vashem, is a climax of this historic journey of healing,'' Prime Minister Ehud Barak said, his voice rough with emotion.
''Here, right now, time itself has come to a standstill.
This very moment holds within it two thousand years of history.
And their weight is almost too much to bear.''
The pope, who during the ceremony listened to the reading of a letter from a Polish Jew imploring her gentile friend to protect her son, has made reconciliation between Catholics and Jews one of the priorities of his papacy, a long odyssey that began during his 1979 visit to Auschwitz in his native Poland and which he hopes to conclude in Israel.
At a special Mass this month, he delivered a sweeping and unprecedented apology for the historic sins of the church, including injustices toward the Jews.
But in all of his many statements of regret, the pope has never faulted the behavior of Pope Pius XII, a figure whose silence during the Nazi era remains a source of deep division between many Jewish groups and the Vatican.
''I am very glad he is coming here, but I want him to recognize the silence of that other pope,'' Michael Goldmann-Gilead, 75, who was a teenager in Katowice, Poland, when the war broke out in 1939, spent three years in Auschwitz and escaped in 1945 while being transferred by the Nazis to another camp.
''I wanted that pope to say that killing Jews is not allowed.
That would have had an impact on Hitler and his army.''

Eli Zborowski, one of seven survivors who shook hands with the the pope, said: ''The pope's very gesture of coming here marks a turning point for Jews and Christians.
He will be well written in the history of the human race and of the Jewish people.''
The pope is seen by many Israelis as not only the leader of one billion Roman Catholics, but also as the spokesman for the entire Christian world.
Rabbi David Rosen, who is director of the Israel office of the Anti-Defamation League and is active in interfaith relations, had a different view.
He began his morning by holding a private Mass in the Cenacle, the site where tradition has it that Jesus presided over the Last Supper.
''We are all aware of past misunderstandings and conflicts, and these still weigh heavily upon relationships between Jews, Christians and Muslims,'' the pope said after the two other religious leaders delivered sharply antagonistic remarks.
''We must do all we can to turn awareness of past offenses and sins into a firm resolve to build a new future in which there will be nothing but respectful and fruitful cooperation between us.''

In the first ''school days'' of his campaign -- he promises one every couple of weeks and pledges to continue them if he is elected president -- Mr. Gore is using the novelty of a presidential candidate's spending an entire day in school to draw attention to his commitment to education.
But Gore aides believe that as Mr. Gore and his proposals become better known, he will catch up.
''I think I can demonstrate to you during the course of this campaign that I have the perspective and heart to do the job,'' the vice president told a group of students, teachers and parents in the course of his day, which ran from a 7:45 a.m. hallway chat with school custodians to a 2 p.m. rally in the gym.
The school, L'Anse Creuse Middle School North, sits smack in Macomb County, a landmark bellwether electoral district northeast of Detroit where Reagan Democrats first emerged and were then coaxed back to the Democratic fold by Bill Clinton.
Voters here -- many of them white, Roman Catholic, blue-collar and socially conservative -- represent one of Mr. Gore's greatest challenges.
They voted for John McCain in the Republican primary this year and are being wooed by Mr. Bush, whose father won them over in 1988 and 1992.
Mr. Gore needs to keep them and sought his way to their hearts today through their children.
Mr. Gore uttered nary a word about the Bush family today, trying to focus instead on the concerns especially of suburban mothers here, from stopping school violence to nurturing their inner selves.

In a soft-focus, FM-radio voice, he told students at every opportunity to be focused and disciplined, as if sharing a campaign secret from his advisers.

To the Sports Editor:

Congratulations to George Vecsey for taking on the bellicose Bobby Knight (''Shadow That Haunts the Tournament,'' March 17).
The damage done by Bobby Knight goes far beyond National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball.
In my last 12 years as a youth sports fan, soccer coach, club administrator and league administrator, I have seen that Knight and his ilk serve as role models for far too many youth sports coaches.
The effect on teen and preteen athletes is devastating.
A coach bullies and swears at the kids, rather than teaching them fundamentals of the game and good sportsmanship.
The kids get fed up and move on to other sports or drop out of sports completely.
Knight-like behavior is not isolated to elite sports teams.
Indiana University needs to get rid of Knight.
The N.C.A.A.
and its member schools need to get off their collective high horse and establish sane behavioral norms for coaches.
If the coach does not meet the standard, the coach is gone for good.

Originally, Ms. Dees-Thomases planned to hand over her idea to well-connected friends in Washington.
''I'm not organized,'' she said.
''The march shouldn't be originating from Washington.
It should come from moms in New Jersey; moms in Tulsa, Okla.; moms in Portland, Ore. And that's what it became.''
Ms. Dees-Thomases instead called a few friends in the area, some of them homemakers, some with special job skills like hers that would be helpful in organizing the march.
They were all volunteers at first, giving of their time, labor and money to help with a phone line and other activities.
But the group's members kept putting out the word, and mothers across the nation kept hearing about them, sharing their tales of gun use gone awry, and little by little the news of the march spread.
The group also began to attract corporate sponsors and recently could afford to hire a small staff in Washington.
Ms. Dees-Thomases knows a little bit about working the media: she was an assistant press secretary for Russell B.
Long, the former senator from Louisiana; she worked for ''The CBS Evening News With Dan Rather''; and she is the sister-in-law of Susan Thomases, a close friend of the first lady.

Members were asked to be on television talk shows, and slowly, newspaper reporters came calling.
Rosie O'Donnell announced today that she would be the master of ceremonies for the march, and Hillary Rodham Clinton has said she will attend.
The group has created a Web site (www.millionmommarch.com) that is chatty and features an Apple Pie Award to those who have called for tougher gun control laws, and a Time Out Chair for opponents of such laws.
The only one in the Time Out Chair so far is Representative Tom Delay, Republican of Texas, who once said, ''This House is a pro-gun House.''

''He's an elected official,'' Ms. Dees-Thomases said.
''He's supposed to be out there looking out for the health and welfare of people.
Guns are a public health issue.
''Shame on him!
He's just going to stay in that Time Out Chair,'' she said.
Mr. Delay is a ''conservative whose views reflect core Republican values,'' said Jonathan Baron, communications director for Mr. Delay.
''One of those values is the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms.''
The National Rifle Association heard about the group, and the association's executive vice president, Wayne R. LaPierre, has criticized its tactics.
A group calling itself the Second Amendment Sisters has announced that it will have a counterdemonstration on Mother's Day.
Ms. Dees-Thomases emphasizes that her group does not want guns banned.
The group is not talking about rifles used in hunting, for example.
Instead, she said, it is focusing on handguns and seeking what it calls sensible gun control.
The group wants all handguns to have childproof locks and to be registered, and all handgun owners to be licensed.
Ms. Dees-Thomases concedes that the group is dominated by white suburban women, but said the members were trying to reach out to others, including inner-city mothers.
So far there are plans to organize rallies on the same day in about 20 other cities, including one in East Los Angeles, which is expected to be attended largely by Hispanic women.
''We should not let one child be forgotten,'' Ms. Dees-Thomases said.
Ms. Dees-Thomases said it was too early to tell how many people would show up for the march, but she is counting on at least 10,000.
''We have to roll up our sleeves and get as many moms out there as possible,'' she said.
''And dads.''

Certainly, Mr. Putin has moved cautiously since winning the election on Sunday.
No one doubts that he will make good on his vow to build a stronger state after he is sworn in as president in early May.
And virtually everyone believes that this will translate into new faces and stronger authority for himself.
''Putin's in-house definition of a strong state is a state where all the other players are weaker than his administration,'' said Boris Makarenko, an analyst at the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow-based research center.
But so far, the nation is still waiting to find out what its new leader has in mind.
Moscow is eager to see which posts might go to the ''St.
And many are betting that the current ''Kremlin group,'' which is linked to Russia's oligarchs, will be well represented.
Mikhail Kasyanov, the first deputy prime minister, they say, stands the best chance of becoming prime minister.
The new government is also expected to include the ''F.S.B.
Group,'' officials from the internal security service, which Mr. Putin once headed and which is one of the heirs to the Soviet K.G.B.
So far, however, Mr. Putin has gone out of his way to lower expectations and perhaps buy a little time.

He has warned the public not to expect miracles.
And his public appearances have been relatively low-key affairs, like today's ceremony at which he handed out awards to military heroes, cultural figures and cosmonauts.
With Mr. Putin focusing on the economy and domestic politics, security policy is one area that may see less of a shake-up.
That was the case today with the decision to keep the 61-year-old Marshal Sergeyev, who has run the Defense Ministry for more than two years.

Despite the Kremlin's claims of success, fighting is still raging near the mountain village of Tsentoroi and even in the Chechen capital, Grozny, which the Russians claimed to have firmly under control last month and where a Russian policeman was killed on Monday night.
The decision to keep Marshal Sergeyev almost certainly does not reflect satisfaction with the ragged state of Russia's armed forces.
But the decision has a certain political logic.
Changing ministers might be read as a sign that the Kremlin was worried about the way the war is proceeding.
The move also allows Mr. Putin to concentrate on building his economic and political team.
It is not clear how long Marshal Sergeyev will stay.

Already, nearly two-thirds of the stocks in the Nasdaq have fallen 30 percent from their 52-week highs, said Jeffrey Warantz, a Salomon Smith Barney strategist.

Housing analysts cited several reasons why co-op boards in New Jersey have explored converting their buildings to condos.
THE co-op form of ownership, though widely used in New York, has also never caught on west of the Hudson River except in Fort Lee, just over the George Washington Bridge from Manhattan, which has attracted many New Yorkers familiar with the concept.
There are 3,447 condominium buildings with 260,000 units in New Jersey, compared with 185 co-op buildings with 27,000 units, according to state figures.
Benjamin Lambert, a Woodbridge lawyer who specializes in co-op matters, said buyers ''still don't get the concept because they are so used to buying an apartment, not shares in a corporation, and of getting a deed, not a proprietary lease.''
There is also the perception that condos are easier to finance and sell for higher prices than co-ops, he said.
The co-op market, hit hard by a real estate recession that sent values falling up to 50 percent, has rebounded as a result of the healthy housing market.
But generally, co-op prices have not reached the same level as their peak in 1986 or come back as much as condos, brokers said.
In Fort Lee, where co-ops outnumber condos by a 2-to-1 ratio, ''prices are close to where they were in '86,'' said Charles Oppler of Oppler-Ketive Realtors, which specializes in co-ops.
Last year, 302 co-ops were sold at an average price of $105,738, compared with 215 units sold at an average price of $76,266 in 1997, he said, noting that in some buildings, ''we're seeing prices we haven't seen in 10 years.''
That is not the case in Hackensack, said Mr. Muhlstock, the board president of the Stratford House.
A major hurdle, he said, is getting shareholders to agree.
Other concerns, he said, are whether the underlying mortgage has a large prepayment penalty and whether more than nine units are still owned by the sponsor, which requires that a new public offering statement be filed with the state.

There are also tax issues.
With the higher appraised value of condos over co-ops, a conversion will result in higher property taxes.
There could also be income tax consequences for the corporation and the shareholders in the form of income tax on any recognized gain resulting from the conversion of units not used as primary residences, he said.
As for the federal income tax, he said the co-op corporation could use losses incurred over the years to offset any gains.
The sales campaign to reintroduce the Stratford House as a condominium will be controlled, Mr. Boyajian said.
Twelve apartments, he added, will be put up for sale at one time, so not to flood the market, and at prices that are not lower than 90 percent or higher than 110 percent of their appraisals as condominiums, to maximize values.
To date, Mr. Muhlstock, who has no intention of selling his penthouse unit, said he ''cannot see a downside to the conversion.''
The proof, he added, will be in the sales.
State attorneys general and consumer advocates increasingly have expressed alarm over abusive practices in the ''subprime'' home equity market, which caters to people with blemished credit records and charges them higher interest rates and fees.
Practices like tacking exorbitant fees onto loans without adequate disclosure can cause unsuspecting consumers to borrow more than they can repay, driving them into default and resulting in the loss of their homes.
Last week, a New York-based home loan company, Delta Financial, settled a lawsuit filed by three federal agencies accusing it of predatory lending to minority homeowners.
Earlier, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, gave added prominence to the issue by voicing his concern about such practices.
Mr. Greenspan indicated that the Federal Reserve is working with several federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to examine deceptive behavior in this market.
Other agencies, individual states and some in Congress are also pressing for a crackdown.
The subprime lenders are largely regulated by the states, whose laws can vary substantially.
In many cases, the chief pressure on lenders has come from private consumer lawsuits.
Last month, the First Alliance Corporation, a prominent subprime lender that is facing lawsuits by several homeowners and the AARP for deceptive practices, filed for bankruptcy protection.
First Alliance, the subject of a report by The Times's Diana Henriques and ABC News, denies the accusations.
The bankruptcy proceeding will freeze the legal actions and force the plaintiffs to pursue their claims in bankruptcy court.
First Alliance is also facing suits by regulators in Illinois and Massachusetts.
The bankruptcy filing will give no relief to customers of First Alliance who face high repayments.
But the troubled lender says it will stop making new loans.
Meanwhile, federal regulators need to examine the adequacy of state regulations and intensify federal oversight in this market.

Some Gore backers are excited about two things in ''Erin Brockovich.''
No, two other things.
These Democrats think that the allure of the movie about a saucy working-class divorcee who wins a whopping class-action suit against a California utility that poisoned a town's water augurs a Gore victory because the story is pro-environment and pro-tort.
''Texas has one of the worst records on the environment, while it's Gore's signature issue,'' crows a White House official.
''And Bush is for tort reform, which is basically denying people the right to redress grievances through the court for having their lives blasted away.''
Of course, John McCain should have been the one to benefit from a fascination with a Frank Capra fable about a little guy, or gal, beating the big, bad special interests.
But now that the senator's out, Democrats are hoping that the vice president, who is chanting the words ''John McCain'' like a Buddhist mantra, can catch the populist wave.
They harken to 1975, when Robert Altman's classic movie, ''Nashville,'' eerily presaged Jimmy Carter's election after the Nixon disillusionment.
''Nashville'' was about a populist Southern presidential candidate, running on a platform assailing the old politics.

In guidelines written for Republican members of Congress, Mr. Luntz advises: ''Women consistently respond to the phrase 'for the children' regardless of the context.''
And ''From getting the kids out of bed, fed and off to school each morning to the demands of working outside the home, women are working longer and harder than ever.

He knows how effectively his dad hammered Michael Dukakis for not cleaning up Boston Harbor.
''Bush wants to get rid of the Superfund and turn it over to the states when the state of Texas is awash in smoke,'' scoffs a Gore adviser, Bob Shrum.
Republicans are still counting on using quotes from Mr. Gore's book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' which is being re-released for Earth Day 2000, to make him seem flaky and extreme.
Mr. Gore warns of ''an ecological Kristallnacht'' and thunders that our children could ''inherit a wasteland.''
Republicans are searching for his unedited text, which they hope will sound even flakier.
Mr. Luntz says that, polling for the Nature Conservancy, he came away feeling that women don't want programs as extreme as Mr. Gore's: ''The suburban housewife wants to maintain the park down the street, not close the state of Colorado.''
''But for years I've voted with the Democratic Party.
I would probably go with Gore.''

With Britain's exporters growing increasingly worried about the strength of the pound, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6 percent.
An increase would have further strengthened the pound against key European currencies, making British exports even more expensive, analysts said.
Sterling has increased by 18 percent against the euro since the creation of the single European currency in January 1999.
Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, said last week that the pound's strength should be reflected in interest rate policy.

Investors' heightened awareness of risk is evident in their flight to the stocks of profitable companies with solid stories.

The resilience of the giants led the recovery of the major stock indexes by week's end.
But an astonishingly large number of stocks are in bear-market territory: as of Wednesday's close, 67.8 percent of stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 were down 20 percent or more from their 52-week peaks, according to Salomon Smith Barney, and 84.9 percent of stocks in the Nasdaq composite.
There is clearly stress in the stock market.
And nowhere is it more evident than in the maniacal moves besetting prices today.
The greatest gyrations are in the Nasdaq composite.
Leuthold Weeden, an investment advisory firm in Minneapolis, says the index has moved 3 percent or more from the previous close on less than one-half of 1 percent of all the trading days in the Nasdaq's 29-year history.
This year, there have been such moves on 27 percent of trading days.
But volatility is not limited to the Nasdaq.
Extreme swings are increasingly common in the S.& P., as well.
So far this year, Leuthold Weeden said, the S.& P. has moved 1 percent or more from its previous close on 47.6 percent of trading days.
To exceed that level of volatility requires a trip back to 1938, a time of global turmoil.
Even in the bear market year of 1974, volatility was lower than it is today: 45.1 percent.
Veteran investors say these wild swings in prices are the market's way of signaling that all is not well with the world.
Professional traders like volatility, because it gives them opportunities to duck in and out of stocks.
But for individuals, it is a sign of a market in transition -- one that poses significant risk.
''Investors, whether institutions or individuals, have really overwhelmed the market mechanism.''
The mechanism that Mr. Leuthold refers to -- investors' ability to find others willing to trade with them -- has been overwhelmed for some time now.
But investors have not recognized it as a problem as stock prices have risen.
Buyers overwhelmed sellers, pushing stocks into the stratosphere.
Investing was fun.

But an overwhelmed market mechanism can get ugly on the downside.
''Market participants never perceive volatility when prices go up substantially,'' said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist.
''They only believe that markets are volatile when prices go down.
That is the bias in investor behavior.''
Many factors contribute to the surging volatility.
Dirt-cheap commissions to trade stocks have lured many new investors into the market.
They trade more often, and many move in and out of stocks en masse, reacting to information on the Internet or cable television.
INDEED, trying to profit from these waves of buying and selling has become popular -- not just among day traders, but among part-time investors, too.
And individuals and institutions alike have embraced momentum investing, a strategy of buying stocks as they rise because they are rising -- and hence another contributor to market frenzy.
As more and more investors have entered the market, traders whose job it is to help them execute their orders have retreated from the arena.

Profits for market makers in Nasdaq stocks have fallen significantly, a result of regulators' scrutiny.
And so the ranks of market makers have dwindled, leaving fewer buyers on hand to provide a floor for stock prices when they start to slide.
''There is very little cushion provided by intermediaries today,'' Mr. Leuthold said.
''There is an illusion of liquidity given with the number of shares trading today.
But the true liquidity of the market is revealed in a situation like we saw Tuesday.''
Mr. Kaufman identified another important force propelling market volatility: Wall Street's obsession with making tradeable securities out of investments that previously would have sat on investors' or bankers' books until they came due.
Home mortgages, for example, are now bought and sold furiously.
''With these new obligations, you can leverage them more, because the market price allows you to borrow against them,'' Mr. Kaufman said.
''This allows a more intensive management of those assets, which also creates a more near-term orientation by portfolio managers.
So stocks are bought more for their next price turn than for the likely value of them 10 to 20 years from now.''
Now, all these trends have changed definitively.''
Mr. Paulsen says these changes may portend a slowdown in the economy later this year.
''The markets have been suggesting that profit momentum and economic momentum are starting to slow,'' he said.
The key factor, he said, is that most corporations' pricing power is weakening even as the economy grows.
The bond market may have sniffed out a coming slowdown; that, Mr. Paulsen said, is why yields have fallen so fast, despite strong economic data.
The perception also may explain the bond market's odd behavior, in which long-term yields are lower than short-term ones.
An inverted yield curve has historically been a signal of imminent economic slowdown.
What all this means for technology stocks is, naturally, of supreme interest to investors.
After all, these are the stocks in which investors have made the most money recently.
Christine A. Callies, chief equity strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, says the love affair is waning.
She does not expect technology stocks to recover their market leadership role for several quarters.
NOT everyone agrees.
Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist for Lehman Brothers, who has been extremely bullish -- and correct -- on technology in recent years, says Tuesday's plunge and pop in the Nasdaq was the bottom for technology.
''Both for the market and for tech, typically when you get that kind of volume, that has almost invariably meant you have a climactic bottom,'' he said.
He acknowledges that investors must be more selective about technology stocks today.
E-tailers look particularly vulnerable, he said, but companies building the Internet's infrastructure should remain leaders.

''Old-economy stocks will participate to a degree,'' he said.
''But at end of day, does Ford Motor Company have the top-line growth of Oracle?
No.
This will be yet another year when growth outperforms value.''
In coming weeks, first-quarter earnings figures will start to seep into the market, and most analysts think they will be impressive.
But some economists worry that profits later in the year may disappoint.
''Profit expectations are too high,'' Mr. Kaufman said.
''And the profit expectations that are embedded in prices today are way beyond anything that is achievable in any reasonable period of time.''
Legislators in the Philippines are set to vote this week on a bill that would privatize the heavily indebted national power company, a reform that the International Monetary Fund and other lenders have demanded before disbursing critical new loans.
The House of Representatives is scheduled to begin voting on Tuesday on the Power Reform Bill, which would overhaul the nation's power industry and put the unprofitable, state-run National Power Corporation into private hands.
President Joseph Estrada and Manuel B. Villar, the House leader, have both pledged support for the bill, which the Philippine congress aims to make law by this summer.
The I.M.F.
has given Manila until June 30 to pass the power bill, along with the privatization of the Philippines National Bank, before it releases $500 million in loans needed to help offset the country's 62.5 billion peso ($1.5 billion) budget deficit.
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have also made further lending contingent on the reforms.
This week's vote has also become a test of the credibility of Mr. Estrada's administration.
Action on the power reform bill has been delayed for years.
''Investors want to see some tangible evidence that the government can do something right,'' said Rebecca Patterson, an analyst at J. P. Morgan in Singapore.
If legislators fail to push the power reform bill through this week, she said, ''it suggests they can't get anything done.''

Selling the company would also have several tangible benefits, economists say.
These include easing electricity prices, which are second only to Japan's, promoting investment and reducing a sizable burden on public finances.
Government outlays to Napocor, as the money-losing utility is known, are a major contributor to the Philippines budget deficit.

While there is some optimism the House can pass the bill before next week's Easter recess, there is less hope about its fate in the Senate.
The Philippines is not the only country in Southeast Asia where the I.M.F.
is threatening to cut off aid to stimulate economic changes.
In Indonesia last week, the I.M.F.
's move to withhold $400 million in loans spurred the government in Jakarta to expedite economic changes to keep the money flowing.
Philippine financial markets have been rocked this year by concerns about creeping cronyism and other forms of corruption.
Fueling those concerns is a scandal over accusations of insider trading involving a friend of Mr. Estrada.
The scandal is overshadowing what economists say is an otherwise positive economic picture.
A trade surplus, low interest rates and strengthening domestic demand are underpinning an economy that analysts at Merrill Lynch predict will grow 3.4 percent this year.
Napocor's financial problems are partly the result of the country's chronic power shortages of the early 1990's.
In response, the company signed contracts with roughly a dozen independent power producers, who now provide about a quarter of the nation's electricity.
The contracts overestimated the country's power demand, however, meaning Napocor has to pay for the power the country does not need.
Worse, most of the power plants use oil for fuel, leaving the Philippines dependent on petroleum imports for about half of its power needs.
Then, beginning in late 1995, productivity began to surge, averaging 2.6 percent annual growth since then, and reaching an astonishing 6.4 percent annual rate in the last quarter of 1999.
Given the current rate of productivity growth, a rising gross domestic product and our sustained low unemployment rates, the most optimistic scenario is that this new economy will eventually produce rates of family economic progress similar to those of the 50's and 60's.

The signs are encouraging.
Real wage growth has been quite impressive since 1997, especially for low-wage workers.
The ranks of the long-term jobless -- those in the labor market who have been out of work for more than six months -- plummeted from almost two million in 1993 to just 637,000 today.
The unemployment rate among blacks is 7.3 percent, the lowest since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began compiling comparable unemployment data by race in 1972.
So, in the face of all these promising numbers, can those of us concerned about inequality finally relax?
Not yet.
Productivity growth is only part of the picture.
The future of ordinary families, especially poor working families, depends a great deal on how the government decides to react to this new economy.

As the economist James K. Galbraith has pointed out, what is unique about the 1950's and 60's is that the government's policies -- social as well as economic -- were integral to the gains experienced by all families.
Furthermore, congressional resistance to raising the minimum wage and expanding the earned income tax credit threatened the economic security of disadvantaged families.
More recently, the fate of the working poor has rarely been discussed when the Federal Reserve Board, worried about the possibility of rising inflation, has raised interest rates to slow down the economy.
But now, with high productivity keeping inflation in check, at least there has been a healthy debate among economists and financial analysts over the Fed's dogged decision to continue raising interest rates.
History shows that trends of rising inequality are associated not only with economic changes, but also with the eroding strength of what the economist Frank Levy of M.I.T.
calls ''the nation's equalizing institutions.''
These include public education, unions, the welfare state broadly defined, international trade regulations and so on.
These equalizing institutions were much stronger from 1947 to 1970 than they are today.
And they will have to be strengthened to ensure that the rising inequality remains in remission and a broadly equal pattern of family economic progress can be restored in the new economy.
''Here you have a product that is becoming ubiquitous,'' Mr. Cliggott said, ''and yet a leading company is having trouble.''
Over the last several months, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to ward off inflation, and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has cited the spending of stock market wealth as one reason for economic growth so rapid that it has kindled inflation fears.
But the recent drop in the market, if it continues, could help slow the economy.
''The more work the stock market does to cool off the economy,'' said Joshua N. Feinman, an economist with Deutsche Asset Management, ''then presumably the less work higher interest rates have to do.''
Although technology stocks have been very weak lately, the fall in the Nasdaq composite index has not come at a time when all stocks are being pummeled.
Since the Nasdaq reached its peak on March 10, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 12 percent, although the Dow, after being up for most of yesterday, also fell in late trading.
Some parts of Nasdaq, most notably the Nasdaq bank index, have even done well.
Instead, this has been a case of the last quickly becoming first, and vice versa.
It has been the best performer since then.
Network Appliance, a maker of computer servers, was one of the best performers early in the year, but has lost about half its value since then.
The pain of this bear market, if that is what it should be called, is also less pronounced because Nasdaq had run up so far, so fast, before it began to slide.
As a result, only those who got in very recently have substantial cash losses.
There may, however, be many such people.
''Judging by the margin-debt numbers, I suspect there are a lot of people who bought in recent months, and are starting to really hurt,'' said Edward Nicoski, a market strategist for US Bancorp Piper Jaffray.

Even with the latest decline, the Nasdaq is still trading above where it was as recently as Jan. 6, little more than three months ago.
By contrast, in most previous bear markets, a 20 percent decline cut prices to their lowest level in at least a year.

In the nearly three decades since the Nasdaq market was established in 1971, there have been just nine bear markets.
Just what has brought on the latest sharp fall is far from clear.
Many of those once-hot issues have since fallen sharply.
Investors who were pouring record amounts of money into technology-heavy mutual funds earlier this year are no longer quite so eager, and in the latest week's report actually withdrew some money, according to AMG Data Services.
One factor that may have contributed to the current decline is the impending deadline for paying 1999 income taxes.
Market analysts looking for a silver lining noted that the Nasdaq composite has still not fallen as far as it did during the chaotic action of April 4, little more than a week ago.
By early afternoon that day, the index had recorded a daily decline of 13.6 percent, to 3,649, before rallying sharply to close at 4,149 -- a loss for the session of less than 2 percent.
Whether the Nasdaq market rallies from here, though, may depend on the willingness of investors to bet more money on the so-called ''new economy'' stocks that are expected to prosper in the Internet economy and that were bid up rapidly in 1999 and early this year.
Even with the recent decline, the Nasdaq composite is up 45 percent from its level exactly one year ago, while the Dow Jones industrial average is up less than 8 percent.

Those numbers reflect just how unusual the market has been during the last year, when large, established companies saw their stocks gain little or, in many cases, decline, while younger companies with little in the way of operating history and no profits caught the attention of investors and soared.

Mr. Kim's party is trying to pursue an economic program of corporate privatization, and engagement with North Korea.
''Young people are very interested in the issue of reunification, and the president has made important progress toward that goal,'' said Bae Jeong Hee, 30, an architect who spoke at a polling station in the Shilim-dong district of Seoul.
''I wanted to vote for candidates who can help this happen.''
Since his election 1997, Mr. Kim's ''Sunshine Policy'' has consisted of engaging the hermit-like regime in North Korea, offering financial and food assistance, and extending it a diplomatic hand by urging the United States and Japan to engage more with the country as well.
The Grand National Party tried to turn Mr. Kim's engagement with the North into a liability, calling it a naive giveaway of South Korea's resources.
It also complained that under Mr. Kim, the country has opened too quickly to foreign investment, resulting in too many takeovers of ailing companies by outsiders.

A lot rides on whether recent market volatility is enough to slow what is known as the wealth effect -- and, therefore, consumer spending -- or whether the market will have to decline a while longer to dampen consumers' profligacy.
There is no doubt that there was a lot of market volatility well before the roller-coaster ride of the last several weeks.
Consider the performance of the Nasdaq composite index.

So far this year volatility is off the charts.
Seventy-five percent of the trading days have ended with moves of 1 percent or more.
There have been 23 days with moves of 3 percent or more, already surpassing the previous annual record of 20 in 1999..
But it is not clear that volatility has had much of an impact on consumers.
Rising volatility can be a signal of turning points in the market; indeed, there were steep plunges in the Nasdaq and other major market indexes in 1997 and 1998.

Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis, said that ''there is a lot of speculation that, other things being equal, volatility will reduce the wealth effect.''
But, he added, ''I am unaware of evidence that confirms or refutes that.''
Neil M. Soss, the chief United States economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, says that when he looks at a ''three-dimensional'' view of the stock market this year, he cannot yet reach a conclusion.
The Nasdaq has seen record volatility and the Dow Jones industrial average has bounced around a lot.
But the Wilshire 5000 Total Market index, which tracks most of the stocks traded in the United States, had been much more stable, at least until last week.
''Should I say 'Nothing much has happened'?''
Mr. Soss asked, referring to the Wilshire index.
''Or should I say, 'Yes, something has happened; the volatility will make for a more cautious consumer'?''
referring to the Nasdaq and the Dow.
''I don't think the answer is in yet.''
The answer to the question is crucial to the outlook for consumer spending and, therefore, to the pace of economic growth.
And that pace will decide how high the Federal Reserve has to raise short-term interest rates in order to slow growth.
In five quarter-point moves since last June, the Fed has raised its short-term interest rate target, the federal funds rate, to 6 percent.
But the economy is still rocketing ahead.
So if volatility won't help slow down consumers, a deeper swoon of the markets may be necessary.
Mr. Prakken said the Wilshire index, which finished the week down 9.7 percent, would have to stay where it is, or fall further, for several quarters before it would have a noticeable impact.
But with the swoon in the market on Thursday and Friday, the volatility and sharp declines might finally get the attention of American consumers.
For the year, the Nasdaq is now off 18.4 percent, the Dow 10.4 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 7.6 percent.

There are numerous similarities now.
The Fed is raising interest rates, there have been plenty of warnings of overvalued stocks, and a bad economic report, this one on inflation, played a role last week, when the Dow fell 7.3 percent while the Nasdaq composite plunged 25.3 percent in its worst week ever.
The theory was that a pension fund or other institution could stay fully invested in stocks but be protected against declines by hiring a manager who would react to price falls by selling stock index futures.
It was assumed that there would always be buyers for such futures contracts.
But there weren't, and demands to sell at the market price, when there was no real functioning market, drove prices far lower than they would otherwise have fallen.
It is too early to fully assess the sources of selling last week.
Margin debt rose rapidly beginning last fall, just as the Nasdaq market took off on an explosive surge that has now been largely reversed.

Some also may have come from fund managers who were trying to raise cash to meet redemptions, real or anticipated.
The latest mutual fund cash flow estimates from AMG Data Services, however, indicate that for the week ended Wednesday investors were putting money into mutual funds that buy technology stocks.
It is not clear whether that reversed late in the week.
The stock index futures that the portfolio insurers dumped in 1987 are a relatively simple and visible type of derivative security -- a security whose value is based on the behavior of another security.
The whizzes of Wall Street have since designed many more exotic securities, along with computer models to assure that they are used safely and that any firm's exposure to risk is limited.
Most of these securities are traded privately, with no public disclosure, and the strategies being used are closely guarded.
If the stock market does continue lower, we may learn whether some of the computer models used to assess and control risk now are able to function under extraordinary circumstances, or whether they may have exposed some firms to large losses.
There is no way to know whether strategies that did not work out will lead to more selling.
But the taxes are still due.
The fate of stocks today, and over the next several weeks, may hinge on how many investors still believe that theory is a good one.

Other market measures also soared late in the day.
None of the market indexes made up all of their Friday losses, however, and market strategists said it would be wrong to conclude that technology stocks would rally to their recent peaks [Page C1].
''I thought we would have an okay day,'' said Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers, ''but I thought it would be subdued.''
He warned that while economic fundamentals are fine, stock prices will probably be choppy ''because the stock market does not do well typically coming off this type of volatility'' and the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates again.
As stock prices were rising, interest rates were also on the rise, more than offsetting Friday's declines.
A sharp decline in stocks, it was argued, could make people feel less rich and curb their spending, thereby slowing the economy's torpid growth and lessening the Fed's need to act to keep inflation at bay .
In that respect, yesterday's recovery was different from the first big one of this month, when the Nasdaq market turned around in the early afternoon of April 4, after falling 7.6 percent the previous day and losing 13.6 percent more in early trading.

''The companies that have been subject to less speculative froth'' did better yesterday than other Internet stocks, said Henry Blodgett, the Internet analyst for Merrill Lynch, adding that he expected investors to continue to differentiate companies with earnings, or at least good prospects of profits within a year or two, from those with red ink looming indefinitely.
''If the sentiment really turns negative, there is no floor on companies that don't have earnings you can point to,'' he said.
Within the S.& P. 500, an index that generally includes large companies with substantial operating histories, technology stocks rose 9 percent, according to Thomas McManus, an equity strategist for Bank of America Securities, far better than the overall index.
Among leading large technology companies, Intel rose 11.3 percent, Cisco 17.7 percent and Oracle 17.8 percent.

The market got a boost from Abby Joseph Cohen, chief market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, who said ''there are a lot of companies that are reasonably priced'' within the S.& P. 500.
Some still consider the big technology companies too expensive.
''We still have a market pricing in a high premium for technology,'' he said.
The Nasdaq composite enjoyed explosive growth beginning last summer and continuing until early last month.
While the index remains down 29.9 percent from its peak, it is up 42.5 percent over the last year.
Asian markets suffered steep losses, with technology issues doing the worst.
Still, there was a clear sense of nervousness in the hours leading up to the New York opening.

There were some good earnings reports yesterday, from such companies as Ford, Bank of America, Citigroup, Charles Schwab and Merrill Lynch.
''I don't know anyone personally who is selling,'' said Wayda Pearle, 38, a welder interviewed yesterday at a brokerage office in San Jose, Calif. ''I know a lot of people who are running to buy.''
T. Rowe Price, another major mutual fund company, said that it had a net inflow of cash into its stock funds, with much of the money going into two funds, one that specializes in technology stocks and another that focuses on blue chip stocks.

Churches are first and foremost houses of worship, of course, but they are workplaces, too, and together they make up a pretty big economic sector.
The 352,000 full-time clergy in the United States, for example, outnumber the nation's 266,000 psychologists and 310,000 bartenders.
Add all the lay people who work full-time or part-time in churches, synagogues and mosques, from music directors to secretaries and janitors, and the religious work force probably surpasses one million.

And to make all the religious events happen, they have to do what people in any other businesses do: hold meetings, write memorandums, resolve conflicts, plan budgets, meet deadlines, hire and fire people and deal with grumpy bosses.
As the early morning conference at Our Lady's shows, the Catholic Church is responding to a worsening shortage of priests and nuns by recruiting people from the secular world.
More lay people than seminarians are now seeking degrees in Catholic ministry, said Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame.
''Some will be business managers and keep the books and worry about the physical plant.
Others will be specialists in religious education.''
The Rev.
But his staff now includes three pastoral associates; a business manager; an office manager; a parish secretary; a principal to run the high school; a director of religious education and another of youth ministry; two custodians; and a music director.
In short, he never worries about whether there will be enough processional candles.
''We're trying to model the way the church is going to be, one priest with a whole group of lay people,'' he said.
''You're allowed to speak your mind,'' Mr. Malloy said.
''I don't see Walter or Marie as different from the rest of us.
That all fades away.''
Like any good chief executive, Father Cuenin has learned how to delegate authority.
Ms. Cocks is in charge of the logistics for baptisms and of liturgical planning, while Sister LaBollita counsels converts to Catholicism and ministers to the sick.
He points to a three-drawer file cabinet in his office that is devoted solely to paperwork for the project.
Now 70, he rarely complains about working from 8 a.m. until 9:30 many nights.
''But this is who I am, and this is my family.''

Father Cuenin doesn't mind poring over the blueprints for the redesigned parking lot or discussing whether there should be a trumpeter at the 11:30 Mass.
But with the little details taken care of (''I don't have to be over there to make sure the microphones are working,'' he said with satisfaction), he has focused on increasing membership at the once-stagnant parish.
To attract the increasingly diverse parishioners, Masses are now said in Italian, French and Spanish.
(He speaks all three.)
And in an ambitious outreach program, the church has held 50 separate meetings with small groups of parishioners since January.
Close to 2,000 people attend one of the four weekend Masses, a huge increase from four years ago that means standing room only at some services.
Collections are up sharply, enabling Our Lady's to absorb the huge cost of hiring all that secular help.
Unlike priests and nuns, who take vows of celibacy and often live on church grounds, lay workers have to worry about mortgage payments and their children's college educations.
''It costs money, because you have to pay people a living wage,'' Father Cuenin said.
''And I think a lot of churches are not prepared for that yet.''
It isn't just the extra expense that gives some churches pause; it is also the threat to tradition.
It is no secret around Our Lady's that the pastoral associates would like to take on duties that are now the domain of the priests, like performing the sacraments.
Ms. Cocks flipped through her Liturgical Desk Calendar at a recent meeting, looking for a vacancy at the baptismal font.
''I'm totally filled for April, for May and for the first week of June,'' she said.
Another task for him.
''I hate to do it Walter,'' she said with just a touch of sarcasm, ''but until they tell me I can do baptisms.

In the last two censuses, in 1980 and 1990, getting those words off paper and into computers started with automated cameras built by the Census Bureau.
Seven thousand clerks, working around the clock at seven processing centers, looked at the forms and entered the remaining handwritten information into computers.
''It was just a question of how well it would work.
But even if we got, say, 50 percent with character recognition, that's 50 percent less keyers needed.''
But the Census Bureau will not be satisfied with a 50 percent accuracy rate from Lockheed Martin Mission Systems, a unit of Lockheed Martin Corporation, which won the contract in 1997.
The bureau wanted 98 percent accuracy, about 3 percentage points higher than the best accuracy rate people can achieve when typing the information.
In 1997, Mr. Taylor had his choice of about seven handwriting recognition programs.
All of them operated in about the same way, by using mathematical probabilities and pattern matching to figure out if, for example, an individual letter was a C or an O that had not been quite closed.
''Different recognition engines are better at different things,'' Mr. Taylor said.
''Some are best with all uppercase; others are better with numbers.''
But to reach the Census Bureau's accuracy target, character recognition alone was not going to be enough.

''I don't want to say anything about the educational system there,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''but a lot of people can't spell Carolina.''
A second piece of software crosschecks data that appear more than once.
For example, it makes sure that the age given corresponds to the date of birth entered elsewhere on the form.
The final piece of word-reading software uses a more arcane approach called trigram analysis.
The software team created a list of every possible three-letter combination that can be made from the alphabet.
Those triplets were then compared with a database containing all the words in a large English-language dictionary.
From that comparison came tables that indicate the likelihood of any particular letter combination appearing at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of a word.
Using that, the software compares the triple-letter combinations within words (identified as words by the other recognition software) and adjusts the accuracy confidence ratings accordingly.

By contrast, the system might reject any result that produced the result ''zkx.''
At their busiest, the centers will each handle about 17 tractor-trailer loads of forms daily.
Each scanner handles 23,400 pages a day.
The scanners are attached to banks of Dell servers with 400-megahertz Pentium III processors running Windows NT.
The data are stored, and the handwriting recognition begins.
I think of servers as pigs eating out of the trough,'' he said.
''If you put more pigs in, they'll eat it up faster.''

After the forms have been read, the data are sent to the Census Bureau for compilation.
Both the data and the scanned images are recorded at the processing centers onto two backup tapes, which are stored in different locations.
(All the actual paper forms will be reduced to fine particles by shredders.)
The Census Bureau will not release statistics on how the system is performing until the count ends.
But Lockheed Martin Mission Systems estimates that it is running at about 99 percent accuracy.
If the system has a weak link, it is the people who are still essential to the process.
Each center still needs clerks to type in data, although far fewer than for previous censuses.
If the software systems review a word and are still uncertain about what it is, a digital image of that section of the form is forwarded to a person, who deciphers it and types the information into the system.
If the person cannot figure out the word from the image, which happens rarely, the actual paper form is retrieved and examined.
Mr. Taylor was counting on the people backing up the automated equipment, who are hired for only a few months, to produce about 6,000 keystrokes per hour, about half the industry average.
To make sure that the Census Bureau meets its deadline, the system is initially processing only the required information from short and long forms; the forms will be run through again later for complete processing.
As impressive as the system may be, it is in an sense already obsolete, rather like the printed census form itself, which dates to 1830.
''My guess is that this is the biggest paper census -- forever,'' Mr. Taylor said.
His company is planning to build a similar system for Britain.
This year, for the first time, the Census Bureau has allowed people to file their forms online.
But the program has not been heavily promoted, Mr. Doyle said, and may generate only about 60,000 replies.
He expects online filing to be more popular in the next census.
''Just like anything else, you'll see more and more people doing it online,'' he said.
So far, the digital world has no answer for question of how to preserve the census data for a long time.
The bureau will probably use special digital printers, again from Kodak, that will record the material onto old-fashioned microfilm.
Independent laboratories have certified that Kodak's microfilm will last for 500 years, and the company says internal tests show that it is good for at least twice that.
Digital storage devices, by contrast, need to be renewed every 10 to 100 years.

But microfilm offers another advantage.
In the distant future, when Windows-based servers will be long forgotten, a simple magnifying glass will be able to resurrect the data stored on microfilm.
So it was in the spirit of putting both first ladies in perspective -- and treating ourselves to a gourmet meal in the process -- that my wife and I headed north along the Hudson River toward Hyde Park, home of both the Roosevelts and the Culinary Institute of America, the alma mater of many of the country's most celebrated chefs.

I was happy to discover that the hill with the view of the river is still as precipitous as I had remembered.
There are several miles of walking trails around the property, including one that leads to the river and connects to the Vanderbilt Mansion, another historic site, three miles to the north, making a visit worth a trip if only to hike.
In addition, in 1984, the cottage two miles away that Eleanor Roosevelt lived in after the president's death was opened to the public after being saved from the wrecking ball of a developer.
It can be reached from the main house by car or along a pleasant walking trail.
After that, she was under the thumb of her imperious mother-in-law, Sara Delano Roosevelt, who installed the newlyweds in a town house adjoining hers on East 65th Street in Manhattan -- with open doors on each floor connecting the two buildings.
In the sitting room at Springwood, where the clan spent summers and holidays, there was a special easy chair for F. D. R. and S. D. R. but neither apparently thought of making a place for E. R.

During the first decade of her marriage, Mrs. Roosevelt bore six children and tried hard to be the dutiful wife and daughter-in-law.
Ken Ringle recently wrote in The Washington Post that the Roosevelts ''were so dysfunctional a married couple that they make the Clintons look like June and Ward Cleaver.''
A small illustration of how the Roosevelt household ran is in the E. R. wing at the Roosevelt library.
It is a typewritten note from Mrs. Roosevelt to her husband's secretary, Missy LeHand, whom many Roosevelt intimates considered to be a surrogate wife.
Val-Kill itself can also be seen as a symbol of the unique relationship between the Roosevelts.
In 1924, Franklin provided the land and built a fieldstone Dutch colonial cottage for Eleanor and two political friends, giving her a refuge from Springwood.
Her husband would come over to join in the fun and to swim in the pool that was fed by the stream.
(The stone cottage is used as an office by a private group devoted to perpetuating her ideals.)
Visitors to Val-Kill start at the Playhouse, an annex used for parties and gatherings during Mrs. Roosevelt's days, now a theater featuring a documentary on her life.
Next door is her stucco cottage, which is most notable for its modesty and simplicity.
Adjoining the study is a little apartment where Miss Thompson lived.
The bedrooms upstairs are small and plain.
Mrs. Roosevelt's, decorated with photographs of friends and family, is connected to a screened-in, wood-paneled sleeping porch where she preferred to spend her nights in the summer.
The living room is filled with books and more photographs of family and friends.
There are several comfortable chairs pulled close together.
Throughout her life, Mrs. Roosevelt loved to read poetry aloud and have it read to her.
Large silver candelabras that belonged to Mrs. Roosevelt's mother stand next to restaurant-supply drinking glasses.
It is as if Mrs. Roosevelt was rebelling against the formal tradition she was forced to adhere to for most of her life, first as a debutante, then as a governor's wife and finally as first lady.
Many of the original objects, like a Chinese sandalwood chest with carved dragons, have found their way back to the house as gifts from collectors.
Others, like a painting over the mantel in the study, have not been recovered and so the space is left blank.
In retrospect, what is most striking about Mrs. Roosevelt is how much more radical she was in the middle of the 20th century than Mrs. Clinton has been at the end.
Mrs. Roosevelt was much more outspoken about race, poverty, foreign policy and dozens of other topics than Mrs. Clinton has been.
But as her biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook has pointed out, there was more support for an activist first lady in the 1930's, when there was a more prominent network of social reformers, than there is today.

Mrs. Roosevelt also seemed to have had more freedom in her personal life.
Her closest friends and political allies, beginning in the 1920's, were two lesbian couples.
While these relationships were the subject of rumors at the time, one can only imagine what today's press would have done with any one of them.

Walking the beautiful grounds around Val-Kill, it is fun to imagine the many picnics with family and friends at the outdoor barbecue, or Earl Miller, who was an Olympic-grade athlete and circus performer, teaching his ''Lady,'' as he referred to Mrs. Roosevelt, how to dive into the pool.
Having steeped ourselves in Mrs. Roosevelt's rich life, we headed to the Culinary Institute of America, known as the C.I.A., for lunch.
(Its Food and Beverages Institute is known as the F.B.I.)
Housed in an old Jesuit seminary on a cliff overlooking the Hudson, the institute operates three restaurants and two cafes staffed by its students.

Back in 1945, Mrs. Roosevelt told Harold Ickes she would not run for the Senate because ''it was not the way in which I can be most useful.''
Perhaps Mrs. Roosevelt realized that holding elected office is a mixed bag.
It can raise the moral authority of some, like her husband, but it can also demean the stature of others.

Two goals by Chris Albright and one by the second-half substitute John Thorrington gave the United States a 3-0 victory over Honduras tonight at Hersheypark Stadium, putting the Americans in the driver's seat to advance to the Summer Olympics in September.
The Americans will face Canada on Tuesday night in what may prove to be the decisive match in Group 1: should the United States win, it will most likely avoid Mexico, which is expected to win the other group, in a crucial semifinal match.
Honduras plays Canada on Sunday.
Mexico debuts Sunday against Guatemala and plays Panama Tuesday night.
Two of the six teams will advance to the Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
The Americans had hoped the Hondurans would have been tired after a dispute with their soccer federation over bonus money delayed their arrival here until dawn.
No such luck.

But the Americans did get the match and 3 points, and that is all that mattered.
Today's match was by no means clean or easy for the United States.
Played in swirling wind and biting cold, the conditions should have played to the Americans' strengths.
They did not, with the Hondurans displaying a canny speed and a dominance in midfield.

The Americans got off to an inauspicious start, with the Honduran attackers catching them in no-man's land early and often.
By allowing the American wingbacks to push forward, which was part of Charles's game plan, the Hondurans used long passes a half-dozen times in the first 30 minutes alone.
She and five other members of the class of 1956 joined Mr. Sherman for a small reunion, lunch in a theater district restaurant in Manhattan, and opening night for his new play, ''Rose,'' at the Lyceum Theater on Broadway.

It is a one-woman play about a Holocaust survivor, a subject Mr. Sherman has written about before, starring Olympia Dukakis.
''Everyone always says I look like Olympia Dukakis,'' said Helene Goldman Singer, who postponed a trip to Paris to attend opening night.
Members of the Camden High School class of 1956 do not get to go to many Broadway opening nights or cast parties at Sardi's.
The events brought back memories of their childhoods in the once-prospering city that is no longer recognizable to them.
In fact, there are no movie houses at all in Camden now.
And the Walt Whitman Hotel, where the class of 1956 held its prom, is gone as well.
RCA Victor, which made most of America's first television sets in Camden, is gone.
Campbell's Soup, which fed several generations of children their lunchtime tomato soup, is mostly gone.
Even the mayor is under indictment, the third mayor in 20 years to face criminal charges.
Before things started falling apart, there was a lot going on in Camden.
Dr. Michael Grossman, another former grad, remembers the radio program broadcast each week on WCAM, a station then owned by the city, which had studios on the top floor of the City Hall.
The program was produced by the Y.M.C.A., which no longer exists, and was across the street from Camden Catholic High School, which also no longer exists.
The recollections of Mr. Sherman (class actor in 1956) are not quite the same.
Dr. Grossman made the trip for opening night from Cherry Hill, as did another 1956 graduate, Myrna Caplan Fineman, who teaches emotionally disturbed youth at the Brookfield Academy.
Ms. Fineman probably has seen more of Mr. Sherman's plays than any of his longtime friends, including ''Bent,'' his story of gay men killed during the Holocaust, and ''When She Danced,'' the story of Isadora Duncan.

Ms. Hermann (Miss Personality in 1956, Ms. not yet having been invented) came from Scotch Plains, where she markets commercial carpet backings made by the Dow Chemical Company.
Ms. Singer came from Reading, Pa., where she runs a travel agency, and Ms. Mulloy came from Orange, Va., where she and her husband, Richard Brown, run Willow Grove Inn, a 1790's plantation house converted to a bed and breakfast with a restaurant that is among the most outstanding in the stretch from Washington to Charlottesville.
Mr. Sherman came the farthest, from London, where he now lives and where he has been able to get his plays produced more quickly than New York.
He is a gay man and Jewish, and homosexuality and the Holocaust figure in many of his plays.

Rising prices for drug, chemical and consumer stocks helped to limit losses in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which closed at 1,429.86, down 4.68 points, or 0.3 percent.
The Russell, which has been dominated by the performance of a relatively small group of technology and biotechnology stocks, fell 13.30 points yesterday, or 2.8 percent, to 468.54.
''Even in the midst of the decline in technology over the last six weeks or so, I don't think investors have reconciled the fact they were overweight technology at the expense of everything else,'' said Jonathan Oleksy, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
''We are seeing genuine interest in sectors like drugs, chemicals, banks and utilities.
Technology will still ultimately command a large weighting of a person's portfolio.
But by the time you wring out this excess ownership more of this rotational activity will have gone on.''
With the Nasdaq market now down 31 percent from its peak on March 10 and 14.4 percent for the year, some analysts said they were beginning to look for signs that technology stocks are forming a bottom.
''The Nasdaq market is now just about as oversold relative to its two-month moving average as it was back in 1987,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his own stock market research firm in Greenwich, Conn.

William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: ''We are getting close to a level where I may actually do a little buying myself, in Microsoft and in technology in general.
If you are underweight technology, I would put some cash to work if the Nasdaq composite got to 3,250.''
There is little question that Microsoft's stock has been harshly treated: so far this year, the stock is down 43 percent.
Among Standard & Poor's 500 companies, the decline has dropped Microsoft into fourth place in terms of market capitalization.
It now trails General Electric, Cisco Systems and Intel.
And it has put a major crimp in the carrying value of Bill Gates' holdings.
Based on the most recent data on Microsoft shareholders, the decline in the stock since the start of the year has wiped out nearly $40 billion in paper assets from Mr. Gates's portfolio.

Bond Prices Are Down

By Bloomberg News

Treasury bond prices fell on concern that reports later this week will show that the economy did not slow much and that inflation accelerated in the first quarter.
Bond investors are concerned that economic growth ''is going to come in at a higher number than is sustainable,'' said Dave Weigert, who helps invest $25 billion in fixed income at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford.
He has put new capital in cash to reinvest as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
''Those numbers will clarify in people's minds that the Fed does need to move at least two more times and maybe three'' this year, after five rate increases since June, he said.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.93 percent from 5.87 percent on Monday.
But the story it tells won't be unfamiliar to anyone who has watched television magazine chronicles of violent inner-city youths or movies like Larry Clark's ''Kids'' from 1995.

In charting a brief but densely packed chapter in the lives of Marie (Ms. Lowdell) and Boo (Ms. Duncan-Brewster), best friends who move among squats and jail cells and rave parties, Ms. Prichard seldom diverges from a path that has often been traced before.
''Yard Gal'' was commissioned by Clean Break Theater Company, an organization devoted to giving a voice to female prisoners and ex-offenders.
You can feel the research that has gone into it and the attendant danger that its characters will register as animated case histories.
That the play avoids this, at least in its first half, has to do with the pure theatricality of its presentation, which has been overseen with wit and resourcefulness by the director Gemma Bodinetz.
''Yard Gal'' (a glossary included with the program says the nearest American equivalent for the term is ''Hoochie Mama'') begins with deliberate artistic self-consciousness, with the two girls egging each other on to tell their story from the stage.
Ms. Duncan-Brewster and Ms. Lowdell sidestep the potential preciousness of this device by using it to establish a leery, ambivalent relationship with the audience.
They are both confrontational and ingratiating, brazen and scared, with their flexed muscles and ready-to-pounce postures undercut by the skittishness and, at moments, emptiness of their eyes.
The trajectory of ''Yard Gal'' predictably takes the form of stripping away the brazenness to find the emptiness and fear beneath.
The show starts off on a sharp, shrill high -- in which the girls luxuriate in the free street life of thieving, drugging and prostitution -- before descending into one hellish low of a hangover.

The events that lead to this point, many of them violent, are re-enacted with great ingenuity by Ms. Duncan-Brewster and Ms. Lowdell, who mark scene changes by rearranging four illuminated plastic cubes, which also hold assorted props and costumes.
(The original design is by Es Devlin, adapted here by David Korins; the inspired urban-blur lighting is by Frances Aronson.)
Boo and Marie also give life to the four other members of their gang, as well as assorted lovers, johns and rivals.
These impersonations, rather than being fully fleshed performances in themselves, have just the right edge of cartoonishness, drawn in varying degrees of affection and exasperation.
Ms. Prichard has an undeniable gift for finding a spontaneous-seeming poetry in an urban patois fed by diverse ethnic rivers.
She doesn't make the mistake of wedging unnatural metaphors or insights into her dialogue.
And Ms. Duncan-Brewster and Ms. Lowdell deliver the words with a biting, proprietary zest.
They own their language, they seem to be saying, and it's a banner of their independence.
This rabid ardor gives an exhilarating charge to the first half-hour of ''Yard Gal,'' which runs an intermissionless 90 minutes.
Once the girls start to unravel, the show loosens its grip.
Though Ms. Prichard refrains from passing judgment, there is no avoiding the solemn, cautionary tone that pervades the latter part of the evening.
The characters somehow seem less individual when they're down than when they're up, like grim statistics brought out for an anti-drug campaign.
''Yard Gal,'' in fact, should probably end sometime before it does.
The futures of these young women are so clearly etched from the beginning in the faces of the actresses portraying them that following their journeys to the brink of adulthood in such detail feels unnecessary.
This admirable production, a welcome introduction to a team of fresh talents, has almost done its job too well, too early.

While at Columbia, Mr. Wechsler served as director of the American Law Institute for 21 years, and as chief technical adviser to the American judges at the Nuremberg Trials.
''I can't think of anyone who ever had a comparable position.''
The case for which Mr. Wechsler is probably best known grew out of the civil rights movement.
By the time the case came to the Supreme Court, 11 more libel suits were pending against The Times in the South, seeking more than $5 million in damages.
Other news organizations were also sued, making it difficult for out-of-state media to cover the civil rights movement without fear of being bankrupted.
In arguing Sullivan to the high court, Mr. Wechsler reshaped the focus of the case.
Most lawyers, including me, would have argued that you could not, under the First Amendment, presume damages.
But then they would have had to deal with 200 years of precedent permitting juries to presume damages to reputation.

Twenty years after the decision at a symposium celebrating its principles, Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer, called the opinion, written by Justice William J. Brennan Jr., ''one of the most extraordinary, far-reaching and beautiful decisions in American history.''
Others at the symposium worried, however, that the decision might have encouraged sloppy journalism by insulating careless errors from liability.
The American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, completed in 1962 and used as a guide by many state legislatures, has been an important force in creating greater consistency between the states' criminal codes.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Wechsler is survived by his sister-in-law, Nancy Wechsler of Manhattan.
''What his article did, very effectively, is remind us of lawyers' professional obligation to examine, unsparingly, even the ultimate triumphs of the legal system, like Brown v. Board of Education.
''His point was that the way we decide things is very often -- he'd say always, I'd say often -- as important as what we decide.''
The value of the euro has plunged more than 20 percent against the dollar in the 16 months since its adoption by 11 members of the European Union.
The drop, from almost $1.20 in January 1999 to about 90 cents today, upsets Europeans who find a falling currency embarrassing.
A deeper issue is that some Europeans fear the euro might be on the verge of free fall, which would raise the price of imports, thereby reducing living standards and adding to inflationary pressures.
To keep inflation in check, the European Central Bank might decide to raise interest rates to slow the economy.
American exporters worry that a falling euro -- which means a rising dollar -- will turn Europeans away from American products.
These fears are exaggerated.
Currencies rise and fall.
Fluctuations of the euro are far from alarming.
Indeed, the basket of currencies that make up the euro rose in value before its formal introduction.
Between the summer of 1998 and now, the value of those currencies has hardly budged.
The United States has been growing at a fast rate, attracting a steady inflow of European capital.
Europe has grown more slowly, leading to an outflow of capital.
The imbalance has more people wanting to sell euros than buy them.
These trends are likely to prove temporary.
The impact on the United States and Europe of ordinary fluctuations in the euro-dollar exchange rate is modest.
Both import relatively few goods, compared with the overall size of their economies.
The impact of a falling euro on the living standards of Europeans is small.
Nor does a falling euro raise import prices enough to substantially affect inflation.
The danger is that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates anyway, just to maintain the value of the euro high enough for Europe to keep bragging about its new currency -- a dangerous trap for a Continent whose unemployment rates hover at more than twice the American level.
Europe appears to be making more of the euro's problems than its fluctuations deserve.
Most of the Continent is recovering well.
Inflation is subdued.
Those hopes have been temporarily dashed.
But the euro is young.
As the European Union expands, so too will use of the euro.
The euro is here to stay, though its value will continue to move up and down.
He would cut taxes $250 billion over 10 years, and his biggest spending proposal is for a $200 billion prescription drug benefit for Medicare.
He says the prudent thing to do is to devote large sums to reducing the national debt, which should help keep interest rates down, and to shoring up Social Security and Medicare.
An unspent surplus automatically reduces the debt.

But, as Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, observed, ''In historical perspective, you would have to conclude that both candidates are fiscally prudent because both are attempting to reserve the surpluses in the Social Security system for debt reduction.''
There is another index of shared prudence.
Mr. Bush's tax cuts do not approach the level urged by Ronald Reagan in 1980.
Mr. Gore's Medicare drug plan is nowhere near as costly as the national health insurance plan Bill Clinton promised in 1992.
Side-by-side comparisons are virtually meaningless.
The candidates assume surpluses of very different sizes, and Mr. Gore's proposals cover the years 2001 to 2010 while Mr. Bush's cover 2002 to 2006.
These are, moreover, campaign promises, not blood oaths.
Candidates change their minds after election, like Mr. Clinton on middle-class tax cuts, or when circumstances change, as when a freshly inaugurated Jimmy Carter had to confront rising inflation.
But each approach can be judged for internal consistency -- and, with less certainty, for the plausibility of the underlying assumptions.
On those scores, Dr. Reischauer says both candidates ''are skating right along the edge of the ice,'' by proposing to ''absorb all of the projected on-budget surplus'' in tax cuts and new spending.
Mr. Bush's surplus is bigger, $586 billion in five years.
Mr. Gore relies on estimates by the White House Office of Management and Budget, which expects the surplus to be $164 billion.
The difference is not created by the old-fashioned ''rosy scenario'' of the 70's and 80's, when government made wildly optimistic guesses about growth rates to justify spending and tax cuts.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, notes that among other forecasts, Wall Street's Blue Chip forecast calls for 3.2 percent annual growth, while the Bush campaign predicts 2.7 percent.
''We actually are quite cautious on the growth side,'' he said.
(The White House budget office and Mr. Gore predict 2.6 percent.)

Instead, the difference arises because Mr. Bush makes a much lower estimate of what Congress will spend than do the Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Gore.
The agency estimate basically assumes that spending will grow at about the rate of inflation, and the Congressional Budget Office's latest study ducked the issue, by offering three guesses.
Mr. Lindsey said, ''Congress is capable of spending that much money,'' but under pressure from a new President Bush, he thinks it would not.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Maybe, but restraint from the Congress that thinks of the constitutionally required decennial census as a spending emergency, is pretty optimistic.
Dr. Reischauer calls the Gore assumptions ''a good deal more plausible,'' but even so, he says, Congress might spend even more.
The Gore camp says the Bush accounting overlooks that his tax cuts and spending increases mean the national debt will not be cut as much as the Congressional Budget Office had assumed, and that interest payments on the national debt will cost $56 billion more.
But $483 billion for tax cuts, plus promises of $46 billion for health care, $13 billion for education and $25 billion for defense add up to $567 billion; so only $19 billion of surplus would be left to pay $56 billion in added debt interest.
Mr. Lindsey replies that the issue is, ''Have we left ourselves enough room?
I think we have.''
He says Mr. Bush will soon speak on ''government reform'' and lay out enough spending cuts to make things balance.
The Gore camp also contends that Mr. Bush's tax cuts would balloon in later years.
Mr. Gore charged on Monday that even if the economy grew fast enough to afford them through 2006, the last year the Bush campaign's documents discuss, there is no hope that it could pay for the $2.1 trillion they would cost through 2010.
Mr. Lindsey says his estimate of the cost of the tax cut through 2010 is $1.3 trillion, and that it is affordable because ''surpluses grow quite quickly after 2006.''
But out-year surpluses are the ''most speculative,'' said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group of deficit hawks.
That is a problem for the Gore campaign, too.
Three-fifths of the $746 billion, 10-year surplus it wants to use would arrive in the last three years of its plan.
Mr. Gore's $250 billion net tax cut is vague.
Its details have not been spelled out, but it will include some, if not all, of the cuts proposed by Mr. Clinton in February.
Some of the $146 billion Mr. Gore has proposed for expanding health insurance for the poor comes in the form of a tax credit, and so is also part of that $250 billion.
The overlaps and vagueness of the Gore proposals invite skepticism.
A murky pie chart appeared on Tuesday, listing: $432 billion for ''Medicare Solvency and Prescription Drug Benefit,'' $380 billion for ''Health care coverage and tax relief'' (with three asterisks indicating ''includes other investments''), and $64 billion for ''debt service.''
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ''It appears that the vice president is doing his best to hide how much money he wants to spend.
Is it any wonder that sometimes people question whether the vice president has a credibility problem?''
He said he believed that if Mr. Gore is elected ''his first inclination will be to spend more taxpayer money, particularly if that is what organized labor wants.''

But each side believes in the surplus.
''They just have different assumptions.''
But those assumptions ''of huge surpluses as far as the eye can see,'' should be treated very skeptically, he said.
Many other animals are still in the development stage.
For example, Nexia Biotechnologies in Canada is working on a goat that carries a gene from spiders allowing it to produce spider silk in its milk.
When the spider silk, which consists of extremely strong, light proteins, is extracted from the goat's milk, the substance, potentially, can be used in applications like bulletproof vests.

Scientific competition is fierce.
Some compounds of interest, like the human blood protein erythropoietin, which has not yet been produced by a pharm animal, command prices of more than $15 million an ounce.
''There is no limit to what can be done,'' said Dr. Francois Pothier, reproductive biologist at the University of Laval in Canada, who is working on a pig that is genetically engineered to produce a drug.
But because research required to create these animals can take years, the drugs they produce, he said, have to be ''very interesting and very expensive.''
Dr. Pothier said his pigs would produce a drug in their semen, which the pigs could be trained to donate regularly in voluminous quantities.
Dr. Ann Gibbins, molecular geneticist at the University of Guelph, in Canada, and her team are trying to create chickens that make antibiotics in their eggs.
Researchers say pharm animals are the only way to produce some of the more complex proteins needed for use as drugs.
Some very simple proteins, like insulin, can be churned out by genetically modified bacteria.
But some proteins require being folded in particular ways or having sugars added before they can be used.
Bacterial cells cannot carry out these advanced tasks but animal cells can, making pharm animals the producers of choice.

Pharm animals are also of interest because some therapeutic proteins otherwise have to be collected from blood donated by people, which can be tainted by viruses.
Because they are domesticated and are so valuable, pharm animals are extremely unlikely to escape or pose any environmental threat.
But they may still pose risks.
Animal tissues and fluids can contain other disease-causing contaminants, like prions, a poorly understood class of molecules associated with maladies including mad cow disease.
In addition, while animal rights groups have remained relatively quiet on the issue of genetically engineered animals, some say that the use of animals as living factories raises troubling ethical issues.
There are also food safety issues.
''Those goats are not going to just get a decent burial after they grow old and stop producing silk,'' said John Matheson, senior regulatory review scientist at the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration, ''so we have to look at them as potential food and as potential feed ingredients.''
Noting that animal feed often contains ingredients like rotting animals killed on highways and parts of slaughtered animals, Mr. Matheson said, ''Transgenics should be the least of your worries, frankly.''

Correction: May 5, 2000, Friday An article on Monday about genetically modified animals and a chart illustrating them misidentified the company that is engineering a goat to produce a human protein in milk.

THE DOLLAR RISES.
The dollar rose to a two-month high against the yen on expectations that U.S. economic growth and interest rates will outpace Japan's.
So this is the way the euro begins: not with a bang but a whimper.
This never made much sense if you thought it through; but anyway, it hasn't happened.
Introduced at a value of roughly $1.17, the euro has been more or less steadily declining ever since; last week it briefly fell almost to 90 cents before staging a modest recovery.
As it happens, when it comes to the euro I am an ugly American.
So you might expect me to be gloating over the euro's slide.
But the truth is that the weakness of the euro is not a sign of economic malaise.
European economies are actually doing somewhat better than most outsiders, myself included, expected.
And the currency's decline despite that good news says more about the rationality of markets than about Europe's monetary experiment.
Europe's three fundamental problems -- the problems that monetary union gave Europeans an excuse to ignore -- are jobs, jobs and jobs.
An old joke among economists is that the European definition of a boom is a year in which the unemployment rate rises less than usual.
Behind this poor employment performance lies the phenomenon of ''eurosclerosis'': a labor market so clogged with government rules and regulations that European companies have had little incentive to create new jobs -- especially the low-wage jobs that in the United States provide the young and minority groups with a first step into the world of work.
Europeans have, of course, been caustic about the American model.
And this rhetoric, whose implications we ugly Americans in turn tend to ridicule as a policy of no jobs at good wages, continues unabated.

But if you look at what is actually happening in Europe, you discover that in the last couple of years quite a lot of job creation has in fact taken place -- and much of it involves the creation of precisely the kind of low-wage employment that European governments supposedly oppose.
The telltale sign is what is happening to output per worker; in the countries where employment is expanding fastest, like Spain, productivity is actually declining.
This is, believe it or not, a good sign, an indicator that marginal workers are finally finding jobs.

The government of France, for example, continues to talk the talk of horror at the brutal American model of capitalism.
In reality, however, even as the French government introduces seemingly anti-market policies like a mandated reduction in the workweek, it has quietly allowed companies to exploit loopholes in the system -- using the shortened official workweek as an excuse to scrap old rules about worker scheduling, employing vast numbers of part-time workers, and so on.
The result is that while unemployment in much of Europe is still extremely high by U.S. standards, and especially so among the young, it is finally starting to come down.
Does this mean that the weakness of the euro is unjustified, that markets are not giving Europe enough credit?
In a word, yes.
Look at the interest rates: 10-year euro bonds yield about 5.2 percent, not much less than the 6.1 percent yield on dollar bonds.
So anyone who buys a dollar bond instead of a euro bond is in effect forecasting that the euro will be worth barely more 10 years from now than it is today.
This is just not plausible when you bear in mind that the United States is running a huge trade deficit -- and has inflation that, while not severe, is significantly above the rate in Europe.
The weakness of the euro, then, is not a verdict on the European economy.
It's just one of those things that markets do now and then; and it, too, shall pass.
Both reports increased anxiety about the Fed's May 16 meeting, at which it is expected to raise interest rates for the sixth time since June.
[Page C8.]
The yield on the two-year note rose to 6.74 percent and is the highest it has been in 5 years.

''The program is intended to send a clear signal that we want to focus on housing that relies more on private financing and less on public subsidies,'' he said.
Of the $145 million being invested in the initial projects, $11.7 million is in direct public subsidy, he said.

The city is selling the first eight sites for $1 each to developers, whose proposals were selected last month from 44 others.
While many civic and political leaders in Harlem have welcomed the new housing, there are concerns.
One is the lack of opportunities for home ownership; another is that few Harlem-based development groups were selected to build the projects.
Five of the initial eight projects are to receive financing from the New York City Housing Development Corporation's New Housing Opportunities Program.
It provides developers with bond financing as well as a subsidy in the form of a second loan at an interest rate of 1 percent for up to $40,000 per unit.
Depending on family size, the tenant's annual income may not exceed seven or eight times the monthly rents, or 250 percent of the median city income, or $140,500, whichever is less.
Tenants are expected typically to earn $40,000 to $90,000 a year.
Maximum monthly rents are to range from $850 for a studio to $1,750 for a three-bedroom unit.

Among the projects is a 64-unit, 6-story apartment building at the southwest corner of Frederick Douglass Boulevard and West 117th Street.
The $15 million project will include a 31,500-square-foot annex for the John A. Reisenbach Charter School as well as 5,300 square feet of stores.
It will be developed using $1.9 million in bond financing from the city's Housing Development Corporation and $1 million from the borough president's office.
The developer is a joint venture of TNS Development Group of Mount Vernon and Lemle & Wolff of the Bronx.
''Harlem is an active market where rents are rising,'' said Steven M. Judelson, vice president of TNS.
''But today, the rental income is still not enough to cover the cost of developing and owning the project.''
He said the partners would invest $2.2 million of their own money into the project and secure the rest from private sources.
Rents for the one- to three-bedroom apartments are expected to be $850 to $1,250 a month.
The partners, using $1.2 million in private financing, will also redevelop a smaller site, about 200 feet east of their corner site, into three four-story three-family homes.

The other middle-income projects are a 145-apartment building on the west side of Fifth Avenue between 138th and 139th Streets; a 144-unit structure on the west side of First Avenue between 102nd and 103rd Streets; a 98-unit building on the northeast corner of Douglass Boulevard and West 117th Street; and a 41-unit on the south side of 117th Street between Douglass Boulevard and St. Nicholas Avenue.
The final two developments, both on Bradhurst Avenue, are proposed as so-called 80-20 projects.
With such projects, the state or the city issues tax-exempt bonds to provide financing to builders, who in return keep 20 percent of the rentals affordable to low-income tenants.
The remaining units are leased at market rents.
Those projects -- one with 153 apartments in an 11-story, $35 million building, the other with 60 units in a 5-story $16 million structure -- are to rise on the northeast corner and southwest corner respectively of Bradhurst Avenue and West 145th Street.
The developer is a partnership between the Richman Group, based in Elmsford, N.Y., and the Gotham Organization of Manhattan.
Plans call for each of the buildings to have one- to three-bedroom apartments, with 608 to 1,200 square feet.
The affordable units will be for tenants with annual incomes of up to $32,600, depending on family size.
Monthly rents for the market-rate apartments are expected to be $1,200 to $2,700 a month, said Pam King, assistant vice president of the Richman Group.
She accused prosecutors of anonymously releasing information to the news media to sully her and her son's reputations.
''I am this boy's mother and we are innocent and I wanted to take that stand.''
Mrs. Kimes, 65, and her son Kenneth, 24, are accused of killing Irene Silverman, an Upper East Side socialite, on July 5, 1998, as part of a sophisticated scheme to steal her town house.
Mrs. Silverman's body has never been found, but prosecutors have presented 129 witnesses and more than 400 pieces of evidence in a three-month trial that they contend has proved that the Kimses committed the murder.
''I'm afraid of you, I'm afraid of this corrupt system, I'm afraid of the gossip, the lies, that have been fed about my son and me,'' she said.
''I'm afraid of this!
That everybody in New York believes this!''
She then shouted, ''We're innocent!
For God's sake, help us!''

But the judge also barred prosecutors from asking Mrs. Kimes about a 1998 killing in Los Angeles that she and her son have been charged with, and two other homicides that they are suspected of committing.
But others supported it, noting that the judge had barred prosecutors from asking Mrs. Kimes about the other homicide cases.
''That's a perfectly normal ruling that is consistent with the law,'' said Eddie Hayes, a prominent Manhattan defense lawyer who scoffed at Mrs. Kimes's complaints.
He said that ''if she takes the stand, the district attorney will rip her heart out.''
Final arguments in the trial are expected to begin on Monday.
We look at a number of leading indicators that power spending growth.
One is real wage growth, which peaked in April 1998 at 3.4 percent, and has now decelerated to 1.3 percent.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The second is housing turnover, which also peaked in the spring of 1998 at a growth rate of 16.1 percent.
Currently it is declining at a 7.6 percent annual rate.
That means fewer and fewer new and existing homes are being sold, even though the level of activity is still very high.
The third factor we look at is installment credit, which is growing at the same rate it did a year ago.
With personal consumption spending growing at somewhere between 5 percent and 6 percent and all these indicators heading south, we felt we would probably see a deceleration in retail sales growth in the second half of the year.
That's why we cut our ratings.
Q.
Could you give some insight into the anatomy of your decision?
A.
We have been watching these indicators for a year and a half.
I may have let the decision to downgrade these stocks slide a little bit because of the market, and because from an absolute perspective real wage growth at 2 percent was not so bad.

Q.
The Federal Reserve has been raising short-term rates, and is likely to raise them some more.
Was that a factor?
A.
We don't see much, if any, correlation between change in the federal funds rate and changes in real personal consumption expenditure.
If I am on my way to Wal-Mart and I hear the Fed has raised the funds rate, the information doesn't change my behavior a bit.
We are six months into a rising rate environment and spending hasn't slowed a whit.
Q.
How much of a slowdown do you see?
A.
We think we will see a deceleration in the growth of personal consumption expenditures from about 5.7 percent currently to around 4 percent.
Now, 4 percent is a pretty decent level of growth.
In an expansion you normally see personal consumption growth average about 3 percent.
So that deceleration may not be enough to satisfy the Fed.
Q.
And yet since the start of the year the stocks have been weak.
Are retailing stocks projecting a slowdown in the economy?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A. I wouldn't say retailing stocks have been leading indicators of economic slowdowns.
What has made retailing interesting in this cycle has been the rise in personal consumption alongside the problems in Asia, which slowed exports and industrial production.
The growth names had a marvelous late cycle move, which is uncharacteristic.
Q.
What other retailers are growth stocks?
A.
In addition to Wal-Mart, Costco, Target Stores and Kohl's are the pure growth stocks in my sector.
Tiffany is another growth stock, but I don't cover it.
A lot of these stocks have outperformed the market by as much as 80 percent over the last two years.
And I think these five stocks will continue to provide market leadership.
They still have tremendous growth opportunities in front of them.
Q.
Which are you less enthusiastic about?
A.
But so far it has been a boon to the very currencies with which it was supposed to compete.
Now Americans brandishing dollars or Britons spending pounds are finding bargains from Amsterdam to Vienna.

On Friday, in an extraordinary statement for a central banker, the president of the European Central Bank, who is to the euro what Alan Greenspan is to the dollar, all but apologized for its descent, saying it could ''undermine the perception of the euro as a stable currency.''
He and and another top official hinted, for the first time, that the bank might reverse its policy and try to raise the value of the euro by going into currency markets and using its reserve of dollars to buy euros.
Thanks to the euro, the price of a McDonald's Big Mac costs less in Germany than in the United States.
French wines, Belgian beers and Italian shoes are all bargains when priced in dollars.
Euro bills and coins are not yet in circulation, but local currencies like the German mark and French franc are locked to the euro's value and controlled by the European Central Bank, in Frankfurt.
That means that euro weakness matters little for Germans buying goods with marks or Italians with lire.
''As long as I don't go on vacation in the United States, it doesn't bother me,'' said Dagmar Hofmann, a rose cultivator who brings her flowers into Frankfurt every Friday.
But it means that the euro is suffering a crisis of confidence.
Since its debut as the official monetary measure of Europe, used mostly by banks, corporations and stock markets, it has fallen from $1.17 to below $1 last year and to just 89 cents last week.
The decline has mystified analysts, mortified politicians, alarmed central bankers and reignited suspicions among those who never liked the idea of giving up their currencies.
''I believe we will have to pay dearly for the euro,'' said Rainer Forster, a 37-year-old electrician.
''The British haven't joined yet, and now it turns out that was pretty clever.''

Wim Duisenberg, the central bank president, said in his written statement on Friday, ''The euro's exchange rate has given rise to questions from European citizens who are concerned about the value of their currency.''
The implication that the bank might intervene cheered euro speculators, and the currency's value rose slightly against the dollar later in the day.
''I understand their concerns, since a persistently lower euro exchange rate might ultimately lead to higher prices in the shops,'' he added.
For now, though, some Europeans have felt almost cheated.
''There is a general feeling of unfairness,'' the French newspaper Le Monde said in an editorial.
''Does the United States deserve such a strong currency?
The dollar's superstar status demonstrates how well Washington is able to steer the international financial community into overlooking the weaknesses of the American economy.''
Europe is hardly in an economic crisis.
The euro countries are growing at a rate of about 3.4 percent this year, the fastest clip in years, and not that bad compared with the 4.5 percent expected for the United States.
While inflation is lower than in the United States, unemployment is still high at 9.6 percent.

Nor are volatile exchange rates anything new.
But the fallout from the euro's plunge is getting serious.
It has greatly strengthened the position of opponents in Britain, which will make it more difficult for Britain to adopt the currency.
Partly in response, conservative German politicians demanded last week that Greece be barred from adopting the euro for several years.
The economic consequences are beginning as well.
By making European goods cheaper in American dollars, the euro has fueled a boom in European exports, and that has propelled German economic growth, which is expected to more than double from last year.

But the euro has also created a deep economic wedge between Britain and the Continent.
The pound has risen just as sharply against the euro as the dollar, with devastating results for British manufacturers.
Thanks to the strong pound, British products are now expensive in continental Europe, and Britain is being flooded with low-priced imports from the Continent.
Jaguar, the luxury auto maker, has absorbed what amounts to a double-digit price decline in Germany to keep from losing market share.
So some Jaguar models in Germany cost less than in Britain.
British consumers, furious, have started a campaign called ''Rip-Off Britain'' to put pressure on companies that charge more for products in Britain than on the Continent.
But the big debate is about the reasons for the decline, which has confounded economists.
The most common explanation is that the American economy's remarkable boom has been an unprecedented magnet for money.
One common criticism of the euro-zone economies is that they have not yet deregulated their labor markets and reduced taxes.
Others point to conflicting signals from the European Central Bank.
''I admit that we have not always been equally successful in communicating our policy intentions to the public,'' Sirkka Haemaelaeinen, a member of the bank's executive board, conceded in a speech last week.

The problems may go deeper.
Economists note that the bank has been following a surprisingly loose monetary policy.
Not only are interest rates substantially lower in Europe than in the United States, but the supply of money has also consistently expanded faster than the central bank's own targets, hurting the euro's value.
So far, ordinary citizens have remained fairly relaxed.
Even many Germans, who treated the mark with almost religious reverence, seem patient.
''The euro's image is pretty bad right now, but I think it has been bad-mouthed,'' said Severin Fiebon, a 27-year-old bank worker in Frankfurt.
''The euro is still very young.''
Gerhard Bocke, a retired teacher here, said he has lived through big swings before.
''The exchange rate between the dollar and mark has changed so often,'' Mr. Bocke said on Thursday.
''It goes up, then it goes down.
I don't really care about it as long as I don't travel to America.''
The main problem with this novel is that Ms. Brown never makes Miriam's long-ago decision to abandon Veronica remotely plausible.
Why would Miriam -- who, we are repeatedly told, is a fiercely liberal-minded woman -- assent to her former boyfriend's argument that she would have difficulty, as a white woman, raising a child of mixed race?
Why did she allow 17 years to pass before making an effort to get in touch with Veronica or see how she was doing?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Though she makes vague allusions to Miriam's passivity and shame over having an out-of-wedlock child, Ms. Brown does not provide a persuasive explanation for her heroine's curious behavior.
As a result Miriam comes across as a curiously hardhearted woman: a wimp when it comes to fighting for the child she says she loves, a hypocrite when it comes to matters of race.
Miriam's behavior, once she has reacquainted herself with Veronica, is equally difficult to understand.
Ms. Brown writes that she feels ''a kind of liquid joy flooding her veins'' at the prospect of getting Veronica to press charges against a police officer for sexual harassment even though a lawyer tells her that the case is unwinnable, even though Veronica herself worries that such charges would expose her to terrible humiliation.
For Miriam, apparently, it is simply a chance to relive the civil rights actions she participated in as a young woman.

As for Veronica, she is often as unsympathetic as her mother.
She has decided to accept Miriam's overtures because she sees her as ''a cash cow'' who can bankroll her college education and acting ambitions.
She just has to work ''her way around to getting her hands on the keys to the safe,'' even if that means having to accept a hug here and there.
She sees Miriam, so eager to re-establish a mother-daughter bond, as ''desperation on toast.''
Certainly a compelling story might be told about two such difficult women trying to come to terms with each other, but Ms. Brown repeatedly subverts the emotional through-line of her narrative by setting up sentimental confrontations in which her characters discuss the color of their skin.
They consequently seem less like individuals reacting to the social pressures of the world around them than race-obsessed people parroting racial cliches.
When Veronica tells her father that she wants to go to Stanford, he asks her why she wants to go to ''White Folks' Heaven.''
When Veronica goes on a date with a white boy, she turns to him and says, ''So what can you tell me about black life in this wonderful country?''
And when one of Miriam's old friends from the civil rights days meets Veronica, she thinks, ''It was such a relief to see her brown-sugar skin'' in Miriam's house.
While passages devoted to the characters' daily routines are energized by the sort of emotional detail that distinguished Ms. Brown's earlier books, this novel frequently lapses into embarrassingly flabby romance novel prose.
Of Miriam's anger, Ms. Brown writes, it ''was building its bonfires on all sides of her, fed by the past, fed by the present, and there was no place in it finally, thank God, for tears.''
Such prose is uncharacteristic of the usually meticulous Ms. Brown, just as this novel feels like an uncharacteristic lapse in her career, a story told more as a melodramatic made-for-television movie than a heartfelt work of fiction.
UNEMPLOYMENT is now only 3.9 percent, its lowest level in 30 years.
The United States could not seem to compete with other industrial nations.
Today the crisis is a dim memory, and America's economy is the world's envy.
Yet schools are, at best, only marginally better, so prosperity cannot be the result of school reform.
That means schools were not to blame for the nation's earlier doldrums.
If we had recognized sooner the limited role schools play in determining economic success, would we have embarked on identical reforms?
Or would education policy have been less politicized, with more tolerance for experimentation?
Most economists then feared that attempts to lower unemployment would spur inflation.
President Clinton's first appointees to the Federal Reserve, Alan Blinder and Janet Yellen, supported Dr. Greenspan's tighter money policies, aimed at keeping joblessness from falling.
Faster growth could not eliminate such transitions.
Other workers wanting jobs were too poorly educated to be hired.
Growth could not help them either, because they lacked minimum skills.
Inflation, not more jobs, would follow.
Unemployment could drop further only if schools improved to make graduates more attractive hires.

Today, with unemployment less than 4 percent, many formerly jobless high school dropouts have found jobs.
Unemployment has plummeted, even for the most vulnerable, black teenagers.
Perhaps America has now reached a point where growth should be slowed.
Economists attribute today's growth with mild inflation not to improved schools, but to factors like greater efficiency, downward price pressure from growing imports and a willingness to experiment with lower interest rates.
But Dr. Greenspan has not wavered.
Before initiating the current round of interest rate increases last year, he told the Congressional Joint Economic Committee that ''we fall far short'' in public education.
The nation cannot maintain prosperity, he said, if schools do not improve.
In 1992, Prof. Lester C. Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published the best-selling book ''Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, America and Europe'' (William Morrow).
It predicted that Europe would ''own the 21st century,'' partly because poor schools make America uncompetitive.
''To create the productivity that can justify high wages,'' Dr. Thurow said, ''American K-12 education will have to improve.''

But since then, American productivity has soared, wages have recovered and America's economy has left Japan's and Europe's in the dust.
It seems that today's productivity growth stems from years of accumulated innovation, and that American schools do, after all, produce a work force with adequate skills to use new technologies.
But curiously, reputations of mistaken analysts have not been sullied, while the damage they did to the reputation of education's role in the American economy has endured.
Perhaps we would have wanted similar cures, even after diagnoses were altered.
Even in a healthy economy, we should improve the ability of less advantaged students to compete for better jobs.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 168.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,367.78, with Intel, down 10 7/8, to 106 1/16, accounting for about one-third of the slide.

Elsewhere, Cisco Systems, which reported slightly better-than-expected quarterly results after the close of the market on Tuesday, slumped 4 1/4, to 58 1/2, as investors focused on the company's doubts about being able to get all the components it needs to set up networks.
And Motorola lost 18 7/16, to 86 1/2, after a Salomon Smith Barney analyst cut his rating, noting difficulties in getting components for its cellular phones.
It is down 5.9 percent this year, compared with losses of 9.8 percent for the Dow and 16.8 percent for Nasdaq.
''The trend has dramatically changed'' in recent weeks, said Ronald Shear, chief executive of the Carlin Equities Group, a trading-oriented firm heavily involved with Nasdaq stocks.

And few seemed optimistic that the skid, which has taken 33 percent off the Nasdaq since its high of 5,048.62 on March 10, has run its course.
But he said he was preparing for a resumption of rising prices during the summer after the Fed has finished raising rates, probably at its June 27 meeting.
''We're advising getting ready for the second half, getting ready to buy'' stocks like regional banks, Mr. Berdine said.
He added that he would retain technology shares, concentrating on infrastructure companies and avoiding those that are purely Internet.
In the interview, Mr. Frankel never directly denied the charges against him, which include fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and racketeering.

Instead, he said that a life sentence, which he could receive, would violate ''human dignity and human rights.''
Appearing on camera with a scraggly beard and silver-rimmed glasses askew, the 45-year-old former stockbroker offered a defiant case for leniency, saying that his supposed crimes were only financial.
''There is no violence,'' he said.
''No one is murdered.
No one is killed.
No one is physically harmed.''
United States prosecutors say that Mr. Frankel built an elaborate criminal empire using a financial trust, a brokerage house and a Catholic charity with links to the Vatican as fronts to buy small Southern insurance companies, which he then drained of more than $200 million in assets.
From his Greenwich, Conn., home, he used the money to buy luxury cars, fur coats for his girlfriends, and eventually $16 million in diamonds and gold to finance his flight through Europe, according to a 36-count indictment issued last October by the United States Attorney's office in Connecticut.
While Mr. Frankel declined to discuss the specific charges against him during the interview, his remarks offer a curious psychological portrait of an alternately grandiose, glib and self-pitying figure.
''Under German law,'' he said, ''no human being arrested in Germany can be sent back to a country where they will either execute him, or put him in jail for the rest of his life.''
One of his German lawyers, Dirk Meinicke, when reached by phone in Hamburg, said of Mr. Frankel's statement, ''It's his opinion.''

A high state court in Hamburg has approved Mr. Frankel's extradition, but Mr. Frankel must first stand trial next month on charges of passport fraud and customs-tax evasion.

Conditions in the jail, where Mr. Frankel spends his days alone in a cell, wearing the same blue shirt and khakis in which he was arrested, are far from the conspicuous luxury of his past life.
For six years, he ran a stock-trading business from his mansion, hiring submissive female companions to do office work, indulge his taste for sado-masochistic sex, and bait potential business partners.
He also notes death threats and attempts at blackmail by various colleagues alongside notes about bizarre sexual acts, scheduled haircuts and visits to his mother in Toledo, Ohio.
He said: ''The most hungry people we fed.
Yes, we fed some of the most hungry people in the world.''
Last May, after failing to appease state regulators, Mr. Frankel fled the country, leaving documents ablaze in his house.
During the last eight months -- while he has struggled in jail with dental problems and tried, unsuccessfully to get kosher food, according to his lawyers -- his legal troubles have only deepened.
At least three of his former associates have cooperated with federal prosecutors, providing information about Mr. Frankel's transactions.
''I am not a financial genius,'' he said, laughing and shaking his head during the ABC interview.
''If a financial genius would end up in here, then they're not a genius by definition.''
In victory, they would have been patriots.
Three decades later, they wait still.
But for what?
Now, many are unsure they would go even if they had the chance.
Steeped in inertia, enmeshed in poverty, they are waiting because waiting is what they do.
Even the most stalwart now wonder whether they have sacrificed their lives to a sad folly.
''Look at me -- I am going to die here,'' said Muhammad Jainul Abedin, a frail 70-year-old.
He lives in a camp in Rangpur, a small city in the northwest.
A stroke has disabled his arm.
His spirit suffers a paralysis as well.
''Who thought we would spend 30 years living in a filthy camp?''
Mr. Abedin's son, Muhammad Zabed, was standing near.
Like most families, they live in a cramped shack, their small space reconfigured into tinier nooks with the marriage of every son and the birth of each baby.
Surreally, on one wall they have hung posters of elegant American farmhouses, with broad porches behind white picket fences.
''They make the room look beautiful,'' Mr. Zabed said.
''Of course, once you walk outside, you are back in the filth.''
The government provides the camps free electricity, water and a ration of wheat.
The camps are not prisons.
People can move out, though few do.
Without money, they say, there is no way to make a fresh start.
They have grown used to their limbo, waiting futilely as Bangladesh and Pakistan figure out which is to keep them.
''These two countries, they each try to throw the ball -- or should I say the people -- into the other's court,'' said Muhammad Mohi-Us Sunnah, the legal officer for the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.
''It's quite pitiful, really.
And no one seems to be doing anything about it.''

The stranded Pakistanis do not qualify under the United Nations definition of refugees.
They are waiting to flee, but have not yet fled.

Ever since, the ''repatriation'' has suffered fits and starts -- mostly fits.

Political instability in Pakistan has been a major hindrance.
Elected officials and military rulers change places with immoderate frequency.
Ethnic distemper pervades Karachi, the presumed spot where many of the Biharis would relocate.
And Pakistanis who migrated from India are considered troublemakers by much of the establishment.

The longtime leader of the stranded Pakistanis is Nasim Khan.
He is 77, a white-haired man with a heart condition and cataracts.
For three decades, he has fed his followers on a chimera.
They have flown the Pakistani flag and celebrated the Pakistani holidays.
Most people in Bangladesh -- even in the camps, the government, the news media -- think Mr. Khan still clings to a dream of deliverance.
But his ideas seem to have taken a somersault.
In a recent interview, he said, ''Pakistan is not the land of honey and milks.''
Indeed, he now concludes that the stranded Pakistanis would be better off as naturalized Bangladeshis, especially if they can negotiate a ''package deal'' with reparations for lost property.
The thinking of the leaders seems to be catching up to that of the followers.
In an informal survey, C. R. Abrar, who heads a research project on migratory movements at Dhaka University, found that 60 to 70 percent of those in the camps would now prefer a permanent home in Bangladesh.
''My future is gone, but what about theirs?
Our lives have been one big misunderstanding.''
People were asked: would you prefer to live in Pakistan or Bangladesh?
With their leader looking on, the stranded performed dutifully.
And yet now he softly said, ''Why do we need to go to Pakistan?''
Correction Appended

THE European Central Bank has not been the best friend of the beleaguered euro over its 16 1/2-month life.
The confusing signals that bank officials have sent about the euro, the unified currency of 11 European nations, have clearly contributed to its 21 percent decline against the dollar.
And while hints of European Central Bank intervention to support the euro helped it rally last week, to 91.96 cents as of Friday, it remains near its record low of 89.48 cents, reached on May 3.
Several American currency analysts still expect the euro to fall as low as 85 cents.
So where can Europeans turn for help?
Try the United States Federal Reserve, whose policy makers on Tuesday are expected to raise their short-term interest rate target for the sixth time since last June.
The only debate is whether the rate increase will be a quarter of a percentage point, like the previous five, or a half-point, in response to recent signs of inflationary pressure.
How could Fed action help Europe?
There are several possible scripts, some of which have the euro continuing to fall -- and the dollar continuing to rise -- in the near term.
But longer term, if it finally becomes clear that the Fed is not only determined to slow the American economy but that it is also accomplishing that goal, then the dollar will lose its lift against the euro.
And that is important for American investors who have bet on European stocks.
The euro's plunge this year has turned almost all of Europe's stock market gains to minuses for American investors.
One possibility is probably best for the euro: a half-point increase in interest rates by the Fed.
That would help cement the view that the Fed will not stop raising rates until the annual pace of economic growth slows in the United States from the 5 percent pace of the last four quarters to something closer to 3 or 3.5 percent.

The Fed could underline that message with a statement that ''the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.''
Repeating it would signal that there are more rate increases to come.
Adding to the market tension on Tuesday will be the government report on the Consumer Price Index for April.
Another high number would increase inflation fears, making investors even more leery of future rate increases.

Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Securities, said a high consumer price number and a half-point rate increase would suggest that the United States economy was headed for a hard landing -- and equities would take a hit.
Further stock market declines could help break the confidence of European investors in the American market, meaning they would sell American stocks and convert their dollars back to euros.
In the longer term, the slowing of growth in the United States, in comparison with Europe, is what will weaken the dollar and strengthen the euro.
''More convincing than ever is the notion that the United States economy is going to slow,'' said James McCormick, currency strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities.
''If the Fed goes half a percentage point and comes up with a strong statement, that is telling you that the growth is going to slow.''
That does not mean the euro will turn on a dime.
Mr. McCormick expects the euro to fall to 86 cents, because direct European investment in the United States is strong, and there are no sure signs yet that the American economy is slowing.
But one month's numbers do not a trend make.
Still, an American investor who believes that the euro can turn in the months ahead would do well to buy European stocks now -- they are cheaper when the dollar is stronger -- and then get the benefit when the euro rallies, making European stocks more valuable in dollar terms.

column, about the prospects for the euro amid rising interest rates in the United States, carried an incorrect scale label.
With much fanfare, the press is building the suspense around tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee.
Will the Fed raise the short-term interest rate by a quarter point or will it -- gasp!
-- go for a half?
One might think the committee was facing a contentious decision whose resolution could affect the course of economic history.
Actually, conducting monetary policy right now is a no-brainer.
The economy is growing too fast, and the Federal Reserve needs to keep raising the short-term rate -- the only instrument it has -- until growth slows to a more sustainable pace.
Whether the committee raises the rate by a quarter-point tomorrow or a half or even more has little economic significance.
The choice is tactical: how best to send a message to businesses, investors and consumers to slow things down a bit so the economic engine can keep moving forward without overheating.
That much of the attention has been focused on the size of the rate increase highlights the fact that few disagree that tightening the economy is appropriate right now.
Some critics, especially in Europe, even believe the Fed has not moved aggressively enough to rein in what they regard as a fragile bubble economy, based more on equity speculation than solid growth.
But the remarkable productivity increases of the last three years are in fact solid.
They are based on rapid technological change, and tight labor markets have clearly opened enormous opportunities to workers at all levels.
If the Fed had raised rates sooner or faster, some benefits of the digital economy might have been delayed and many people would have been worse off.
Other critics regard all interest rate increases as pernicious and dismiss the risks to future expansion from incipient inflation, extreme worker scarcity and consumer spending out of paper wealth.
They argue that economists used to say that unemployment rates below 5 percent, or growth rates over 3 percent, would cause inflation, but those limits have been breached for some time without ill effect, so why not push unemployment down to 3 percent and growth up to 6?

That the United States economy can, under favorable conditions, drive safely at high speeds, does not prove that it is safe at any speed, even when the road worsens.
Congress and the stock market have helped keep the economy in check.
Congress, in not acting to reduce the mounting federal surplus by devoting the money to big tax cuts or major new spending programs, has helped slow the economy in the short run.
And the recent drop in the stock market has also helped keep the economy from growing out of control.
It seems that investors are remembering that earnings, or the firm prospect of earnings, ought to have some influence on stock values.
An additional market correction would help, but even if equity prices just wander sideways for a while, consumer spending is still likely to weaken and help ward off inflation.
So, stay in your seats.
Tomorrrow's Fed decision won't change the course of history.
But with any luck it will help to keep the economy growing at a healthy and sustainable clip.
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.
The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity.
The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid rate and hiring appears to have picked up.
Although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher, long-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well contained.
The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.
Similarly, the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance.
At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.

The Higher Education Act of 1965, due to be re-authorized by Congress this fall, was meant to ensure that no academically qualified American would be barred from college for financial reasons alone.
But the door has been steadily closing, thanks to soaring tuition costs and declining student aid.
A federal commission estimates that up to 4.4 million Americans will be turned away from four-year colleges for financial reasons in this decade alone.
House Republicans have suggested changes in the law that would make things worse.
Their bill would fail to increase federal Pell grants, which covered more than 80 percent of the average public-college tuition for the poorest students a quarter-century ago but covers only about 40 percent today.
Without a long-overdue increase for Pell grants, everything else amounts to tinkering at the margins.
Meanwhile, the bill would increase students' debts by wiping out a provision that allows students to consolidate their loans at a fixed low rate.
That provision would benefit private lenders, which are eager to charge whatever the market will bear, and would burden students by driving up interest rates.
On the plus side, the bill would require banks to return a portion of their excess profits on student loans to the government.
But it ducks a much more important reform: replacing the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which unnecessarily enriches the banks, with a direct loan program that would allow students to borrow directly from the government.
This would save billions of dollars that could then flow to student aid, not the banks.

In this case, everyone in the food industry seems to want nothing more than to educate consumers, especially young ones, to make good choices.
Anyone who has watched commercial children's television -- where the majority of the ads hawk food of dubious nutritional merit -- has seen such education in action.
There is a funny, revealing sequence in which Mr. Spurlock goes to several McDonald's restaurants in search of posters and handouts with nutritional information and discovers that they are difficult to find and sometimes not available at all.
There is a heartbreaking moment when an overweight girl worries that she will never lose weight because she can't afford to eat two sandwiches a day from Subway, the diet that made Jared Fogle into the chain's favorite spokesman.

There are also interviews (some conducted over cheeseburgers and soft drinks) with nutritionists, lawyers and David Satcher, the former surgeon general of the United States, all of whom raise alarm about heart disease, juvenile diabetes and other scourges of a society built on cheap, convenient and abundant calories.
The arguments in ''Super Size Me'' will be familiar to readers of Eric Schlosser's best-selling ''Fast Food Nation,'' and like that book, Mr. Spurlock's film is as much about corporate power as it is about health.
His conclusion is that it's us or them, that we should kill McDonald's before McDonald's kills us.
This may be a little melodramatic, but it should nonetheless give you pause.
In any case, it seems more likely that we will continue to live in a fast-food world, perhaps more warily (and more queasily) in the wake of Mr. Spurlock's experience.

The stock and bond markets, apparently viewing the job numbers as firm evidence that the recovery is gathering steam, braced for an increase in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet in late June.
Several Wall Street economists who had argued that the Fed would not act until after the November presidential election revised their forecasts yesterday, asserting that if the Fed does not act by June, it surely will by August.

Since then, economic output has advanced at an annual rate of 5.5 percent, and to keep up with the rising demand, employers finally began easing up on layoffs and started to fill slots.
Since midsummer, they have added 1.1 million jobs, a majority in the last two months.

For starters, many companies have brought in temporary workers rather than full-timers, and the ranks of temp workers continued to swell last month, up 35,000 over March.
Employment also rose smartly in April in health care, restaurant work and in industries related to the booming housing sector -- architectural services, real estate firms, mortgage banking, landscaping, building material stores and construction, the latter adding 18,000 workers in April and 83,000 since January.

Manufacturing employment, up 21,000 in April, got nearly half of that job growth in fabricated metals.

But for all the improvement in jobs, the slack in the labor market is clearly evident not only in the failure of the unemployment rate to fall significantly -- it has been stuck at 5.6 or 5.7 percent since December -- but also in relatively weak wage growth, which has not kept pace with inflation.
Moreover, there has been little improvement in the number of long-term unemployed -- those who have been looking for work for 27 weeks or more -- or in the reluctance to hire the college-educated.
Of the 8.2 million people who listed themselves in the monthly job survey as unemployed and looking for work, 1.8 million in April have been doing this for 27 weeks or more.
That total came down by 188,000 from March, but the long-term unemployed are still a historically high 22 percent of all the unemployed.
The percentage of the adult population holding jobs ticked up to 62.2 percent in April from 61.1 percent in March and has held roughly at that level most of this year.
But the gains have gone mostly to men and women with some college training, usually at community colleges, but less than a four-year bachelor's degree.

RUNNING alongside the Shepaug River in Washington, Conn., under a canopy of hemlock and hardwoods, there's a path so flat and cindery it could be nothing else but an abandoned railbed.
Still, the ghosts of steam engines don't really act up until you enter a crude tunnel, blasted through 180 feet of solid rock by someone in a hurry to move trains from daylight to daylight.
It is a dank place to be, and vaguely threatening, as if the 2:09 might yet come bearing down on you.
In walks there over the years, I'm afraid I never took the time to find out.
With a journalistic regard for detail and the fly fisherman's habit of patient observation, he has worked the answers into a smart, quietly ambitious narrative of people's impact on the well-worn Connecticut environment, and vice versa, since early colonial settlement.
''The Trout Pool Paradox'' covers a lot of ground -- Thomas Jefferson's nice coat, the life cycle of Atlantic salmon -- but always returns to three rivers: the Housatonic and, more hauntingly, its two main tributaries, the photogenic Shepaug and the trashy Naugatuck.

Mr.
A Citigroup spokeswoman, when asked if the bank was reconsidering past pay packages, responded by reiterating Mr.

''Everybody had expected that this thing would stay in court for four or five years and at the end of that time frame the loss would have been much smaller,'' said Richard Bove, a banking analyst with Hoefer & Arnett.
''Even though Citigroup is not admitting any guilt by settling in this fashion, from my perspective, they have admitted guilt.
And that is chastening, because in my opinion I hadn't really thought they were guilty.

''What they're saying with the settlement is that they had acted improperly and it didn't make any sense to fight this thing over the next five years in court, spend a huge amount of money, and lose this thing in the end,'' he added.
Citigroup's sheer size and extraordinary profitability, which are big elements of Mr. Weill's legacy, allow it to digest these charges without being crippled.

Mr. Teets, the analyst with A.G. Edwards, said that Wall Street was hoping to see these businesses make up a ''bigger and bigger piece'' of Cisco's overall revenue.

''As the economy continues to grow and investment picks up, this will only intensify U.S. demand for foreign oil,'' said Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at the MG Financial Group.
Rising oil prices have become a chief concern of the Bush administration, and they are receiving increased scrutiny at the Federal Reserve.
Senior Fed officials have estimated that a price increase of $10 a barrel could reduce American economic growth by about one-half of a percentage point.

But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has said that rising oil prices are less likely than in the 1970's to lead to higher inflation because energy now accounts for a smaller part of the overall economy and because inflation expectations are much lower.

Thus far, investors have shown little concern about the United States' rising deficit or its rising level of foreign indebtedness.

The sharp decline of the dollar against the euro and other major currencies has helped American exports by making them cheaper in foreign currencies.
''The global trade imbalances are going to remain large,'' Mr. Levy said.
''They are not going to go away.''
But wait: basic economics says that markets deal handily with excesses of demand over supply.
Prices rise, producers have an incentive to produce more while consumers have an incentive to consume less, and the market comes back into balance.
Won't that happen with oil?

Yes, it will.
The question is how long it will take, and how high prices will go in the meantime.
To see the problem, think about gasoline.
Sustained high gasoline prices lead to more fuel-efficient cars: by 1990 the average American vehicle got 40 percent more miles per gallon than in 1973.
But replacing old cars with new takes years.
In their initial response to a shortfall in the gasoline supply, people must save gas by driving less, something they do only in the face of very, very high prices.
So very, very high prices are what we'll get.
Increasing production capacity takes even longer than replacing old cars.
Also, major new discoveries of oil have become increasingly rare (although in my last column on the subject, I forgot about two large fields in Kazakhstan, one discovered in 1979, the second in 2000).

Petroleum engineers continue to squeeze more oil out of known fields, but a repeat of the post-1973 experience, in which there was a big increase in non-OPEC production, seems unlikely.
So oil prices will stay high, and may go higher even in the absence of more bad news from the Middle East.
And with more bad news, we'll be looking at a real crisis -- one that could do a lot of economic damage.
Each $10 per barrel increase in crude prices is like a $70 billion tax increase on American consumers, levied through inflation.
The spurt in producer prices last month was a taste of what will happen if prices stay high.

Largely because of that quirk, the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy and is the rate that the Fed's policy makers watch closely, rose more than the overall inflation rate.
''Something we did not expect to happen has happened,'' said Lawrence Meyer, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Fed governor, noting the surprisingly strong inflation of the last four months.
But Mr. Meyer and many other forecasters argue that this view is now wishful thinking.
''We have removed the ability to be patient any longer about inflation,'' Mr. Meyer said.

At its current level, the core inflation rate is approaching the 2 percent figure that many analysts describe as a limit, set by the Fed, that cannot be exceeded without forcing the central bank to raise the pivotal short-term interest rate that it controls.
That rate, which in turn affects interest rates on home mortgages, car loans and other consumer credit, has been at a 46-year low of 1 percent since last June.

The April data follow a surprising 0.5 percent surge in the price index in March that had signaled, for the first time, that inflation was clearly on the upswing.
A rapidly growing economy, starting last summer, is contributing to the upward pressure on prices.
So are rising commodity prices, especially for steel, and the falling value of the dollar against other currencies.
The dollar's decline means that import prices are no longer falling.
That gives American companies an opportunity to raise their prices with less fear that foreign competitors will undercut them.

One result of these favorable economic winds has been an upturn in industrial production, especially in manufacturing.
Even so, the figure means that nearly 23 percent of the nation's production facilities were still idle, enough to avoid inflationary shortages in most sectors of the economy.
''My sense is that it is hard to see how the inflation rate can stay this high,'' said Lee Price, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a research house.
''It is not uncommon to have an energy spike that, like a pig in a python, works its way through and the inflation rate then subsides.''
But fuel prices show no sign of subsiding.

Gasoline prices have played a central role in the inflation story.
In the bureau's calculation, in fact, the seasonal adjustment translated into a 0.3 percent drop in gasoline prices.
The temporary reprieve will almost certainly disappear in May, however, because of an unusually rapid increase in pump prices in late April and early May, according to the Energy Department.
Housing costs, the biggest single item in the C.P.I.
Rent plays a significant role in determining housing costs, the theory being that rent is a proxy for what homeowners must spend.
But here, too, the data may be misleading, according to Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who argues that vacancy rates are high for rental units.
''The acceleration in rental inflation appears to be driven entirely by higher rents in the Northeast,'' Mr. Baker said.
And any stock declines within these six episodes were relatively small, when calculated from the starting point.
The biggest came during that 1986-89 period, which includes the 1987 crash: a fall of 9.8 percent in the S.&P.

But after the Fed pledged to keep the benchmark rate low ''for a considerable period,'' the path of Treasury yields reversed, with the yield on the 10-year note falling to 3.68 percent in March of this year.

So if the Fed decides in June to adopt its first rate increase since May 2000, the policy makers will have to remind investors of the pledge they made this month to be ''measured'' in raising their benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks.

''Measured'' probably means four quarter-point rate increases by the end of this year and two more in the first six months of 2005.
But the rising rate of inflation could make Fed restraint difficult.
At the moment, Fed officials don't seem very concerned about inflation, although it has accelerated this year, with consumer prices up at an annual rate of 4.4 percent through April.
That speedup has prompted some analysts to argue that the Fed is not moving fast enough to stem the price tide.
Investors would worry that policy makers would try to catch up with bigger and faster rate increases, bringing back memories of the surge in rates in 1994.
Still, 1994 was not as bad for stocks as some memories might suggest.

History is on the Fed's side.
But with inflation bubbling, the job of calming investors will not be easy.
''The Federal Reserve has been behind the curve,'' said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, an investment firm in Chicago.
''With G.D.P.
growth at a 20-year high, with inflation pressures rising, there is no justification for keeping rates this low.
In my opinion, they should have started raising rates last year.''

Fed officials have been hinting for months that they will have to increase interest rates, and all evidence suggests that they will begin the process with a quarter-point rise in short-term rates at their next policy meeting on June 28-29.
Senior Fed officials are quietly pleased that bond market investors have already anticipated rate increases by pushing up mortgage rates and yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes to the highest levels in nearly two years.
Officials hope that the advance rise in long-term rates will cool the economy even before they take any action, making their job easier.
''Monetary conditions in the United States are already in the process of normalizing,'' remarked Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, in a speech last month.
As a result of the Fed's communications strategy, he continued, ''market rates have generally responded continuously and in a stabilizing manner.''

But analysts said the bond markets were affected more by evidence of rising employment and faster inflation than by the Fed's hints.

''I don't think you should give the Fed's communications much credit for the tightening in financial markets,'' said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor who is now a senior economic adviser at Schwab Soundview Capital Markets.
''You should give credit to the markets for correctly interpreting the numbers that have been indicating that the economy is stronger than expected and that prices were increasing.''

Federal Reserve officials and private economists all agree that short-term rates are too low to sustain much longer.
At its current rate of 1 percent, the Federal funds rate on overnight loans is at it's the lowest level since 1958.
The ''real'' interest rate, after accounting for inflation, is negligible at a time the economy is growing.

Jittery bond investors have been gearing up for higher rates for more than a year, but Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, was until recently more worried about high unemployment and a prospect of deflation.
In an effort to keep long-term interest rates down, the central bank took the unusual step last year of declaring that it would keep the benchmark federal funds rate low ''for a considerable period.''
It backed away from that pledge in January, saying only that it would be patient, and then again in May by saying that future rate increases would be ''measured.''
The Fed appears determined to avoid the experience of 10 years ago, when it raised rates more sharply than investors had been expecting, jolting the markets.
They were raising rates with virtually no evidence of inflation, and the Fed was having to do back flips to justify its actions.
In the current environment, we've gotten an upturn in the trend of inflation.
There is no way it can be characterized now as pre-emptive.''

Mr. Greenspan has thus far taken a different view on inflation.
Even if wages did rise, he added, corporate profits have been so high in the last year that businesses are more likely to absorb the costs than risk losing market share.
Lawrence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now a senior adviser at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm, said, ''The Fed has a very benign interpretation about inflation, and the markets have a much more pessimistic view.''

The big question is how much the Federal Reserve will raise short-term rates before it decides that monetary policy is no longer encouraging inflation.
If inflation settles around 2 percent a year, that would imply that the benchmark short-term rate would eventually have to reach nearly 5 percent -- a huge increase from 1 percent now.
Mr. Greenspan and other top officials have made clear that they have no plan to rush to those levels.
But economists caution that the Fed's hand could be forced if consumer prices keep rising at the pace of the last few months.

Since the defeat of the pro-reform government of Atal Behari Vajpayee last week, India's markets have been on edge and have lost considerable ground.

Investors, including foreign institutions that had put a few billion dollars into Indian equities this year, were alarmed by the fact that Mrs. Gandhi's Congress party would need the support of the left-leaning parties to gain a majority in the 545-member Indian parliament.
Leaders of some of the Communist parties said that they would vehemently oppose the sale of state-owned companies.
''Markets prefer Manmohan Singh; the opposition will not be so uncooperative, politics will not be ugly,'' said Ketan Sheth, director at the brokerage firm Way2Wealth Securities.

Dr. Singh, an economist by training, set off the liberalization process in 1991 as finance minister.
He has also served as head of India's central bank and is credited with rescuing the country from a currency crisis.
His policies loosening India from its socialist roots came to be known as Manmohanomics.
Underscoring the strong fundamentals of the economy, the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, kept interest rates steady at a three-decade low of 6 percent on Tuesday, and projected economic growth of 6.5 percent to 7 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2005.
After Monday's biggest-ever 17 percent intraday slump in the Sensex, brokers and investors led a protest in India's financial capital of Mumbai, blaming Mrs. Gandhi for the stock market crash.

Representative Jon Porter, the Nevada Republican who is the bill's sponsor, said: ''I don't think the question is defining middle, low or high.
We're trying to give money to families.
It's about helping as many children as we can.''
House Republican leaders are expected to bring the bill up for a vote on Thursday, and it is expected to pass.
But the bill's chances of becoming law are far more doubtful, because it is ensnared in a much broader impasse over tax cuts that paralyze House and Senate Republicans.

The key budget battle is whether new tax cuts, including the expanded child tax credit, should be subject to a ''pay-as-you-go'' requirement under which lawmakers would have to offset the lost revenue with either spending cuts or other tax increases.

The House, voting 216 to 213, narrowly passed a compromise budget resolution on Wednesday that would essentially allow Congress to extend several of last year's tax cuts, including the child tax credit, for one year.

House Republicans fumed in exasperation at the Republican holdouts.
''I can't believe that one or two members, particularly Republican members of the the Senate, would hold up such an incredible budget,'' said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader.
''For what?
To make it more difficult to give tax relief to the American public.''
''Our members will not be tied down.''

The House bill to expand the child tax credit could easily heighten the tension.
Senate Republicans are struggling simply to keep the existing child tax credit from expiring at the end of this year.
House Republicans are pushing to expand it, with additional benefits for some low-income families but a much bigger expansion for high-income families.

Democrats and other critics of the expansion said it would increase the federal budget deficit while benefitting the nation's wealthiest families.
''What they are doing is digging a much deeper fiscal hole for all families in our country in order to help a relatively small number of families who aren't in any kind of need,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan.

The House bill would also help lower-income families, allowing many who do not pay any federal taxes to get a tax rebate in 2004.
But the child tax credit would remain entirely unavailable to families with incomes below $10,500.
David Harris, president of the Children's Research and Education Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group in New York City, estimated that about 8 million children are in families with incomes below $10,500 and would not qualify for any tax credit at all.

''We agree that the child tax credit needs to reach more children, but they should start with those at the bottom instead of those at the top,'' Mr. Harris said.
The Bush administration, increasingly desperate just to get House and Senate agreement on a budget resolution, declined to comment on expanding the child tax credit.
President Bush will travel to Capitol Hill on Thursday in an effort to persuade Republican holdouts to change their views.

Over the years, the Iraqi National Congress has received about $33 million from the State Department, according to a new General Accounting Office report.
Other officials say Mr. Chalabi's group was more accurate in identifying the whereabouts of former Saddam Hussein loyalists.
That year a group of influential conservatives wrote an ''Open Letter'' to President Bill Clinton calling for ''regime change'' in Iraq to become the official policy of the United States.
And the letter stated clearly that the United States should ''recognize a provisional government of Iraq based on the principles and leaders of the Iraqi National Congress (I.N.C.)
that is representative of all the peoples of Iraq.''
''Saddam isn't going to be overthrown by a bunch of guys with briefcases in London,'' Samuel R. Berger, then the national security adviser, once said.
Others noted his conviction for defrauding his bank in Jordan 12 years ago; Mr. Chalabi and his supporters say he was framed.
He became a master of the art of the leak, giving new currency to the suspicions about Mr. Hussein's weapons.

Richard N. Perle, one of his strongest supporters here, another signatory of the letter, and a highly influential figure in defense circles, alluded to that Thursday after calling the raid on the Iraqi National Congress operations ''bizarre.''
''It is far from obvious how we advance American interests by acting against someone who shares our values and is highly effective,'' Mr. Perle said in an interview.
''They have gone in recent days, at the C.I.A.
and the State Department, from saying he has no influence in Iraq to a panic that he is really quite effective and could emerge with great influence'' when the occupation ends.
He predicted that ''the crude nature of this action will actually have the reverse effect, and bolster Ahmad.''
Among Mr. Chalabi's other vociferous defenders over the last three years have been Vice President Dick Cheney and Mr. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, who could often be overheard describing Mr. Chalabi's love of both the Iraqi people and the land he left at age 13.
But both men were careful never to state outright what role they thought Mr. Chalabi should play, beyond a confidence he would rise to the top.

The Bush administration is looking for a scapegoat.''

With international inspectors recently reporting that North Korea may have shipped uranium, already processed into a gas that can be fed into centrifuges for enrichment into bomb fuel, the White House has been silent.
On Sunday, a White House spokesman declined to talk about the reports, other than to issue a statement at the president's ranch in Texas that the news proves the need for ''the United States policy for North Korea to disarm in a complete, verifiable and irreversible fashion.''
In North Korea, he said, Mr. Bush has virtually none.
Even hawks within the administration -- a group led by Vice President Dick Cheney, who said on a trip to Asia last month that ''time is not necessarily on our side'' -- see no major risk that North Korea will lash out at its neighbors or the United States.
The country is broke; American military officials say it can barely afford the jet fuel to give its fighter pilots time to train.

In short, if the North's sales to Libya are confirmed, the nightmare that Mr. Bush discussed so often last year -- the sale of ''the world's worst weapons to the world's most dangerous dictators'' -- may be happening at the other end of the axis.

Mr. Bush has addressed the issue chiefly through an agreement among a growing number of nations to intercept suspected shipments of illegal weapons, nuclear parts or chemical precursors.
The United States, Germany and Italy stopped a shipment of nuclear equipment to Libya last year, apparently convincing Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to give up his nuclear program.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Beyond the interception strategy, there is a widespread sense in Washington that neither the Bush administration nor North Korea has much incentive to confront the nuclear issue this year.
Mr. Bush, notes Don Oberdorfer, the author of ''The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History'' (Basic Books, 2002), is not ''prepared to do anything about North Korea because he is overcommitted in Iraq and has a great loathing of dealing with the North Koreans directly.''
The result, Mr. Oberdorfer argues, is that the United States is not ''making the kind of preliminary compromises that would be necessary to get a negotiation going.''
Administration officials disagree, saying that North Korea should not be rewarded for cheating on its past nuclear agreements and must begin dismantling weapons before it sees any economic benefits.
So far this has been a prescription for stalemate.
But many in the administration agree that Mr. Kim has his own reasons for not seeking a deal this year: the North Korean leader is presumed to be rooting for Mr. Bush's defeat in November, in hopes he will face a more willing negotiating partner in John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee.

The risk is that by the time the two countries re-engage, North Korea could have six or eight more weapons, according to the most dire estimates in the C.I.A.
and the Defense Intelligence Agency, a view that more cautious intelligence analysts say is based more on conjecture about the North's engineering skills than any real intelligence.
Such a number could let the North keep one or two for its own use, and have more to sell, in whole or parts, which is a very different position.

Japanese finance officials were encouraged by the progress banks made pruning bad loans from their portfolios.
The government has set a goal for banks to reduce bad loans to about 4 percent of their total lending by next March, and analysts say all four banks would likely clear that goal.
''The disposal of nonperforming loans is progressing,'' Shokichi Takagi, head of the Financial Services Agency, told reporters.
''The ratio of nonperforming loans is falling steadily.''

Progress on bad loans notwithstanding, analysts say that the banks face huge challenges in building profits.
Banks are trying to make up for the decline in their corporate lending businesses by expanding home mortgages, loans to small companies and by setting up corporate consulting services.

In March, the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group announced that it would spend 138 billion yen to acquire a 15 percent stake in consumer-loan specialist Acom to gain greater access to the high-margin consumer finance business.
Traditionally, big Japanese banks have stayed away from consumer finance, which in Japan is seen as a somewhat seedy business.
And this reliance on stock gains as a source of profits makes the banks vulnerable to a market downturn, Naoko Nemoto, an analyst at Standard & Poor's in Tokyo, warned.
Banks have ''overcome the most difficult time,'' she said, ''but they remain very, very vulnerable.''

Noise-cancellation technology has been in development for more than 50 years, Dr. Sommerfeldt said.
In typical headphones, microphones in the headset detect noise; the speakers in the earcups counter with anti-noise.

Dr. Sommerfeldt's target was not the roar of aircraft, but the hum of office machinery.
To counter this noise, some active noise reduction systems place microphones and related gear in the middle of a room to calculate the amount of cancellation needed.
But Dr. Sommerfeldt wanted to put the system within the computer casing itself so that it might one day become a built-in feature of personal computers.
Trying to cancel noise from within the computer turned out to be tricky, though.
''You are asking for trouble if you place the mikes right next to the fan,'' he said.
While it may be possible to reduce the sound substantially at the microphone, he said, the noise level could increase farther away, where someone might be sitting.

To solve the problem, Dr. Sommerfeldt built an aluminum enclosure that mimicked a typical computer chassis and put a standard cooling fan within.
He and his students placed microphones and speakers around the fan, analyzing the nature of the sounds they would have to suppress and modeling systems to counter this sound.

''The fan is not an easy source of noise to control,'' said Gerald C. Lauchle, a professor of acoustics at Pennsylvania State University and a colleague of Dr. Sommerfeldt.
''Many interacting mechanisms create the noise.''

The specific sounds Dr. Sommerfeldt decided to counter were those made by the blades of the fan as they rotate and push air past obstructions like fan supports.
The pushing is periodic, dictated by the number and speed of the blades.

''The basic tone is distinct,'' Dr. Sommerfeldt said.
''It sounds like one you could hear if you hit a piano key.''

The experiments used two fan sizes, with blade diameters of about three inches and two-and-a-half inches.
The smaller unit allowed the researchers to fit the entire assembly of fan, speakers and mikes into the space that would normally be occupied by a standard cooling fan.

''This work is marvelous,'' Dr. Lauchle said of Dr. Sommerfeldt's results, ''because it's a new way of controlling that tonal fan noise.''
Although the noise of the fan has been toned down considerably, it still emits a faint hum.
''We've dealt with the constant pitch sounds,'' Dr. Sommerfeldt said, ''the tonal noise that sticks out above the smear of frequencies you get from random excitation'' of acoustic waves.
But the random noise remains.

''We've taken the process a good step,'' he said, ''but there are still improvements to be made.''
''Those fan tones tend to be very annoying,'' he said.
''It's good that he's reducing them significantly with this new method.''
Still, it remains to be seen whether consumers will accept the additional costs should the system be developed commercially, Dr. Clark said.
''It's not an overly expensive system,'' he said, ''but there are the prices associated with all those components.''
''It's going to be a matter of what the consumer will be willing to pay for a quiet computer,'' he said.
Household consumption also bounced back after a long slump, rising 1.2 percent.
Most economists expect the Brazilian economy to expand about 3.5 percent this year.

To the Editor:

Your recent editorials about the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (April 25, May 6 and May 25) imply that the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which relies on private bank participation, should be phased out and replaced with direct lending by the federal government.
Congress learned soon after the creation of the direct loan program the potential danger of relying on it as the sole source of federally guaranteed student loans.
Your claim that direct lending saves money is at best premature, since such savings are contingent on projected performance benchmarks and interest rate scenarios that may or may not come to pass.

The bank's governing council met in Frankfurt, while oil ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries were meeting in Beirut to authorize an increase in output of two million barrels a day.

''That is the reason why we keep our options open.''

While Mr. Trichet did not suggest that the bank was considering a rate increase in the near future, his tone has tilted perceptibly toward a more hard-line stance on combating inflation.

He said he was particularly concerned about ''second-round effects'' of rising oil prices, like a demand for higher wages.

He rejected a suggestion that expensive oil posed a dilemma for a central bank because it hobbled growth while fueling inflation -- creating a simultaneous pressure to raise and lower rates.
The bank's signal contribution to the economy, he said, is to tamp down prices.

Oil prices, and the resulting inflation, have upended the debate over monetary policy in Europe, which until recently had focused on the bank's refusal to lower rates to stimulate the faltering recovery.
The bank forecasts that the euro countries will grow 1.4 percent to 2 percent this year.

Despite his diplomatic tone, Mr. Trichet clearly feels vindicated in rebuffing Germany's chancellor, France's prime minister, and any number of journalists who had called for a rate cut.

Some analysts, like Mr. Krämer of Invesco, argue that it should have acted at this meeting.

The policies purchased on Ms. Hunt's life are an example of a newer approach, offering charities the prospect of a small benefit at little or no cost to them or their donors because investors, who hope to profit substantially, buy the insurance and pay the premiums.

But the approach unites the nonprofit and commercial worlds in a way that troubles some experts.
''Charities are selling their exclusive right to insure their donors to help investors build wealth, and it is remarkably unclear what charities actually get when it all settles out,'' said Vaughn Henry, an estate planner who holds insurance licenses in several states.
Laws in most states still prohibit such plans, although those laws are changing.
The Senate Finance Committee, expressing concern about potential abuse of tax exemptions, has been reviewing some programs and questioning the various participants.
''In entering any transaction, charities need to be very careful that their tax-exempt status is not providing inappropriate benefits to a corporation,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the committee.
''A penny of benefit to charities doesn't excuse a pound of profit to the corporations.''

Even proponents of such products concede that many of them do not pass muster.
''There are a few people who are really selling the concept well and responsibly, and there are lots of others who are selling it in a way that makes it clear they don't care whether the individuals and charities really understand it because they're only interested in making a profit,'' said Paul Ditlevson, director of legacy estate programs at Ashland University in Ohio.

Ashland has borrowed $8 million to buy a life insurance policy on an 85-year-old donor, which is expected to produce a $2.5 million profit.

Far more complex is a plan developed by Edward H. Netherland, a life insurance broker based in Nashville.
Mr. Netherland has joined UBS Warburg, a major financial services company, to market products known as Life Insurance and Life Annuities Based Certificates, or Lilacs.
Here is how Lilacs are intended to work: Investors put money into a trust that buys annuities and life insurance policies on participating donors.
The income from the annuities is used to pay premiums on the insurance and provide a return to investors.
When a donor dies, the insurance proceeds first go to repay the investors, and any extra benefits go to the charity.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the year since the first Lilacs were completed, no participating donor has died, so the concept has not been tested.
But a secondary market has already developed, allowing the original investors to sell their stakes, making it hard to track ownership and for the insured to know the beneficiaries of the policy.

The theory is that family members, unlike unrelated third parties, stand to gain more from the income, health insurance and other benefits provided by the living breadwinner than from the insurance proceeds after the person's death.

But after vigorous lobbying, the legislatures in Louisiana and New York are considering amending state laws governing who can own life insurance.

Five Lilac deals involving a total of $1 billion of insurance were completed last year, and a sixth is planned for this month.
The Ex-Students Association of the University of Texas, known as Texas Exes, is participating in one of Mr. Netherland's deals.
The association hopes to line up 1,000 alumni, ages 72 to 90, who will allow a group of insurance companies, money managers, hedge funds and other institutional investors to insure their lives at $1 million apiece.
Texas Exes says it expects to raise as much as $80 million over the life of the contracts, almost double its current endowment.
''Donors see it as an opportunity to give something back to our association and the university without it costing them or us anything out of pocket,'' said Jim Boon, the association's executive director.
The University of Texas Foundation has already enlisted three donors in two Lilac transactions.
Paul J. Youngdale Jr., general manager of the foundation, said their participation would generate roughly $1.8 million for the university.

As it happens, his accidental study provides a window onto a subject that has long stymied academics: white-collar crime.
(Yes, shorting the bagel man is white-collar crime, writ however small.)
Despite all the attention paid to companies like Enron, academics know very little about the practicalities of white-collar crime.
The reason?
There aren't enough data.
A key fact of white-collar crime is that we hear about only the very slim fraction of people who are caught.
Most embezzlers lead quiet and theoretically happy lives; employees who steal company property are rarely detected.
With street crime, meanwhile, that is not the case.
A mugging or a burglary or a murder is usually counted whether or not the criminal is caught.
A street crime has a victim, who typically reports the crime to the police, which generates data, which in turn generate thousands of academic papers by criminologists, sociologists and economists.
But white-collar crime presents no obvious victim.
And how can you measure something if you don't know to whom it happened, or with what frequency, or in what magnitude?
The victim was Paul F.

It is 3:32 a.m., and Paul F. is barreling down a dark Maryland road when he jams on the brakes and swears.
''I forgot my hearing aids,'' he mutters.
He throws the gearshift into reverse and proceeds to drive backward nearly as fast as he had been driving forward.

He is 72, and his business is still thriving.
(Thus his request to mask his full name and his customers' identities: he is wary of potential competitors poaching his clients.)
His daughter, son-in-law and one other employee now make most of the deliveries.
Today is a Friday, which is the only day Paul F. still drives.
Semiretirement has left him more time to indulge his economist self and tally his data.
He now knows, for instance, that in the past eight years he has delivered 1,375,103 bagels, of which 1,255,483 were eaten.
(He has also delivered 648,341 doughnuts, of which 608,438 were eaten.)
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

He knows a good deal about the payment rate, too.
But just as crime tends to be low on a street where a police car is parked, the 95 percent rate was artificially high: Paul F.'s presence had deterred theft.
A broad swath of psychological and economic research has argued that people will pay different amounts for the same item depending on who is providing it.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the real world, Paul F. learned to settle for less than 95 percent.
Now he considers companies ''honest'' if the payment is 90 percent or more.
''Averages between 80 percent and 90 percent are annoying but tolerable,'' he says.
''Below 80 percent, we really have to grit our teeth to continue.''
In recent years, he has seen two remarkable trends in overall payment rates.
''All my friends say: 'Aha!
Clinton!'''
Paul F. says.
''Although I must say that most of my friends are conservative and inclined to see such things where others might not.''
Entering the summer of 2001, the overall payment rate had slipped to about 87 percent.
Immediately after Sept. 11, the rate spiked a full 2 percent and hasn't slipped much since.
(If a 2 percent gain in payment doesn't sound like much, think of it this way: the nonpayment rate fell from 13 percent to 11 percent, which amounts to a 15 percent decline in theft.)
Because many of Paul F.'s customers are affiliated with national security, there may be a patriotic element to this 9/11 effect.
Or it may represent a more general surge in empathy.
He expends a great deal of energy hectoring his low-paying customers, often in the form of a typewritten note.
''The cost of bagels has gone up dramatically since the beginning of the year,'' reads one.
''Unfortunately, the number of bagels and doughnuts that disappear without being paid for has also gone up.
Don't let that continue.
I don't imagine that you would teach your children to cheat, so why do it yourselves?''
He is impatient and cantankerous but in sum agreeable.

One customer left a note saying: ''Please park in a parking space.
You are freaking a lot of people out.'')
A money slot is cut into the top.
The wooden box has worked well.
Each year he drops off about 7,000 boxes and loses, on average, just one to theft.
This is an intriguing statistic: the same people who routinely steal more than 10 percent of his bagels almost never stoop to stealing his money box -- a tribute to the nuanced social calculus of theft.
From Paul F.'s perspective, an office worker who eats a bagel without paying is committing a crime; the office worker apparently doesn't think so.
This distinction probably has less to do with the admittedly small amount of money involved than with the context of the ''crime.''
(The same office worker who fails to pay for his bagel might also help himself to a long slurp of soda while he's filling a glass in a self-serve restaurant, but it is extremely unlikely that he will leave the restaurant without paying.)

After retrieving his hearing aids, he heads for the bagel shop that provides him with roughly 50 dozen bagels, in six flavors, every day.
He drives nearly 80 m.p.h.
along empty highways and discusses what he has learned about honesty.
He is leery of disparaging individual companies or even most industries, for fear it will hurt his business.
But he will say that telecom companies have robbed him blind, and another bagel-delivery man found that law firms aren't worth the trouble.
He also says he believes that employees further up the corporate ladder cheat more than those down below.
He reached this conclusion in part after delivering for years to one company spread out over three floors -- an executive floor on top and two lower floors with sales, service and administrative employees.
Maybe, he says, the executives stole bagels out of a sense of entitlement.
(Or maybe cheating is how they got to be executives.)
His biggest surprise?
That hasn't turned out to be true.''

Since he started delivering bagels, Paul F. has kept rigorous data -- which, when run through a computer and measured against external factors ranging from the local weather to the unemployment rate, can tell some interesting stories.
Other conclusions, meanwhile, are purely intuitive, based on Paul F.'s 20-year exposure to bagel behavior.
He has identified two great overriding predictors of a company's honesty: morale and size.
Paul F. has noted a strong correlation between high payment rates and an office where people seem to like their boss and their work.
(This is one of his intuitive conclusions.)
He also gleans a higher payment rate from smaller offices.
(This one is firmly supported by the data.)
An office with a few dozen employees generally outpays by 3 percent to 5 percent an office with a few hundred employees.
This may seem counterintuitive: in a bigger office, a bigger crowd is bound to convene around the bagel table -- providing more witnesses to make sure you drop your money in the box.
(Paul F. currently charges $1 for a bagel and 50 cents for a doughnut.)
But in the big-office/small-office comparison, bagel crime seems to mirror street crime.
There is far less crime per capita in rural areas than in cities, in large part because a rural criminal is more likely to be known (and therefore caught).
Also, a rural community tends to exert greater social incentives against crime, the main one being shame.

The bagel data also show a correlation between payment rate and the local rate of unemployment.
Intuition might have argued that these two factors would be negatively correlated -- that is, when unemployment is low (and the economy is good), people would tend to be freer with their cash.
''But I found that as the unemployment rate goes down, dishonesty goes up,'' Paul F. says.
''My guess is that a low rate of unemployment means that companies are having to hire a lower class of employee.''
The data also show that the payment rate does not change when he raises bagel prices, though volume may temporarily fall.
If the payment tendencies that Paul F. has noted so far might be called macro trends, it is the micro trends -- those reflecting personal mood -- that are perhaps most compelling.
Weather, for instance, has a major effect on the payment rate.
Unseasonably pleasant weather inspires people to pay a significantly higher rate.
Unseasonably cold weather, meanwhile, makes people cheat prolifically; so does heavy rain and wind.
But worst are the holidays.
The week of Christmas produces a 2 percent drop in payment rates -- again, a 15 percent increase in theft, an effect on the same order, in reverse, as 9/11.
Thanksgiving is nearly as bad; the week of Valentine's Day is also lousy, as is the week straddling April 15.
There are, however, a few good holidays: July 4, Labor Day and Columbus Day.
The difference in the two sets of holidays?
The low-cheating holidays represent little more than an extra day off from work.
The high-cheating holidays are freighted with miscellaneous anxieties and the high expectations of loved ones.

As considerable as these oscillations may be, the fact is that a poorly paying office rarely turns into a well-paying office, or vice versa.
This has led Paul F. to believe in a sobering sort of equilibrium: honest people are honest, and cheaters will cheat regardless of the circumstance.
I never challenge people about paying, but in that place, despite notes and appeals to management, the payment rate had been abysmal, and I was fed up.
I said to the guy, 'Are you going to pay for that?'
Once the van is loaded with fresh bagels, sorted by the dozen into white paper bags that Paul F. had earlier labeled with customers' names, he begins his rounds.
It is 5:02 a.m.
The first stop is an office building in northern Virginia.
His routine is nearly always the same.
He grabs one of the magnetic ID cards dangling from his rearview mirror, hangs it from his neck, jumps around to the side of the van, loads up a cardboard box with bagels, doughnuts and a cash box and practically sprints inside.
In the snack room, he dumps the bagels from their bag, folds back the top of the doughnut tray, plunks his money box on the table and hustles out.
Then back into the van, which he drives maniacally even from one office-park cul-de-sac to the next.
(When a woman in a Lexus tarries at the entrance to one parking lot, he calls her terrible names.)
Another office building, another ID card, another delivery.
You can tell the defense contractors by the art on the walls: achingly sensual black-and-white photographs of missiles and armored personnel carriers.

By 9 a.m., he has made all his deliveries.
At 11, he will start picking up leftovers and the money boxes.
Until then, it is time for his weekly Friday morning breakfast with a dozen of his old economist friends.
They meet in the ground-floor cafeteria of the office building where one of them now works.
They swap gossip, tax tips, Ziploc bags of pipe tobacco.

These are some of the same friends who 20 years ago told Paul F. that his bagel business would never work.
People cannot be trusted, they said.
Their conversation this morning continues along those lines.
One man cites a story he heard about a toll-collector strike in England.
Another economist at the table is now a tax preparer.
He ticks off a long list of common tax evasions his clients try to use -- lying about the cost basis of stocks is perhaps the favorite -- and reminds the others that the United States tax code is, like Paul F.'s bagel business, largely built on an honor system.
Amid all the talk of cheating, lying and scamming, Paul F. takes the floor to declare his faith in humankind.
''You guys know the story about the Ring of Gyges, right?''
he says.
A man named Gyges, he explains, came upon a cave and, inside it, a skeleton wearing a ring.
Now he was faced with a choice: would he use his invisibility for good or evil?
The story comes from Plato's ''Republic.''
''Socrates was arguing against the idea that people will be dishonest if given the chance,'' Paul F. says.
''His point was that people are good, even without enforcement.''

But Paul F. doesn't tell his friends how Glaucon's story ends.
The story posed a moral question: could any man resist the temptation of evil if he knew his acts could not be witnessed?
But Paul F. sides with Socrates -- for he knows that the answer, at least 89 percent of the time, is yes.
Milk prices are derived from a complex formula determined by the selling price of cheese on Chicago's commodities market, so high demand for cheese this year, driven in part by the craze for low-carbohydrate diets, among other factors, drove up milk prices as well.

While the prices of milk and gasoline have shot up, these are far from the only products whose prices have risen precipitously.
The New York City region has steadily outstripped the nation in inflation, by more than 30 percent, in the past few months, according to data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In March, inflation in the region jumped 1.1 percent, and it rose again in April, the last month for which data is available, by 0.3 percent, bringing the biggest one-year jump in 11 years.
''We are seeing prices rise in New York at a faster level over the last couple of months than the rest of the nation,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
''What is driving it in New York is housing costs, clothing costs and food costs.''
Economists are watching inflation closely to see whether it will threaten the city's nascent economic recovery.
Most say rising prices are a sign of a healthy economy; pent-up demand and confidence that buyers can afford to pay more has led businesses to pass on increases they might have otherwise absorbed.

''In a weakening economy it has been difficult for businesses to pass along these increases,'' said Marc M. Goloven, senior regional economist for J.P. Morgan Chase and author of a monthly newsletter on the city economy.
''But in a strengthening economy, they can.''

But small business owners, particularly in upper Manhattan and in the city's other boroughs, say the price increases are narrowing profit margins and tempering the feel-good aura of recovery.
High prices for everyday items like rent, gas, transportation and, yes, milk are making them reluctant to add employees or expand even as the economy improves, some merchants say.

''I already spent six figures and four months out of commission on this place,'' said Bill Olear, who runs a recently renovated Exxon gas station down the street from Mr. Roy's bagel shop.
''High prices are cutting into my business, so there is no way I can think of hiring more mechanics or expanding.''
There are the inescapable price increases that are the stuff of everyday conversation in a city where a $20 bill seems to buy less with each passing moment: the basic unit of nourishment (a slice of pizza) and the basic unit of transportation (a subway ride) have both settled in at $2.
A crosstown taxi ride at rush hour can now bring the meter up to as much as $10.
The average apartment price in Manhattan has reached about $1 million, double what it was a decade ago.
Fears of higher interest rates drove the real estate market into a frenzy earlier this year, sending housing prices higher still.

Designer jeans, a product New Yorkers cannot seem to get enough of, are now creeping toward the $200 mark.
Order a designer cocktail at a stylish lounge in Manhattan and chances are you will be lucky to get more than $5 back from a $20 bill.

And then there are the increases that do not get so much notice, but inch up the prices of things people use every day, like milk.
Confronted with a gallon of milk priced at $4.09 last week at a Brooklyn supermarket, a retired secretary said she would use less milk in her cereal and coffee to stretch a gallon out over a week rather than just four days.

So far, rising prices have not hampered New York's steady, Wall Street-driven recovery, economists say.
''I don't think it is much of a threat to the city's economy at all,'' said Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who follows the regional economy, noting that inflation overall is still fairly low, and that New York has outstripped the nation in inflation before, sometimes for several years.
''I think the irony is, part of the reason for the increase is because of the city's economic recovery.''

That may be true in the case of $200 blue jeans, said Kevin Williams, who has run Kev's Copy Center on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem for six years, but it is not true for a photocopy.
''But no one will pay more than 5 cents a copy.
If I raised it to 8 cents, everyone would go someplace else.
So my profit margin shrinks,'' he said, pressing his thumb and forefinger together in the air.
Now a $1.55 bagel with cream cheese costs $1.60, and a 75-cent small coffee costs 80 cents.
''To me, the economy has not recovered,'' he said.
''Maybe on the books it is going up.
Maybe on Wall Street.
But not on Myrtle Avenue.
Not in my place.''
Mr. Kohn is not alone among Fed insiders.
At a time when many investors and consumers have become increasingly alarmed about a sustained rise in prices, Mr. Greenspan and many other top officials have gone out of their way to argue that inflation is likely to remain under control for the foreseeable future.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The issue is important to Mr. Greenspan, who faces a Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday for a fifth term as Fed chairman.
For if the best thinking at the Federal Reserve turns out to be wrong, the Fed could be forced to be considerably more aggressive as it embarks on an expected series of rate increases beginning this summer.
By doing so, it might run the risk of financial disruptions among institutional investors and heavily indebted consumers.
Fed officials are keenly aware that they have much to lose if their prediction is wrong.
But while they have all but announced their intention to start raising interest rates at their meeting on June 30, they are still hoping to move more slowly in the following months than they have in past cycles of tightening monetary policy.
For a full year now, the benchmark federal funds rate has been at 1 percent, the lowest since 1958.
Many analysts expect the Fed to start by raising rates no more than a quarter-point each time it meets (and it could occasionally skip a rate increase) in an effort to gradually lift this key lending rate to somewhere around 4 percent by the end of 2005.

But if some on Wall Street are right, the Fed may not have that luxury and could be forced by subsequent evidence of stronger-than-expected growth and higher prices to engineer interest rate increases of half a percentage point at one or more of the eight monetary policy meetings it ordinarily holds each year.

Adjusted for inflation, the federal funds rate is well below zero at a time when economic growth is above 4 percent a year and job creation is rising.
Other indicators of economic growth -- retail sales, new orders for capital goods and surveys showing that company executives think they have more flexibility to raise their prices -- all are running higher than expected and suggest that the Fed has achieved its goal of pulling the economy out of the doldrums.
Now the question is whether it has done its job too well.
Bond investors are worried.
Prices on inflation-protected Treasury securities have surged in the last two months, and now reflect an assumption that underlying inflation will rise to some 2.7 percent -- higher than the Fed's comfort zone of 1 percent to 2 percent -- in the next few years.
Mark Kiesel, executive vice president of Pimco, which manages about $400 billion in fixed-income securities, said that nominal economic growth, before subtracting for inflation, is nearly 7 percent a year.
By contrast, the federal funds rate is 1 percent.

''That is just a huge gap,'' said Mr. Kiesel, who predicts that inflation will climb to about 3 percent over the next year.

But even as debate has broken out on Wall Street over whether the Fed is behind the curve in reacting to inflation fears, the central bankers themselves seem unusually united in their opinions.
Federal Reserve governors, ensconced in a row of offices at headquarters here along Constitution Avenue, often clash in their views with the independent presidents of Federal Reserve district banks around the country.
In this case, though, senior officials have so far hewed closely to Mr. Greenspan's views.

''I agree with him on the fundamentals,'' William C. Poole, president of the St. Louis Fed and a longtime hawk on inflation, said in a recent interview.
Alfred Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and another longtime worrier about inflation pressures, has sided with Mr. Greenspan as well.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

''I am not dismissing the risk of an unwelcome further increase in inflation,'' Mr. Broaddus told bankers in Virginia last month.
But, he continued, most of the fundamental trends in productivity and the evidence that factories and the labor markets are still capable of tapping plenty of unused capacity and talent favored an outlook for low inflation.
''I think the risk is manageable,'' he added.
Mr. Greenspan and many other Fed governors predict that productivity will continue to climb rapidly, allowing companies to turn out more goods without adding workers and to make higher profits without substantially raising prices.

In recent comments, Fed officials have argued that rapid productivity growth will continue to dampen inflationary pressures and that the economy still has considerable ''slack'' in the form of unemployed workers -- 2.6 million jobs were lost before the recent rises began -- as well as unused factory capacity.
Another Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke, said in a recent speech, ''In my own view, economic developments over the next year are reasonably likely to be consistent with a gradual adjustment of policy.''

Even if wages do start to climb as companies hire more workers, Mr. Greenspan and other top Fed officials argue that companies will initially absorb higher costs rather than risk losing market share.
''This is the last piece of the puzzle,'' Mr. Kohn remarked.
''Things are now making sense.''
The Bank of Canada left its overnight interest rate unchanged at 2 percent, ending a series of rate cuts over the last 14 months aimed at stimulating the domestic economy.

But he said the ''basic playbook'' on budget and taxes was written by Mr. Reagan, and ''that is the playbook I follow today.''

Another lesson the current administration took from the Reagan years is that it can be politically advantageous to publish budgets with numbers that are less than fully honest.
That is also the case today, Mr. Reischauer said.
Mr. Bush has taken a different tack, but the result has been the same: an unrealistic budget.
The budget Mr. Bush submitted in February projected a deficit of $521 billion, perhaps $100 billion higher than what economists are now estimating.
As the election approaches, the administration may be able to forecast a lower deficit than was assumed in February and proclaim that the deficit is being brought under control.

But while the Reagan budget policies have survived into the Bush administration, one of the main aspects of his tax policy went by the boards long ago.

In 1985 and 1986, Mr. Reagan pushed through Congress a complete overhaul of the federal income tax system, the most sweeping changes in the tax code and one of the most important pieces of legislation since World War II.
And scores of tax preferences were abolished, ranging from the deduction for state sales taxes paid by individuals to the investment tax credit for manufacturers to tax shelters for investors in commercial real estate.
Presidents and lawmakers cannot resist using tax breaks to reward favored interest groups and to accomplish social goals without seeming to spend money.

In that vein, President Bill Clinton endorsed many new tax breaks, including a tax credit for child care, another one for employers who hire people on welfare and tax-free retirement savings accounts, and as a deficit-reduction measure, he allowed the top tax rate to rise to 40 percent.
President Bush has sought scores of new tax breaks, including those for charitable contributions, residential rental property, transfer expenses for children in failing schools, health savings accounts, individual investment accounts, development of low-cost single-family housing and land conservation.

In the area of energy policy alone, he has proposed at least seven new tax credits.
Since Mr. Reagan left office, Mr. Steuerle said, ''We have been debating whether the top rate should be 33 percent or 35 percent or 40 percent.

Banks can charge overdrawn customers steep fees for what amount to short-term loans.
But they are not required to disclose the loans' effective interest rates, which can reach into the triple digits on an annualized basis.
Through these fees, some 1,500 financial institutions prey on mostly low-income customers, and the Federal Reserve Board appears willing to condone the behavior by going along with the absurd fiction that this bounce protection is a service, not an extension of credit.
The Fed should change its tune.
The banks should at least be made to disclose the ongoing costs of this form of credit, as required by the federal truth-in-lending law.
Whether banks call it bounce protection or overdraft privilege, they are lending money.
In recent reports by the Fed and other federal banking regulators, the practice is even referred to as ''credit'' and ''loans.''
Common decency also requires that the fees be disclosed.
The ''protection'' kicks in not only when a customer writes a check without having enough funds to cover it, but also when the customer uses an A.T.M.
or a debit card to make a withdrawal or purchase for more than the funds on deposit.
Rather than being obligated to give such a customer a chance to void the transaction and avoid a high fee, a bank can inform the customer by mail that the account has been overdrawn, and that delay can have potentially dire financial consequences.
By offering this account feature mainly to customers who have automatic deposits for paychecks or government benefits, the banks can implicitly encourage overspending without any risk of not being repaid.
Truth-in-lending disclosures cover other lenders that, in effect, get away with usury, like tax-preparation firms that offer ''refund anticipation loans'' against customers' tax refunds and check-cashing outfits that offer ''payday loans'' against customers' next paychecks.
The banks offering bounce protection may not want to admit that they engage in the same kind of short-term, high-cost lending, but they are, and the Fed should regulate them accordingly.
But borrowers say it's worth the risk as demand for second homes rises.
''You make money in the appreciation -- that's how I build equity,'' said Thomas M. Crowder, 25, of Santa Rosa, Calif.

Mr. Crowder, an associate for a venture capital group, plans to use interest-only loans to buy two homes in Florida -- a one-bedroom town house in Tampa, for $83,700, and a four-bedroom house in a gated lakeside community in nearby New Tampa, for $500,000.
He plans to rent the house, which he is scheduled to close on this week, in the winter and vacation there in the summer; the town house, with a December closing date, will be rented year-round.
Both are expected to be sold within five years.
''In four or five years I could see the house go for over $800,000,'' Mr. Crowder said.
Not all borrowers, though, are looking to make a quick profit.
Some intend to make the principal payments, as many lenders allow you to do without penalty; they just like having the option of skipping a month or two.
Maybe they're not sure they can rent the place.
Or maybe their income fluctuates.
''You can achieve greater flexibility than with a fully amortizing loan,'' said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates in Pompton Plains, N.J., which tracks the mortgage industry.

But mortgage bankers are cautious.
Most of the loans carry adjustable rates, which are vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations, they say.
Also, not everyone may qualify for the loan: an average borrower has a high net income, a better-than-average credit score and is usually required to put down a higher down payment, according to David Herpers, director of consumer affairs for Amerisave Mortgage, an online bank.

Mr. Savage said, ''I always make sure that the borrowers know that if they pay interest only they must take the difference and do something constructive with that money.''
He added, ''People who make interest-only payments should be able to afford a fully amortized payment.''
What concerns others is the economy.
''What happens if rates go up and the property values stop rising?
If you're forced to hold the property, can you hold it?''
said Hank Madden, a financial planner in Jacksonville, Fla. ''In real estate you have to have a well-defined exit strategy.''

But it is when disputes over land intersect with tribe, faith or political greed that brothers and neighbors have turned on each other with sudden ferocity.
In the Darfur region of Sudan, competition over land and water underlies longstanding tensions between Arab camel herders and black African subsistence farmers.
Those tensions, among other things, have fed into a terrifying civil war there, with Arab militias backed by the Sudanese government chasing black Africans off their land in what United Nations officials have deplored as a campaign of ''ethnic cleansing.''

Here in the central highlands of Nigeria, farmers and herders are divided along ethnic as well as religious lines.
The farmers call themselves natives of the land, and they are overwhelmingly Christian.
The herders are ethnic Fulani who range across the region in search of pasture for their herds, and they are overwhelmingly Muslim.

The ethnic groups that consider themselves indigenous to the area squared off with those they called ''settlers'': ethnic Fulani and Hausa who have lived in the region for roughly 100 years.
The Hausa-Fulani have prospered economically but complain about political disenfranchisement.

Such a number -- or an even higher one -- would probably be seen as a reaffirmation of the strength of the housing sector, despite rising mortgage rates.

For Fed watchers, however, the implications of a high number would be fuzzier.
It would probably give comfort to those who are convinced that the Fed will act aggressively at its next meeting -- by raising short-term rates by half a percentage point -- to choke off inflation before it chokes the economy.
Those who think that the threat of inflation is only modest, and that the Fed will act with restraint, are expecting an initial rate increase of only a quarter of a point.
Further rate increases are expected, but there is wide disagreement over how many there will be and how quickly they will come.

A lower-than-expected number for new-home sales might suggest a weakening in the housing sector, a bulwark of the economy for the last few years.
If such suspicions are raised, extra attention will be focused on a report on Friday by the National Association of Realtors on sales of existing homes, a much larger category.
The Wall Street consensus calls for sales of 6.5 million existing homes in May, according to Bloomberg.
That would mean a decline of about 2 percent from the previous month.
Home buyers usually lock in interest rates for at least 60 days, so most economists believe that the May numbers won't show much effect from rising rates.
So a steep decline in this number for May might worry the markets -- and bolster arguments for restraint by the Fed.
HOW CONFIDENT ARE CONSUMERS?
-- A fairly complete and current picture of consumer attitudes toward the economy may be revealed on Friday, when the University of Michigan issues the final figure for its consumer confidence survey for June.
Bloomberg says Wall Street expects a high reading, 95, close to the preliminary figure of 95.2 last week, and much stronger than the 90.2 from May.
For Fed watchers, that might tilt the scale toward a bigger rate increase.

In the long recitations of recent business scandals, Symbol is not among the name brands of corporate America laid low by executive skullduggery, like Enron and WorldCom.
Yet two things about Symbol stand out.
The second is the extent of the management and strategic overhaul of Symbol, under Mr. Nuti and a new team of executives.
''They've been faced with the challenge of cleaning up Dodge and setting a new direction for the company at the same time,'' observed Geoffrey A. Moore, chairman of the Chasm Group, a technology consultant, which has done work for Symbol.

Symbol, according to industry analysts and company employees, is a very different place under Mr. Nuti.
In the last year and a half, he has led a sweeping transformation, installing new practices and new people.
More than 130 managers and executives have been replaced, and dozens were fired, including the manager who hid the expenses in 2002.
Today, 15 of the 16 members of Symbol's senior management team are new to the company.

The new leadership group is young, mostly in their late 30's and early 40's, and all were recruited by Mr. Nuti, who is 40.
The chief federal prosecutor in the case, Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, called the criminal scheme ''breathtaking in its scope'' and ''a veritable playbook of corporate fraud.''

The intent, according to the S.E.C., was to artificially lift revenues and reduce expenses, thus falsely increasing reported earnings.

''What's unusual about Symbol is the great concentration of fraudulent practices in a single case,'' said George N. Stepaniuk, assistant regional director of the S.E.C.
But he had been hindering the inquiry for months, according to S.E.C.
investigators, hiding some documents and removing incriminating entries from others.

To test Symbol's business practices, Mr. Nuti walked a few transactions through the company, from giving a customer a price quote to collecting cash in payment.

The settlements were a milestone for Symbol.
At the end of last year, the company issued its restatement of sales and profits for the period covered by the fraud, reducing revenues over the five-year span by $234 million and net income by $325 million.
Despite Symbol's travails, Mr. Nuti remains optimistic.
Symbol is an industry leader in hand-held bar-code scanners used in retail stores and warehouses and the wireless networks that link the field devices to corporate data centers.
Its technology has been a crucial cog in product tracking and just-in-time procurement used by some big Symbol customers, like Wal-Mart.

Based on its traditional business, the company had sales last year of $1.5 billion and reported a slight profit of $3.3 million, after four years of losses totaling $260 million, after the restatement.
But the real case for optimism at Symbol rests on its ability -- still unproven -- to move further into related new technologies and new markets, like health care and homeland security.
Hand-held scanners are going digital and adding new features, from advanced communications functions like voice recognition to built-in digital cameras.
Increasingly, the simple bar codes on goods will be enhanced by radio frequency identification technology, known as RFID, putting more product and shipment data on each package.
Symbol, Mr. Nuti says, has a large opportunity to supply the hardware devices and the software for continuously linking mobile people and products with corporate databases.
''We want to be a leader in this new age of corporate mobility,'' he explained.
''We think we have a good shot at it.''

Today, they are encouraged to get out and become part of the company's ''virtual sales teams.''
Several months ago, Symbol set up an internal Web site for collecting customer information that is then analyzed and fed to engineering teams for product development.
Today, five-year sales and marketing projections are part of product plans.
One result: The number of product configurations Symbol offers has been reduced by more than half.
While Symbol, by every measure, seems to be a company on the mend, its reputation, brand and market share have all suffered as a result of the fraud and the corporate culture that allowed it to flourish for years.

Some measure of responsibility for Symbol's corporate culture surely rests with Dr. Jerome Swartz, co-founder and former chairman of Symbol.
Dr. Swartz has not been charged with any misconduct, but he agreed to pay $14 million to settle with the company and class-action plaintiffs.
An electrical engineer and inventor, Dr. Swartz is credited with developing much of the company's basic technology and leading its research programs.
But his experience can be seen as a cautionary tale of the danger of an archetypal engineer disdaining business management as mere bean counting -- at least, if that engineer happens to be the chairman of a large public company.
Mr. Razmilovic, who was indicted earlier this month, is now a fugitive living in Sweden and, according to a recent report in the Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri, has said that he does not intend to return to the United States to face charges.
Diesel fuel stealing has quadrupled in the last several months here in Fresno County and in some other parts of the Central Valley, the nation's richest farming region and a land of plenty for thieves cashing in on spiraling prices.
The price of diesel in California has risen 25 percent in the last year, according to the Department of Energy, turning it into the hottest black-market agricultural commodity around.
Diesel here is now consistently over $2 a gallon, most recently 34 cents above the national average.

''The theft is really market driven and price driven,'' said William E. Yoshimoto, a supervising lawyer in the district attorney's office in Tulare County, southeast of here, who oversees a valleywide program to fight agricultural crime.
''You hope it is not someone stockpiling diesel fuel to make a bomb.''
While there have been big diesel thefts in other states -- five people were arrested in April in Palm Beach County, Fla., for selling stolen farm diesel to truckers -- agricultural and law enforcement officials say California is in a category by itself.
Diesel prices here are the highest; farmland extends across thousands of square miles, making it difficult to patrol; and there are untold buyers on the lookout for cheap fuel.
''It seems things start on the West Coast, so unfortunately we're the trendsetter,'' said Debbie Jacobsen, a grape farmer who is president of the farm bureau in Fresno County, where agriculture is a $4-billion-a-year business.

In the first five and a half months of this year, the authorities estimate, thieves in the eight counties that make up the Central Valley have stolen 46,000 gallons of diesel fuel, 30 percent more than in all of last year.
The amount stolen is small when measured against total diesel consumption in the valley; Mr. Nilmeier, whose family farms about 500 acres and also runs a small trucking company, stores 50,000 gallons on his property alone.

But the loss of diesel is only the start of it.
''The cost to farmers is exponential beyond the cost of the fuel,'' said Sheriff's Lt. Jeffrey L. Johnson, commander of the Fresno County Agricultural Task Force.
''When a farmer has to shut down operations for 6 or 8 or 10 hours waiting for a shipment of fuel, he is losing money, slowing the harvest and delaying filling contracts.''

The authorities say small-time criminals with nothing more than a pickup truck and a 55-gallon drum are draining farm equipment with garden hoses by the light of the moon, while big-time operators are hauling off 5,000 gallons at a time -- sometimes with a tank and trailer in tow.
In February, the police in Tulare County arrested a man in Porterville who has been charged with driving a stolen flatbed truck loaded with plastic drums of diesel fuel, about 950 gallons in all.
''He was driving down the road sloshing diesel everywhere,'' said Sgt.
Mike Renteria of the Tulare County Sheriff's Department.

Perplexed as to how to avoid a repeat, Mr. Ricchiuti has resorted to removing the wheels and tires from his remaining trailers.

''The sheriffs tell me they found the same identical tire tracks of my stolen trailer at some of these other locations where fuel is being taken,'' he said.
''They're using my trailer to steal other fuel.''

The diesel fuel situation has become so serious that at the Tulare County district attorney's office, Mr. Yoshimoto's group, the Agricultural Crime Technology Information and Operations Network, or Action, has made it a focus of dealings with the region's rural law enforcement agencies.
The network, which is federally financed, has also placed surveillance equipment like motion sensors and cameras in remote areas considered particularly vulnerable.
There have been a handful of arrests, but what frustrates many farmers is that so few thieves are being caught and that in all likelihood, the stealing is being tacitly encouraged by the fact that some farmers seem willing to buy the stolen fuel.
A local state legislator has proposed stiffening the penalties for people convicted of stealing diesel, but Mr. Ricchiuti, the Clovis farmer, said that misses the point.

''It is kind of like prostitution, where you target the people who are the users and you then eliminate the supply,'' he said.
''We have to go after the people who are buying the stuff.''
But the authorities acknowledge that as little as they know about the thieves, they know even less about the buyers.
Much of the stolen fuel is so-called red diesel, meaning it has been dyed to indicate it is for agricultural purposes and is therefore taxed less than diesel for transport.
Because of the stiff penalties truckers face if caught with it, law enforcement officials speculate that most of the stolen red diesel is probably going to other farms.

Many farmers, however, also use clear diesel.
Thieves also frequent the back parking lots at truck stops, striking deals with drivers.

he said, adding that he believes rising home prices will help him obtain a better loan deal by then.
With interest rates going up, that may be wishful thinking.
Most analysts agree that there is no nationwide housing bubble because housing prices have climbed only slowly in the Midwest and the South, even as they have soared on the East and West Coasts.
Still, if rising interest rates cause housing prices to drop, even slightly, industry officials warn that some new buyers will have no equity in their homes and could choose to walk away from their loans if they run into trouble with payments.
''A lot of these loans are dangerous,'' said Allen Jackson, manager of Bristol Home Loan in Bellflower, Calif., a mortgage broker who specializes in so-called subprime loans, which charge higher interest rates to people unable to qualify for traditional mortgages.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at the research firm Economy.com, estimates that about a third of the nation's housing is now overpriced and poised for at least a mild drop in values as the Fed begins to push up rates.

And there is a risk that the situation could turn into something a lot worse.

''This is a big, rapidly growing market that has not been tested by higher interest rates.
Southern California is at the leading edge.

The big question is whether prices will remain so high once the Fed begins raising interest rates.
Today, interest rates are clearly heading up, but employment is climbing and economic growth appears strong.

Consider capacity utilization, a measure of how much of the nation's industrial infrastructure is being used.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the past, low industrial capacity rates meant that a large number of factories were off line, often temporarily.
But in May, Anthony M. Santomero, a Fed governor, suggested in a speech that ''with the recent pace of technological change, a disproportionate share of that stock may be obsolete.''
And if that is the case, he said, ''the true degree of slack in industrial capacity, and hence the downward pressure on inflation, may be overstated.''
He has a point.
The problems affecting manufacturing in recent years have not been cyclical, as they may have been in the past; they are structural.
The manufacturing capacity of Pennsylvania, Ohio and much of the world is moving to places like Shenzhen.
Many textile and steel factories that are idle today may be permanently mothballed, or simply broken down and placed on fast boats to China.

What's more, an alternate measure of capacity utilization shows significantly less slack.

Questions have also been raised about the Consumer Price Index.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Paradoxically, the Fed's prolonged restraint of interest rates to forestall deflation may have helped tamp down the inflation measure in the price index.
Low interest rates make buying a home more attractive, and renting a home or apartment less attractive.
So in the past few years, home prices have risen while apartment rents have fallen.
But the price index gauges housing costs by using a rental-equivalent approach, which measures, as the working paper put it, ''the value of the shelter services an owner receives from his or her home.''
As a result, ''price movements in owner's equivalent rent reflect changes in prices of rental units that are comparable in characteristics to owner-occupied homes.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In other words, the index more closely tracks rent than housing prices.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

SOME economists view this as a sign that the price index isn't capturing the true state of the economy.
''Housing prices are increasing at anywhere between 6 and 12 percent annually, and that's not showing up in the C.P.I.,'' said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stevens & Thompson, a research firm in Chicago.
Low interest rates have also helped stimulate record sales of new cars.
But when new cars are plentiful and comparatively cheap, prices for used cars fall.
The Atlanta economists conclude that falling prices for sedans and S.U.V.
's accounted for 0.3 percent of that 1.6 percent decline in core inflation.

Mr. Santomero and the Atlanta researchers did not suggest that Mr. Greenspan missed the boat on inflation by relying on figures and measures that might be outdated or misleading.

Preparing for Higher Rates

The Federal Reserve is creating a new economic dynamic as it prepares to raise its benchmark rate by a quarter-point to 1.25 percent, up from a 46-year low.
And economists note that rising rates often expose problems that were papered over by the benefits of ever-cheaper credit.

Mortgage-backed securities are another area of concern in a rising interest rate environment.
Banks that have spent the last few years focusing on that segment of the market may be hammered by outsize financial setbacks as rates rise.

Washington Mutual's announcement, which was made shortly after the stock market closed, is certain to have a sobering effect on investors concerned about the broader impact of rate increases.
And traders appeared to be assuming the worst yesterday.

While all consumer banks' profits are at risk when rates rise, Washington Mutual is also struggling with some unique problems.
It went on a major acquisition spree over the last few years, and banking analysts say it has done a poor job of cutting back expenses at the companies it has acquired.

Wall Street observers have mentioned Washington Mutual itself as a possible takeover target, but any acquirer is certain to be hesitant about the bank's troubling exposure to rate increases and its unwieldy risk management practices.

''And I lowered my recommendation because there's very poor earnings visibility.
The company is just not being managed well right now, which is something of a surprise.''
Last year, about $4 trillion worth of new mortgages was underwritten nationally, according to Mr. Gray, but he said that figure would drop to about $2 trillion this year and $1 trillion next year -- a steep and rapid slide that will sideswipe any bank that has not prepared for a downturn.
Washington Mutual has only recently reined in its headlong rush to embrace the mortgage lending boom.
For example, Mr. Gray said, the bank is still opening new retail bank branches at a breathtaking clip -- about 20 new branches a month.

To be sure, some banking executives have shown a sense of discipline as the retail banking cycle has crested.
Citigroup was rumored to be one of the banks seeking to acquire Washington Mutual, but Charles O.
But some analysts say they are worried that other banking executives may not have followed the example of Mr.
Prince and Mr. Daberko.
''Every cycle, these mortgage companies make mistakes and they tell you that they're not going to repeat the mistake,'' said Richard Bove, a banking analyst with Hoefer & Arnett.
''Then, when the next cycle comes, they repeat the mistake.
They never stop expanding until the cycle blows up.''
IT happens to everyone -- that moment when wine loses it charm, when every chardonnay tastes like every other chardonnay, when last year's merlot is out of fashion, when the treasures you yearn for are too expensive and the wines you can afford are all boring.
It happens, but it shouldn't.
There is too much good wine out there.
I once hazarded a guess that New Yorkers probably have 10,000 wines to choose from.
Someone up on such things corrected me: the figure is closer to 22,000.
That's a different wine every day for 60 years.
So there is no reason to get into a wine rut.
Someone is always coming up with something new and different.
Or old and different.
Unexpected gems turn up in tastings, in restaurants and bars or on friends' recommendations.
Sometimes it's just a question of rummaging through the bins in a wine shop, the way one pokes around a bookstore.
What follows is a sampling of interesting yet inexpensive bottles worth noting.
For starters there is a dry chenin blanc from, aptly, Dry Creek Vineyard in Sonoma.
Chenin blanc has had a long and troubled history in California's vineyards.
A lot of people are now fed up with chardonnay and willing to try alternatives.
Fermented dry, chenin blanc becomes a full-flavored but lean-bodied wine, perfectly suited to shellfish and dishes with cream sauces.
For my money, chenin is better than the popular viognier, which works best when it is softening up Côte-Rôtie.
The $12 Dry Creek chenin blanc comes from Clarksburg in the Sacramento Delta, where the grape seems to thrive.

For anyone intrigued by the flowery qualities of viognier, whose origins are in the northern Rhône, I strongly suggest sampling the roussanne from Tablas Creek, a winery in Paso Robles, Calif., in which the Perrin brothers from Châteauneuf-du-Pape in France are partners.
Roussanne at its best is a supremely elegant wine, seemingly made from the essences of a hundred flowers and fruits.
Asked to sum up its charms in two words, I would immediately say ''rose petals.''
Price: about $30.

If roussanne is Debussy, zinfandel is Brahms.
It is big and muscular and calls to mind mountains and forests more than drawing rooms and flowers.
Ridge Vineyards long ago mastered the knack of making fine zinfandels but continues to reinvent itself with new versions of the wine made from grapes from all over California.
Most Ridge zinfandels are reasonably priced, at about $30 or less.
I hate to think what the price was then, but it's still only about $10 a bottle, and it's the perfect red summer wine.
Federal Reserve Increases Benchmark Interest Rate

The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years, officially signaling that a remarkable period of historically low rates is drawing to a close.
But even as the central bank increased the cost of borrowing for financial institutions on overnight loans to 1.25 percent from 1 percent, it sought to soothe investors by saying that inflationary pressures remain low and that further interest rate increases should come at a ''measured'' pace.

Signs of a softer market for cars run counter to recent reports -- on consumer confidence and personal consumption -- that point to increased spending by consumers.
The auto industry, which has been promoting sales since 2001 with big cash and financing incentives, may have trouble keeping growth strong in the months ahead.

''We have been jamming the system aggressively since 2001 with aggressive promotions and incentives,'' said Joe Phillippi, a principal with AutoTrends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J. ''We've been pushing 16 to 17 million units a year for more than six years, and there is an issue of saturation that we are going to have to contend with.''
But higher consumer interest rates, in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to raise its benchmark rate a quarter of a percentage point, are not expected to have an impact on sales, at least in the short term.
Automakers, especially the domestic automakers, are likely to choose to absorb the higher cost of borrowing money -- at the expense of profitability -- rather than ratchet down incentives.
That is especially true for Ford and General Motors, which are both sitting on higher-than-normal inventories going into the summer selling season.
General Motors had more than 1.35 million vehicles sitting on dealer lots at the end of June.
''That's 150,000 units too high,'' Mr. Ballew of G.M.
''We definitely need to pick up the pace through the second half of 2004 and through 2005.''

With supply that high, the only way to move cars is to offer incentives for the rest of the year, said Jesse Toprak, director of pricing and analysis at Edmunds.com.

It is possible, however, that stock investors will focus next week on the angle that bond investors took -- that the Fed can move at a measured pace in raising rates and still curb inflation.
If that is the case, stocks could rally.
As for the dollar, its gains against the euro since May have been supported by the expectation that interest rates here would be moving higher.
Data indicating that the pace of rate increases could be slower undermine the dollar's value.

Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, said bonds were also rallying because the Federal Reserve had been very good to the bond market this week.
But Mr. McCarthy said that interest rates should move higher again because the economy is still strong, inflation has not yet faded and the Fed will still be raising its benchmark rate -- which is now 1.25 percent -- in the months ahead.
''We are looking at a temporary interruption in a rising-rate environment,'' he said.
The easing of concern about big rate increases by the Fed in the months ahead is reflected in the drop in the yield on the Treasury's two-year note and in the performance of the futures contracts on the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate on loans between banks and serves as the Fed's benchmark rate.

Louis Crandall, the chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, said this change in the fed funds futures contracts reflects both a revised expectation about the actual Fed action and a diminished risk in that bet.
He said slower job growth and the Fed's wording this week have helped policy makers believe that future rate increases can come at a measured pace.
''Now that we know that they kept the measured-pace language and that payrolls are lower, there is less that can go wrong between now and the August meeting,'' Mr. Crandall said.

Migrants have dominated the national spotlight in Mexico since the election four years ago of President Vicente Fox.
Mr. Fox, a native of Guanajuato, another high-migration state in northern Mexico, hails migrants as national heroes for sending home an estimated $14 billion a year.
Mr. Fox unsuccessfully pressed the United States to give legal status to an estimated three million undocumented Mexicans who work there.
Last month, he sent a proposal to the Mexican Congress that would give Mexicans in the United States the power to vote in this country's presidential elections without returning home.
The proposal does not provide details about the logistics and financing for such an enormous undertaking -- experts estimate that two million to six million Mexicans would cast ballots across the United States.
It also remains unclear whether a divided Mexican Congress will support the proposal.

''The bottom line is that not a single political party wants to include us because they do not know how we would vote,'' said Guadalupe Gómez, the former president of the influential Federation of Zacatecanos of Southern California who came here two weeks ago to support Mr. Bermúdez.
''Since most of us were forced to leave Mexico because our government was not capable of supporting our families, the least they could do is give us our rights.''
Four migrants are expected to test those reforms in state elections on Sunday.
Among them is the political operative Manuel de la Cruz, who swam across the Rio Grande around the same time Mr. Bermúdez was riding in the trunk of a car into California.

None of the candidates, it seemed, have sparked as many imaginations as the tomato king.
His campaign -- marked by promises to ''make Jerez more like America'' -- has brought back migrants of all ages who said they are fed up with decades of poverty, political corruption and impunity.
Others saw the campaign as an opportunity to give back a little of all they have received.
''We have learned a lot in the United States,'' said Juan de la Torre, who builds docks along the coast of Southern California.
''Now we want to use what we have learned to make real changes in Mexico.
And we need politicians, like Andrés, who will listen to us, not shut the door.''

The national safety law, scheduled to be announced Wednesday, allows the prime minister to declare emergency rule in any part of Iraq threatened by instability, Dr. Allawi said in an interview in his cavernous office near the new American Embassy.

''Whenever and wherever it's going to be necessary, we will apply this law,'' Dr. Allawi said, speaking in a slow, gruff voice on his ninth day in office.
[Excerpts, Page A8.]
Skeptics say the Iraqi security forces do not have the numbers, weapons or training to enforce emergency law and will need to lean heavily on American forces.
Dr. Allawi said that the government was ''beefing up these resources'' and that ''Iraqis should shoulder the responsibility, should be the people who enforce law and order in Iraq and against the terrorists.''
A draft of the law obtained by The New York Times independently of Dr. Allawi's office stated that the prime minister has the right to ''impose restrictions on the freedoms of citizens or foreigners in Iraq'' in the event of a ''dangerous threat'' or ''the occurrence of armed instability that threatens state institutions or its infrastructure.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The restrictions include the curtailing or banning of travel, group meetings and the possession of weapons.

The prime minister also has the power to take direct control of all security and intelligence forces in the area under emergency rule.
According to the draft, he can also ''appoint a military or civilian commander to assume administration of an emergency area'' with the help of an emergency force, as long as the president -- currently Sheik Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar -- approves.

The law also imposes some restrictions on the emergency powers, including court reviews.
The prime minister can impose emergency law only for a specified duration and must get the approval of the president, according to the document.

When Dr. Allawi first said last month that he might declare a state of emergency, critics worried that elections could be canceled.
Human rights advocates are now raising concerns that the powers might be arbitrarily imposed, saying they want guarantees of fair treatment and proper legal procedures for anyone seized under martial law.
In addition, she said, ''one of the dangers in such a situation is that people would be arrested without a warrant; if they're not arrested with a warrant, then there's no paper trail.''
''We need assurances there will be no exceptional areas in regard to the fundamental rights of the accused,'' she added.

Under the formal American occupation, Iraqis in effect lived under martial law for 15 months.
Soldiers imposed curfews, cordoned off neighborhoods or villages and detained people at will.
United Nations Resolution 1546 still grants the American military many of those rights.
Since the American occupation authority formally turned over sovereignty to Iraq on June 28, Dr. Allawi, a former Baath Party official who worked from abroad against Saddam Hussein, has tried to strike a balance in dealing with the insurgency.

They also have spread the word to others across the country, and we are finding more and more positiveness on this attitude.''

There are signs that some Iraqis might have become fed up with insurgent bombings in which ordinary people have been killed.
One insurgent group released a video on Tuesday threatening to drive out the Jordanian fighter Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who has taken responsibility for many kidnappings and bombings.
As for the new emergency law, a senior American military official said American soldiers could help enforce it in certain situations.

''We can certainly be supportive of the Iraqi government when asked, on a case-by-case basis, looking at our means and capabilities,'' the official said.
''If they wanted us to put up additional checkpoints to support the public safety law, we could be helpful.
If they wanted us to support their curfews as we have done up in Mosul, I'm sure we can be helpful in that regard.''
He said the highest courts in Iraq and a group of judges on call 24 hours a day would be available to approve search warrants and other actions.

The draft of the law states that a national assembly expected to be formed later this month could oversee how the law is enforced.
The prime minister's decisions under emergency rule are subject to the review of the court of appeals, which can cancel the decisions, the draft said.
The document also forbids the prime minister to cancel the transitional administrative law during a state of emergency.
That clause appears to be a nod to the Kurds, who value the transitional law because it essentially gives them veto power over the permanent constitution.
The emergency law also prevents the prime minister from exercising martial powers in the region of Kurdistan without consulting officials there.

In the past week, the new government has gathered Iraqi and foreign reporters twice to announce details of the emergency law, only to cancel at the last minute.

''In fact,'' he said, ''we completed signing the law after really elaborate deliberations and discussions to ensure checks and balances and to ensure the adherence to the rule of law and to the human rights, the respect of human rights issues.''
According to the draft, the law allows for the detention of ''those suspicious by their behavior and to search them or search their homes and places of employment and to impose mandatory residence upon them.''
''But once it becomes necessary,'' he said, ''we'll do it.''
This is the point at which the book's research component kicks in.
It is the time, for instance, to learn that Woodlawn is where the inventor of FM radio is buried.
But ''The Secret City'' is a book that favors odd contortions.
After some straightforward background about Woodlawn and its history, Mr. Goodman abruptly summons the specter of Melville and joins him to witness the events of September 11, 2001.
(''I finally watch with him as first one and then the other building crumbles.'')

''Listen: I have an act of faith to perform,'' Mr. Goodman announces to a New York in mourning.
''I want to tell you my story about our cemeteries, the big one up in the Bronx and the other one that we're walking around in.
It goes like this.''
So here comes Walt Whitman, frayed trouser cuffs and all, ''nodding vigorously'' and exclaiming ''Yes!''
in Mr. Goodman's eagerly reanimated version.
Now ''The Secret City'' becomes a string of desperate dramatizations, scenes that wake Woodlawn's residents from their eternal slumber and plunge them into dialogue of dubious provenance.
When Whitman meets the phrenologists and publishers Orson and Lorenzo Fowler, who will go on to publish ''Leaves of Grass,'' Mr. Goodman even dreams up some ersatz excitable Whitman.
Upon making a business deal with the publishers, this book's Whitman declares, ''Professor, you make a man's organ of Acquisitiveness positively throb with delight!''

Otherwise, delight over Mr. Goodman's embroideries is liable to be in short supply.
After learning that Whitman is ''not partial to strawberries,'' the reader is next confronted with sacks of rats.
The book imagines the rats in combat, ''swarming around the dog in a terrified riot of hair and teeth,'' as Mr. Goodman makes his bumpy segue to the story of Woodlawn's Henry Bergh, crusader against cruelty to animals and founder of the S.P.C.A.
As is often the case here, Mr. Goodman points out that there is a good, straightforward biography of his subject (in this case a book called ''Angel in Top Hat,'' by Zulma Steele) that is difficult if not impossible to find.
Lurid description of the swill being fed to cows gives way to the presidential privilege of Chester A. Arthur: now the book has moved on to Austin Corbin, its closest approximation of Ozymandias' broken statue in the desert.
In his heyday, while trying to sway President Arthur to advance his own developing schemes, Corbin was a man winning big at a real-life game of Monopoly.

A maverick Congressman (Vito Marcantonio), an aviator (Ruth Nichols) and the sculptor (Attilio Piccirilli) whose 300,000 pound Lincoln Memorial had to be created in sections (''Signore President Lincoln might have held the Union together, but we had to break him apart'') provide further opportunities for Mr. Goodman to ramble.
What's the connection?
Even he admits how arbitrary it becomes.
''Like a satisfied tourist whose fond memories of a recent package tour to Rome now cause him to stop and read all the newspaper stories with Italian datelines he once ignored,'' he writes, ''my antennae have become tuned to any vibrations emanating from that well-fertilized patch of Bronx earth.''
But at the end of the day -- the part of life that ''The Secret City'' obsessively addresses -- this place is dead.

Correction: July 21, 2004, Wednesday The Books of The Times review on July 8, about ''The Secret City: Woodlawn Cemetery and the Buried History of New York,'' by Fred Goodman, includes an erroneous reference from the book to the burial place of Henry Bergh, founder of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
His grave is in Green-Wood Cemetery, in Brooklyn -- not at Woodlawn, in the Bronx.
But the committee chairman, John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, and several other members, concentrated on a different point, that National Airport remains closed to most traffic besides scheduled airliners, at the insistence of security officials, even though the sequence of events involving the Kentucky State Police plane indicated that the ban on most private planes might not, in fact, preclude an attack on Washington using such a plane.
Former President George Bush has landed at National 14 times since 9/11, Bill Clinton 3 times and Gerald Ford once.
''If the private sector's going to suffer, then so should everyone else,'' Mr. Mica said.

The Kentucky State Police plane, 1972 King Air, was approaching Reagan National Airport with a broken transponder, electronic equipment that listens for queries from the civilian radar system on the ground and responds with the plane's identity and altitude.
From the timing of the response, the radar system can deduce the plane's longitude and latitude.

According to a chronology from the aviation subcommittee of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the plane entered a zone with a 15-mile-radius around the capital in which flight is severely restricted at 4:30 p.m. on June 9.
A minute later, the Capitol police, monitoring the hot line, ordered the evacuation.

G.M.
and Ford are also sitting on very high inventories going into the summer.
G.M.
had more than 1.3 million cars and trucks on dealer lots at the end of June, giving it an 89-day supply -- more than 30 days above the industry average.
Ford's inventory is 949,000 vehicles, or a 84-day supply, according to Edmunds.com, which tracks such data.
That level is higher than the company would like, George Pipas, chief sales analyst for Ford, said during a conference call July 1 to discuss the company's sales figures.
Chrysler, on the other hand, has an inventory of 605,000 vehicles, which translates into a 72-day supply.
Disappointing June sales touched off the new round of incentives from G.M.
and Ford.

In the first six months of the year, G.M.
's market share in the United States has slipped to 26.8 percent, from 27.2 percent, in the period a year earlier, according to the Autodata Corporation, and Ford's market share has dropped almost a full percentage point to 18.8 percent this year, from 19.9 percent, a year earlier.

Chrysler, however, has been able to push its market share up in a very competitive market, to 13.5 percent, in the first six months, from 13.4 percent.
That is in sharp contrast to last summer, when Chrysler was in danger of losing its No.3 position in the United States auto market.

While Chrysler's incentives did increase in the first six months of this year, the company began slowly decreasing them last month, compared with its domestic competitors.
According to data compiled by Autodata, Chrysler's incentives in June this year were down 1.2 percent, from June 2003, to an average of $3,659 for each vehicle.
Both G.M.
up 4 percent, to $4,091, the highest in the industry.
But with the onslaught of the new bigger incentives from G.M.
and Ford, it may be far tougher to gain market share for all brands, especially in competitive areas like trucks and sport utility vehicles.

''This is going to put added pressure on Nissan and Toyota, whose newer full-size S.U.V.

Indeed, Asian automakers had been somewhat insulated from the pricing battles among G.M., Ford and Chrysler because many shoppers do not move between domestic and foreign brands.

But over the last six months, Toyota, Honda and Nissan have all increased their incentives, according to Autodata, in an effort to remain competitive and to hold on to the market share they have captured over the last several years.

Asian brands, including the Korean makers Hyundai and Kia, captured 34.4 percent of the market in the first six months of this year, while American automakers' share slipped to a historic low of 59 percent.
Honda has made some of the biggest leaps in incentives in the first six months of the year, according to Autodata.
It has more than doubled them, to an average of $1,011 a vehicle, from $479, in the period a year earlier.

''Spending is up across the board.
It has gotten into the consumers' mind-set that they are going to get a great deal on a car,'' said Andy Boyd, a Honda spokesman.
''But we're still trying to fight the good fight.
We don't give direct customer cash back; instead our spending is more on leasing and interest rates.''
Even the resurgent Chrysler, which introduced its 2005 models earlier than its competitors, cannot step away completely from the incentives battle, given how competitive the market has become this summer and how fickle consumers can be.

''I do think being the first one out with 2005 models put them at a short-term advantage,'' said David Lucas, a vice president at Autodata.
''I don't know if the advantage will be there in September, October and November.''
''These days, the initial excitement for vehicles has a very short duration,'' he added.
Mr. Dilts said Chrysler would continue to offer a $1,000 cash-back offer on many of its vehicles, including the popular 300C, for people who decide to finance their cars through the company's financial unit, Chrysler Financial.
''We've also sweetened the deal on the Pacifica,'' he said, referring to the new large station wagon that showed sputtering sales in June.

No matter what the company decides to do with incentives as the summer stretches on, Mr. Dilts said he would keep them as simple as possible for the customer to understand.

After months of terror and anarchy here, many Iraqis are only too happy to believe that their new prime minister is a tough guy who is on their side.

Mr. Allawi's hard-nosed reputation, even the unearned parts, is indicative of the unusual ways in which the country's interim government, which took over on June 28, appears to be acquiring a measure of legitimacy among the Iraqi people.
Unelected, headed by an exile and chosen largely by diplomats from the United States and the United Nations, the new Iraqi government nonetheless appears to be enjoying something of a honeymoon, even as Mr. Allawi has quickly embarked on a series of sweeping and potentially draconian measures aimed at quelling the guerrilla insurgency.
Yet Mr. Allawi also faces a conundrum in the coming months: as he tries to assert Iraqi control and bring a degree of order to this country, thereby gaining the gratitude of many Iraqis, he will risk alienating the very group, the country's Sunni Arab minority, from which an overwhelming majority of the violence here has been generated.

Among Iraq's three major groups, it is the Sunni Arabs who are still most broadly resisting the American-sponsored framework that is designed to lead the country toward democratic rule next year.
Iraq's Shiites, the country's largest group, are hungry for elections that promise them their first real shot at political power.
The Kurds, America's closest friends, seem to be planning to hunker down and watch events from their stronghold in the north.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Without the support of the Sunni Arabs, a minority that has dominated the country for five centuries, it seems unlikely that Mr. Allawi will make much headway in bringing a measure of stability in time to hand over power to a democratically elected government next year.

Indeed, without some success in winning over the towns and villages of the Sunni Triangle, the area north and west of Baghdad where the insurgency is still churning, it is conceivable that the nationwide elections scheduled to be held by January might have to be postponed or even forgone in significant parts of the country.
In some ways, Mr. Allawi seems to be the perfect man, under the circumstances, to bring this fractious country together.
As a Shiite, he is a member of the country's largest group, and although he is thought to be a largely secular man, his ascension to the post of prime minister was not opposed by Iraq's most powerful religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.
Mr. Allawi is known for his decade of work in trying to topple Mr. Hussein, but he is a former Baathist himself, with suggestions among those who regard him with suspicion that he once engaged in thuggish work on the party's behalf.
That tough-guy past, even his former association with the Central Intelligence Agency, seems to warm the hearts of many Iraqis who miss Mr. Hussein's iron-fisted ways.

''That Allawi worked for the C.I.A.
may be a problem for Americans,'' an Iraqi journalist said in conversation recently, ''but it is not a problem for Iraqis.''

IN his first week in office, Mr. Allawi came out fast and hard, signing a law that granted the government broad powers to quell dissent and disorder.
But in an equally significant way, Mr. Allawi signaled that he was prepared to reach an accommodation with many of those, including the former Baathists, who have been battling the American occupation.
He appears to be banking on the hope that ordinary Iraqis are appalled by the wanton slaughter of so many of their countrymen, in car bombings and terrorist attacks, and on the presumption that such attacks are largely the work of a relatively small number of home-grown Islamic fundamentalists, along with foreign terrorists like Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian suspected of masterminding many of the attacks on civilians.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Allawi said he was considering, among other things, an offer of amnesty to the guerrillas, who could be spared execution or prison in exchange for their cooperation and a promise to put down their guns.
''We can't give amnesty to, say, a criminal like Zarqawi,'' Mr. Allawi said last week.
''We have to bring him to justice.
But there are people who have been doing things around the periphery and who call themselves the resistance.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

''I spoke to some of them myself,'' Mr. Allawi continued.
''I told them: What are you trying to achieve?
Let us know.
Do you want to bring Saddam back to rule Iraq?
Do you want to bring bin Laden to rule Iraq?
We will fight you.
You can't do this.''
''You want to be part of the political process?''
he said, posing the crucial question.
''You are welcome to be part of the political process, provided that you sever your relations to the hard-core criminals and the terrorists.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

There are hints that at least some Sunni Arab leaders are seriously considering Mr. Allawi's offer.
There are signs, too, even dramatic ones, that fissures are opening up inside the Sunni-driven insurgency.
The success or failure of Mr. Allawi's efforts could ride on the extent to which he is perceived as being independent of the Americans, who have inadvertently united several disparate groups who oppose their presence here.

''Because they are Iraqis, we will give them a chance,'' Abdul-Sattar Abdul-Jabbar, a top Sunni cleric, said of the new government.

But Mr. Abdul-Jabbar is not bursting with optimism.
As long as American soldiers remain on Iraqi soil, he said, most Iraqis in the Sunni Triangle will withhold their approval of the new government.

''Is it the duty of the Iraqi national army to participate with the occupation, assisting them in bombing an Iraqi city?''
''This will make us all as Iraqis -- whether resistance or ordinary people -- mistrust them.''
But the suspicion appears to cut both ways.
The most important factor in determining the legitimacy of the new Iraqi government may turn out to be how far the Shiites are willing to let Mr. Allawi go.
Even some members of Mr. Allawi's government are skeptical of his efforts to bring the beneficiaries of Mr. Hussein's regime to heel.
''These people,'' Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Allawi's national security adviser and a Shiite, said of the Baathists, ''they have to be in charge.''
''Economic data over the next several weeks are likely to follow the theme of slower growth with continued inflationary pressures,'' wrote Andrew Tilton, an Goldman Sachs economist, in a note to clients.
''In addition to a weaker trend of consumer spending, we expect some modest deceleration in factory sector activity.''

But, despite the scattered straws in the wind, most economists remain confident that economic growth is not collapsing but is shifting to a lower, more sustainable rate.
''The economy has come off its peak in the last couple of months,'' said Martin A.
Regalia, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
''People have dropped their forecasts to about 3.5 percent.
That's still a pretty solid number.''
As the nation has rebounded from the recession of 2001, the main theme has been the ability of consumers to continue borrowing and spending.
Near record-low interest rates allowed homeowners to refinance their mortgages, taking money out of their homes to pay for renovations and all sorts of consumer durables.
First, a rising number of jobs would increase the overall wage pie -- helping maintain consumer spending.
Second, businesses, which spent the earlier part of the recovery paying down the debt amassed during the dot-com boom, would again start investing in new equipment.

Rising oil prices, however, have complicated this switch.
Spurring a jump in inflation and taking a big bite out of the wallets of consumers, rising energy prices have raised the question of whether, combined with higher interest rates, they could depress consumer spending before the new sources of growth could gather sufficient steam.

Signs of the end of consumers' exuberance have popped up in several areas.
And there is anecdotal evidence of dreary sales in June.

''Now the only real positive for the consumer is income and job growth,'' Mr. Harris at Lehman said.
''If the labor market really slows down it would be a blow to the consumer and we could talk of growth slipping to below trend.''
But it is still too early to make that call.
Indeed, Mr. Harris and most Wall Street economists view the June employment report as an aberration, and believe job growth will return to a more robust growth trend in July.
If this is true, the economic recovery might do fine.
Other data foreshadowing emerging weakness might just be a function of the changing sources of economic growth; not a signal of its demise.

''We've gone from an economy on life support driven by super aggressive 'refi' to one driven by more traditional sources of consumer income, which are jobs,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig.
''In the transition, we may see a change in the sectors that do best.''
Many economic variables remain strong.
Personal income, a major driver of consumer spending, is growing.
Mortgage applications are still increasing.
Home sales are at record levels.
The Institute of Supply Management's Purchasing Managers Index -- historically an accurate gauge of manufacturing activity -- is indicating only a mild slowdown in the second half from a strong period of expansion in the first.
Moreover, with interest rates still near their all-time lows it is harder to build a case for a sudden economic retrenchment than to explain continued growth.

The economy ''is firing on all cylinders and the structure of interest rates is still crazy easy,'' Mr. Barbera said.
Given that backdrop, he added, ''I'm willing to cast a blind eye to the past 30 days' data.''

In sharp contrast, Mr. Blair -- by far the closest ally of Mr. Bush in the war -- acknowledged last week that those supposed weapons might never be found.
''I'm afraid I don't accept that at all,'' he said.
''I think it's very difficult to look at Iraq today, to look at Iraq under Saddam, and say we would be better off, the world would be safer, we would be more secure if Saddam was still in charge of Iraq.''
The Butler inquiry is to report on the ''structures, processes and systems'' used in gathering prewar intelligence and the quality of that information in light of the failure to discover illicit weapons since the fall of Baghdad.

Mr. Blair's government has already been cleared in an earlier report by Lord Hutton last January of charges that it made a deliberate effort to deceive the British public about the threat from Iraq.
Despite that finding, the continued instability in Iraq has brought the most serious slide in Mr. Blair's standing since his election in 1997.

While British intelligence-gathering is expected to be criticized in the report, it is unclear whether the report will claim political casualties, to the consternation of some of Mr. Blair's critics.
''Tony Blair should admit that he was wrong about the size, scope and capacity of Iraq's W.M.D.
arsenal,'' said Charles Kennedy, the leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, referring to illicit weapons.
''He can't just put his mistakes on hold.''
British news reports have speculated on the report's likely findings about several senior officials, including John Scarlett, former chairman of the government's Joint Intelligence Committee, who has since been appointed head of the MI6 spy agency, and Jonathan Powell, Mr. Blair's chief of staff.
Mr. Blair's troubles have again raised questions about his ability to win a third term in elections, which may be held next spring.

PRESIDENT BUSH

Remarks yesterday at a rally in Waukesha, Wis.

''Tax relief is working.
It's working.
Since last summer our economy has been growing at its fastest rate in nearly 20 years.
As Tommy [G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services and former Wisconsin governor] said, since last August we've added 1.5 million new jobs.
People are going back to work.
Here in Wisconsin, the unemployment rate has dropped to 5.1 percent.
Homeownership rate is at an all-time high.
That's a fantastic statistic, isn't it?
We want more people owning their own home.
When you own something you have a vital stake in the future of the United States of America.
Interest rates are low; business investment is growing; consumer confidence is at a two-year high; personal incomes are up.
The economic stimulus plan that we worked with Congress on is paying off.
This economy is strong, and it is getting stronger.
And there's a different view, of course.
That's what campaigns are all about.
My opponents looked at this progress and somehow concluded the sky is falling.
It doesn't matter whether the message is delivered with a frown or a smile, it's the same old pessimism, same old pessimism.
And they're going to cheer us up with higher taxes, more federal spending and economic isolationism.
The good news is, we're not going to let them do that.
We're going to keep taxes low to make sure people can find work and people to be able to realize their dream.''
But while the Saturday night demo derby draws the big crowds, pulling in crash fiends from Great Falls and all over north-central Montana, the heart of the fair is the 4-H livestock show and the young people -- Ben and Jenna and the rest -- who make it happen.

Over three days, dozens of 4-H members parade their lambs and pigs and steers before judges, auction them for hundreds or even thousands of dollars, and then send them to slaughter.
The show caps a yearlong project designed to teach them the importance of sacrifice, in every sense of the word.
It is the reason that dozens of families spend the weekend living at the fairgrounds, camped in tents and R.V.

And it is where the fading dreams of the county lie.
The markets and the elements have been kind to Chouteau County this year, for a change.
Steer prices are at near record highs.
A seven-year drought has eased, the wheat heads are big and bursting, and the bluffs along the river have ripened to an unfamiliar velvety green.
But like most of rural America, Chouteau County (pronounced SHOW-toe) is emptying out.
Now, there are fewer than 800.
The livestock show is a way to persuade the next generation to stay on the farm.

''List some major purchases you see yourself making in your lifetime,'' read the directions on one page of ''Going Whole Hog.''
In the ''Five Years From Now'' essay, Jenna, who wants to be a chemical engineer, wrote: ''There will be no excess fat in sight anywhere on a piece of meat.
The animals produced will all be genetically modified to be the best.''

The first part of the contest was for showmanship.
To the untrained eye, a pig show looks chaotic and even a little comical.
The humans, bare-handed or carrying crops with leather paddles at the end, try, with mixed results, to keep their charges from wandering off into corners, rooting in the dirt and getting into squabbles.
Jenna, the defending showmanship champ and a starting guard on the high school basketball team, shadowed Pork as she would a backcourt opponent -- knees bent, arms and torso forward, a fierce expression on her face, anticipating the pig's every move.

Another contestant, Tanner Ripley, combined intensity with effortlessness.
''She's doing a really good job with this gilt,'' the term for a sow that hasn't been bred.
''She knows where the pig is at all times.''

Then Mr. Vandivort judged the animals themselves, mentally butchering them and ranking them for ''cutability'' and fullness of rump.
''This is a gilt I really like the design of,'' he said of Jenna's pig before awarding her another red ribbon for second place.
''I like the levelness down her top.
I like the expression of muscle.''

FOR decades, the Chouteau County Fair has been held at the end of August.
Between the dwindling under-age population and the tug of other entertainments, it gets harder each year for the fair organizers to persuade a carnival company to haul its rides to Fort Benton during the late-summer peak season.
But the bigger reason is that scourge of American youth, team sports.
They are increasingly popular, numerous and demanding of their participants' time.
In Montana, school has started earlier in the year to accommodate the expanding sports season, and even on the night of the pig weigh-in, Ben had to miss football camp to attend.
There are advantages to an early fair.
Families who were once tied to the farm all summer just to supervise their 4-H animals are now able to take vacations.
And less time to raise the livestock means less danger of losing it before it can go to auction.
''This is their college tuition,'' said the fair's beef superintendent, Laurie McCullough.
''If these animals die during the summer, they're left with nothing.''

But for the locals who raise vegetables for the fair, the shift has been a disaster that the theme of this year's fair, ''The Tradition Continues'' (it's usually something snappier like ''A Family A-Fair'' or ''A Fair With Flair''), does nothing to disguise.

''I'm not going to get in trouble with your mother.
You can slip him out of here when I'm gone.''
If they backed out of selling the lamb, 4-H might not let Christina's brother, Tony, 9, show a steer next year.

The full explanation lay next door in the pig barn, where Tony's pig, Gunnar, slept.
Gunnar, formerly Digger, was recently renamed for Gunnar Collins, a 17-year-old from California whom the family had taken in and who taught the children the fine points of showing pigs (which include, oddly enough, shaving them).
''We've just lost Gunnar,'' said Mr. Butler, a fire inspector in Great Falls, ''and now Amos, this family member who we've grown to love, we're taking him off to slaughter.''
SUNDAY morning, the fairgoers filed into the grandstand for worship service, conducted on a platform in front of a muddy track still torn up from the demo derby the night before, backed by the green bluffs above the river and a cloudless sky.
The minister, the Rev.
Marvin Eldridge, urged the audience to pray with eyes open so they could take in the beauty.
''As we see the sights and hear the sounds and, yes, even smell the smells,'' Mr. Eldridge said, ''we're thankful for life.''

In the steer pen, a few of the older boys took a dip in the steers' plastic water tank.
''They're not going to drink out of that water now,'' Renee Kotthoff, a 4-H mom, said of the livestock.
''You guys haven't had a bath in two days.''
''It's O.K.
to have this fantasy that you're going to save him, Christina,'' she said, ''but you can't live in a fantasy world.
Reality is where you live.
So if you're going to make up a fantasy, make one up about what happens to him once he goes on the truck.''
For the last few years, the 4-H animals have sold for considerably over market price, with prices driven up by proud relatives and by local businesses vying to curry favor with loyal or potential customers.

Mr. Putin also removed officials responsible for security in the Caucasus, including the commander of Interior Ministry forces, the region's top military commander and a deputy leader of the Federal Security Service, the successor of the K.G.B.

Analysts described the public firing of a senior officer from the Federal Security Service as an atypical gesture for a president who is a former spy himself, and has remained closely identified with the nation's intelligence services.
Last month, Mr. Putin trimmed General Kvashnin's role by a presidential decree that reorganized the military's leadership, making the general staff subordinate to the Ministry of Defense and responsible for analysis and planning rather than operational command.

Problems are endemic in Russia's armed forces.

Training budgets are so limited that General Kvashnin said in an interview last year that many Russian pilots, who require at least 100 hours of flight time each year to maintain their skills, were flying as little as six hours a year.
Similarly, for several years the training exercises for ground forces have been less elaborate and frequent than before.

''If economic developments are such that monetary policy neutrality can be restored at a measured pace, a relatively smooth adjustment of businesses and households to a more typical level of interest rates seems likely,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
Many analysts, particularly in the bond markets, have sharply criticized the Fed for keeping interest rates too low for too long and ignoring signs of incipient inflation.

In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan reiterated his view that recent price increases are mainly a result of ''transitory factors,'' like higher oil prices.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

He also expanded on his view that corporate profits have been so high that businesses have ample room to offer higher wages without raising prices to consumers.

The surprisingly tentative tone of his outlook contrasted with Mr. Greenspan's more extended attempt in his testimony on Tuesday to buttress his view that core inflation, which excludes volatile areas like food and energy prices, is likely to remain below 2 percent through the end of next year.
But despite his optimism about inflation remaining under wraps, Mr. Greenspan cautioned investors against thinking that the Fed might feel less constrained in unwinding its cheap-money policies of the last three years.

The Fed predicted that annual growth in 2004 would be 4.25 to 4.75 percent, down slightly from its forecast in February that growth could reach 5 percent.
The Fed predicted that core inflation would range from 1.5 percent to 2 percent in 2005, which is at the highest boundary of what Fed officials consider acceptable.

Though Mr. Greenspan predicted that the job market would continue to improve, the Fed predicted that the unemployment rate would decline only slightly from 5.6 percent last month to about 5 to 5.25 percent at the end of 2005.
''For the moment, the modest upward path of unit labor costs does not appear to threaten longer-term price stability,'' he continued.
But he carefully repeated his warning about ''uncertainties'' and said the Federal Reserve ''will continue to pay close attention to incoming data, especially on costs and prices.''

As always, Mr. Greenspan took pains to leave his options open.
He carefully dodged an opening question from Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, on whether the Fed would raise the federal funds rate another quarter-point at its August meeting.
He also refused to be pinned down on what is in many ways the most basic question: What constitutes a ''neutral'' interest rate that neither provokes inflation nor slows down the economy?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Many economists have suggested that a ''neutral'' fed funds rate -- the rate charged on overnight loans between banks and the key policy tool the Fed relies on to guide the economy -- is 4 percent to 5 percent.
That would be a big increase from today's level of 1.25 percent.

''You can tell whether you're below or above, but until you're there, you're not quite sure you are there,'' he said.

But the authority's tax receipts from real estate transactions have been much greater than expected, with the residential mortgage market booming over the past year.
As of the end of June, that subsidy has brought returns of $137 million, or 63 percent, more than the authority budgeted for this year.
Similarly, a subsidy drawn from taxes levied on commercial real estate sales has delivered $36 million, or 43 percent, more than expected.

''It's built on these historic low interest rates that we never would have forecasted or budgeted,'' Stephen Kessler, authority's chief financial officer, said yesterday, explaining that transit officials try to be conservative with estimates of subsidy income.
The budget draft to be released next week will be finalized in December.
Fuel prices have also been skyrocketing, so tax receipts on petroleum sales are up $36 million over budget as of the end of June as well.
All told, the surplus for the fuel and real estate subsidies is $209 million.

Transportation officials also would not say whether the windfall would affect their original plans to raise $227 million in additional revenue through an increase in MetroCard prices or other fares and tolls.
Although some of the extra funds could come from attracting more riders, those increases are usually only at the margins.

The slowdown of the economy in June, which Mr. Greenspan said this week was temporary, is more on the minds of investors than the growth of more than 3.5 percent so far this year.
And the threat of higher inflation, which Mr. Greenspan said the Fed would step in quickly to quell, seems to obscure the fact that corporate earnings increased 27.5 percent in the first quarter and are forecast to rise 24 percent for the second quarter.

After Mr. Northrup retired in 2002 he began transcribing the verses of his favorite authors.
''I look for something that's dramatic and flows beautifully, and I try to reproduce that visually,'' he said.
For his winning entry, he copied the words of Michael R. Sull, who owns a studio specializing in ornamental penmanship, calligraphy and lettering design.
In graceful letters slanting to the right, Mr. Northrup's sample ended, ''Necessary in every age, handwriting remains just as vital to the enduring saga of civilization as our next breath.''
The paper, ink and type of pen must all be considered before committing to the piece.
''A ballpoint pen in your hand is the same as a ballpoint pen in mine,'' he said.
''But with a fountain pen, it's how you press and where you press, and how flexible the point is.
There's more opportunity to show individuality.''
Mr. Northrup uses fountain pens with nibs of various widths and ink of many colors.
He has no desire to mass-produce or sell his work, teach a class or even admonish others for their poor writing.
After all, he said, he is not beyond dashing off a note that is reminiscent of his college days.
He said empathetically, ''You should see my shopping lists.''
Knowing how to sample and taste dark brown liquid -- known as cupping in the trade -- is indispensable for producing quality coffee.
And producing gourmet coffee, the sort that will command top dollar in the United States, offers Rwanda a way out of the falling coffee prices caused by skyrocketing production that has affected all the world's producers since the mid-1990's and impoverished the peasants who engage in the backbreaking work of coffee cultivation.

As the overall coffee market has stagnated, specialty coffee -- the trade term for the high-quality brew served by Starbucks and other upscale retailers -- has hit its stride.
Retail sales in the United States have remained steady at about $20 billion, but specialty coffee has accounted for an ever-larger chunk of that market, 45 percent last year, up from 38 percent in 1999 and sharply less than that a decade earlier, according to the Specialty Coffee Association of America.
Coffee producers in Kenya and Ethiopia, which are known for coffee quality, have profited handsomely.
Rwandan coffee producers, heavily aided by Western governments, are seeking not only to tap the specialty market, but also to assure a just distribution of the rewards.
This assistance, furnished largely by the United States Agency for International Development, may eventually determine which approach best promotes broad-based economic growth: assistance for farmer collectives or credits for nimble entrepreneurs.

Ms. Mukabavugirije has a role in the first approach.
Her coffee cooperative, from the Maraba region of southern Rwanda, stands at the center of the American-backed Project Pearl; its goal is to make organized groups of farmers the hubs on which Rwanda's coffee industry would turn.

If cooperatives can ensure quality, the farmers who form them will reap the benefits.
Although few people here know the formal name, Pearl stands for Partnership to Enhance Agriculture in Rwanda through Linkages.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Most importantly, Project Pearl has bankrolled the construction of a coffee-washing station that is owned by the Maraba cooperative.
Rwanda's high altitude and rich soil provide the natural resources for good coffee, and a washing station finishes the job that nature begins.
Consisting of pulping machines, washing basins and drying tables, the station extracts from the red coffee ''cherry'' the two light green beans that can be roasted and ground.
Without washing, the fruit ferments on the bean, giving the final product an unpleasant taste.
Project Pearl has also arranged for American and European roasters like Mr. Leach to travel to Rwanda and instruct farmers in coffee cupping.

''We're not trying to turn them into coffee rocket scientists,'' said Tim Schilling, the American director of Project Pearl.
''They need to monitor quality.''

In addition to its own direct aid, which costs a total of $10 million, Project Pearl has facilitated grants from the World Bank, help from nongovernmental organizations, free advice from local universities, and in-kind help from the Rwandan government, including the land for Maraba's washing station.
By all accounts Rwandan cooperatives have leaned heavily on Mr. Schilling, whose energetic work has animated the process for nearly four years, and he is expected to continue his work here at least through 2007.

Juvenal Nkusi, who also works in the coffee industry, is part of the entrepreneurial approach.
Mr. Nkusi, 40, comes from a family that has cultivated coffee for two generations, and owns a plantation with 110,000 bushes -- an enormous size for Rwanda.
Thanks to another project supported by the United States government to encourage and help entrepreneurs, Adar (short for its French name Assistance à la Dynamisation de l'Agribusiness au Rwanda), Mr. Nkusi built a washing station two years ago, and now processes coffee cherries from his farm in eastern Rwanda, and buys more cherries from both individual cultivators and several area cooperatives.

Mr. Nkusi took out a $150,000 loan at a hefty 16 percent interest rate to build his washing station, and he takes sole responsibility for ensuring the quality of the final product, and is entitled to the profits.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

''On paper, an association is perfect,'' said Maurice Wiener, chief of Adar.
''But I'm skeptical of the reality.''
Adar costs $10.5 million, but leaves out the additions that make Project Pearl a much more expensive undertaking.
Since Project Pearl puts a premium on just rewards for farmers, it can rightly claim some early successes.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But in Mr. Nkusi's work, Adar, too, can claim to have found a workable model.
From minimal production last year, Mr. Nkusi's washing station accelerated to produce 30 tons of coffee this year.
And he notes with satisfaction that more farmers in his region are turning to coffee, some by stealing coffee plants from his own plantation.

''I have no problem with that,'' he said.
''If the coffee's good, they'll come to me for processing.''
Ultimately, though, Rwanda's customers in the United States and Europe will deliver the final verdict on who makes the best coffee.
Geoff Watts, vice president of Chicago-based Intelligentsia Coffee, began buying Rwandan coffee last year, and has found its cooperatives have delivered a quality product consistently, but Mr. Watts said that over time, their leadership tends to change, irritating customers who are looking for stable business relationships.

''The guys you're talking to this year may not be the ones you deal with next year,'' Mr. Watts said.
Mr. Leach, having traipsed through Rwanda's hills and slurped coffee alongside its farmers, is agnostic on the matter of co-ops or entrepreneurs.
Good coffee is good coffee, no matter its origin.

The battle for mutual respect, she said, can only be won by ending the divisive hatred spawned by religious leaders who pervert and distort the message of the Bible.

What they do share of Stubbs's work is the streak of romanticism that the older artist sometimes pursued, as in several paintings of a lion attacking a horse or other animal in desolate surroundings.

Ward arrived at animal portraiture after working as a printmaker specializing in mezzotint.
He began painting in oil about 1790, starting out with the rustic subject matter that he knew.
He also did animal portraits for private clients, and about 1798 he began working for the newly established Board of Agriculture on an extensive documentary project, depicting particular breeds of farm animals.
Among those shown here, along with some of the careful drawings from nature made on his travels through the countryside, is ''Ryelands Sheep: The King's Ram, the King's Ewe and Lord Somerville's Wether'' (circa 1801), a portrait of three upscale woolbearers painted during a week spent at Windsor Castle.
Stoically standing in a landscape, the two royal sheep, belonging to George III, and a wether (a gelded male) owned by Lord Somerville, president of the agricultural board, represented a new and improved breed of English livestock descended from Herefords, according to the painting's caption.
The boundless belly of this one alone could stoke an army of Englishmen.

Ward began portraying horses shortly after the death of Stubbs in 1806 and another famous equine portraitist, Sawrey Gilpin, in 1807.
He is said to have turned to the genre in response to a cutting remark of his artist brother-in-law that good as he was with rustic subjects, ''he can no more paint blood horses than my boot.''

An oil of 1815-20 portrays a truly magnificent ''Gray Arabian Stallion,'' the property of a rich landowner, Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn.
Tail bobbed, mane combed, and bulging with powerful muscles, the stallion is seen not in open countryside but in a dense forest, a fairy tale steed seemingly conjured up by a magic word.
The top-hatted, red-coated (but realistically mud-stained) Levett, having made it to a hilltop before the pack of hounds and other hunters, sits majestically on his mount, dramatically gesturing toward the fleeing fox as a lush English countryside rolls out invitingly behind him.
In 1804, urged by Benjamin West to paint ''something large and striking,'' he finished a life-size canvas titled ''The Liboya Serpent Seizing His Prey'' for submission to the Academy's annual show.
(A study for it is shown here.)

But it was turned down by the hanging committee on grounds of its size (the final canvas was nearly 10 by 14 feet), its ''outlandishness'' and its ''staring'' quality.
Ward did make it into the Academy by 1811, still striving toward recognition as a history painter.
Today his masterpiece is considered to be ''Gordale Scar'' (circa 1811-12), a wild and rocky natural setting in West Yorkshire visited by Romantic tourists, but so dark and dense it was considered unpaintable.
Challenged, Ward captured the scene in an enormous oil -- 11 by 14 feet -- that is now apparently about to emerge from storage at Tate Britain.
The only presence of the ''Scar'' in this show is a tiny, quite unreadable sketch that might have been made to secure the patronage of a noble whose estate was nearby.
But those of us who haven't seen the full rendition must make do with Ward's ardent tributes to sheep, dogs and horses.

In a speech at a campaign stop in Springfield, Mo., Mr. Bush did not mention the latest snapshot of the nation's economic performance.
Instead, he urged support for his policies by stressing that the economy has grown relatively briskly for about a year, adding more than 1.5 million jobs since last August.
''We have more to do to make America's economy stronger,'' Mr. Bush said.
Treasury Secretary John Snow portrayed the gross domestic product report as evidence of ''an economy growing at a steady pace.''
By contrast, Jason Furman, an economic adviser in Senator Kerry's campaign, said that the slowdown in growth ''makes it harder for them to make the argument that Bush's economic strategy is working.''

Mr. Furman added that the latest evidence ''rebuts their argument that the economy is getting better and better.''

Beyond the political positioning, the data painted a mixed scenario.
Changes in consumer spending -- which counts for roughly two-thirds of economic output -- caused virtually all of the deceleration in the second quarter.
''The consumer is overextended,'' said Charles Dumas, chief international economist at Lombard Street Research in London.

Other parts of the economy, however, fared much better.
Residential construction continued at a sizzling pace, growing by 10 percent compared with the first quarter of the year as still-low interest rates continued to fuel the housing market.

Companies also stepped up their investment in new equipment, with business spending growing by 8.9 percent -- almost double the rate of the previous quarter.
Exports also grew at a much faster pace, benefiting from a weaker dollar.

The government contribution to the economy waned, too, constrained by a budget deficit that is now predicted to reach $445 billion by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

For the economic expansion to return to brisker growth, businesses will need to pick up the baton from consumers -- investing more in capital equipment and adding more jobs so that income growth from wages and salaries can in turn refuel spending.

Job growth, however, took a dip in June, expanding by barely 112,000, less than necessary to absorb the natural growth of the labor force.
''The negative factors are building up,'' Mr. Dumas said.
Some economists suggested, however, that the soft patch in the second quarter is more likely to be temporary than a serious roadblock to sustained growth.
Indeed, the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the effects of food and energy, rose only 2.4 percent, lower than in the previous quarter.

Robert Barbera, chief economist at IG Hoenig, argued that with oil prices currently hovering around $40 a barrel, they were unlikely to go much higher.
''The energy price effect,'' he said, is ''a one-time squeeze on purchasing power.''

Mr. Barbera further added that current low inventories bode well for the future.
They would allow businesses to react quickly to signs of increasing demand, immediately ramping up production, investing in capital equipment and hiring more workers.
Several other signs also point to a rebound in economic growth.
Weekly jobless claims stayed comfortably under 350,000 in July, a level that often suggests robust employment gains.
Recent indicators suggest the pace of manufacturing is picking up again.

Mr. Gault, the economist, agreed -- to a point.

Yet one man's ''financial train wreck,'' to borrow Mr. Menlow's phrase, is another's rare chance to magically transform a modest stash of cash into a single-stock retirement fund.
''Google might look ridiculously expensive,'' said Michael Moe, the chief executive of ThinkEquity Partners, a research-oriented investment bank specializing in growth industries.
''But Microsoft, Cisco, Qualcomm -- take your pick.

Investing in a newly minted stock is always risky.
More than 5,000 companies went public between 1989 and 2000, according to Richard J. Peterson, chief market strategist for Thomson First Call.
Nearly one-third of those companies are down 50 percent or more since their stock market debut, Mr. Peterson said -- if they are even still in business.
Only one-fifth are worth at least twice their opening day price.
Moreover, this year has been a terrible one for technology companies new to the stock market.

Google is hardly just another company seeking to sell shares on the stock market.
But, then, that is already reflected in the share price, which is expected to be the highest ever for an initial public offering.
Even assuming that Google sells initially for $108 per share, that would make the company worth 150 times its last four quarters of earnings.
By contrast, its Internet rival, Yahoo, is valued at 105 times earnings, and Microsoft 39 times earnings.

Still, Barry Randall, a mutual fund manager, is among those thinking about taking the plunge.
The company's balance sheets, at least at quick glance, he said, are compelling.
According to Google's most recent filing, it has a gross profit margin ''in the high 80 percent range,'' said Mr. Randall, who runs the First American Technology Fund, which specializes in technology stocks.
Still, it seems legitimate to ask if any company, no matter how extraordinary, should trade at such sky-high multiples.
As even Google acknowledges in its S.E.C.
Moreover, Google can maintain its torrid rate of growth -- which it must do to justify so extravagant a stock market valuation -- only if it increases traffic on its site.
That is no easy task given that it's already the default search engine for much of the world.
(That explains recent initiatives like Gmail, a free e-mail service from Google that challenges offerings by Yahoo and Microsoft.)

''The company's valuation is clearly based more on the hype factor than business fundamentals,'' said Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst at Raymond James & Company.
Unlike many of the Internet companies that came to life at the end of the last decade, Google turns a sizable profit ($79 million in the second quarter of 2004, up 147 percent from a year earlier).
But Mr. Kumar nonetheless concluded that its pricing ''harkens back to the late 90's boom.''

As many people learned the hard way after the bubble burst in 2000, the stock market value of a technology company is not based as much on its intrinsic worth as on an assessment of its future earning power.
How one answers when asked to consider the wisdom of investing in Google, then, seems to say as much about that individual's faith in the technology sector generally as about his or her view of Google.

''Basically we're looking at your classic bull versus bear tussle over Google for a long time to come,'' Mr. Moe said.
Mr. Moe is among those who say they believe the technology sector is undervalued.
Then there is Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist in Nashua, N.H., and a longtime technology stock analyst who stands out as perhaps the most bearish of them all.
To him, the steep price Google has assigned itself is proof that the stock market has not shaken off the excesses of the bubble.

''Look at history,'' Mr. Hickey said.
''There's never been valuations of 100 times revenues, except during this bubble.''
Mr. Hickey concedes that there is a certain logic to Google's price.
The pricing of a stock on Wall Street is not unlike that of the real estate market, where the worth of a property is set largely by recent sales prices of like properties, or ''comps.''
Yahoo, the other large company that sells advertising tied to Internet searches, seems to be everyone's favorite comp to justify Google's valuation.
''Everyone is playing the 'relative-to' game,'' Mr. Hickey said.
''Google has a reasonable valuation if you assume its fellow Internet stocks, like Yahoo, are reasonably priced.
The problem is, as we saw in March 2000, that game works -- but only for a while.''

Mr. Kumar is not nearly as dour in his assessment of technology's future as Mr. Hickey, but he, too, says he is inclined to believe that technology sector valuations are generally too high.
And he is hardly alone in that assessment, he said.
''Most portfolio managers are underweighting technology,'' Mr. Kumar said, ''because they don't feel the reward of the upside is commensurate with the downside risk.''
Technology companies account for roughly 16 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, yet by his calculations, technology stocks account for between 13 and 14 percent of the overall basket of stocks held by portfolio managers.

Apparently, Wade Slome, co-manager of the American Century Ultra Fund, a $22 billion growth stock mutual fund, is braver than much of his cohort.

''I THINK people are a little too pessimistic, given all the uncertainties,'' Mr. Slome said.
''Whether you're talking the election, Iraq, inflation or interest rates, there's so many things for people to worry about.''
It's no surprise, then, that Mr. Slome plans to take a hard look at Google.
Whether he will actually make a bid, though, is unclear.
Typically, institutional money mangers like him set a stock's opening price in the rarefied world of I.P.O.'s.
Google, however, is selling shares to the public in an unconventional Internet-based auction that puts the public on equal footing with the professionals.

That is what worries Mr. Menlow of the IPO Financial Network.
He is convinced that institutional investors will largely shun the Google offering, allowing the wider public to price the deal.
''That's dangerous on a hot deal,'' Mr. Menlow said.
''You have to price a deal based on some kind of financial model, not the highest price people are willing to pay in a supercharged environment.''
''I don't want make any disparaging remarks about the individual investors,'' he said, ''but when you entrust the pricing of a company to amateurs, people end up getting hurt.''

Consumer spending is growing faster than expected this year almost everywhere in Europe, with the notable exception of Germany, said Holger Schmieding, an economist with Banc of America Securities who is based in London.
Many Europeans are experiencing a ''bit of a feel-good factor,'' Mr. Schmieding said, as rising home values make their owners feel wealthy, pushing them to spend, and even take out loans for big purchases.
Home prices have more than doubled in Britain and Spain since 1997, and are up almost 60 percent in France over the same time period.

''Investment and public sector consumption have both grown strongly and demand in U.K. export markets continues to pick up,'' which could lead to rising inflationary pressures, the bank said.
Heather Timmons (NYT)
There is no sugarcoating yesterday's employment report.
The report's immediate impact will be to neutralize, if not undercut, President Bush's campaign boasts of a strong economic recovery.
Mr. Bush runs the risk of being the first president since Herbert Hoover to preside over a net decline in the number of jobs.
This may not be all his fault; he inherited a bursting bubble, after all, and there are limits to a president's ability to counter economic cycles.
But Mr. Bush is always just as eager to have the buck stop at his desk to take credit for good economic news as he is to deny or spin bad news.
Addressing a conference of minority journalists in Washington, President Bush was unwilling to acknowledge the implications of the jobs report.
''Economic growth is strong and it's getting stronger,'' he said.
The disappointing numbers come on top of -- and help explain -- other recent signs of a slowdown, including an abrupt drop in economic growth, to a 3 percent annual rate in the second quarter from 4.5 percent in this year's first quarter.
Financial markets reacted bearishly to the latest news, with stock market indexes hitting new lows for the year yesterday, and the dollar weakening against other currencies.

The Federal Reserve Board is also unable to come to the rescue because it is rightly concerned about the danger of keeping short-term interest rates below the rate of inflation.
Next week, Alan Greenspan and his colleagues are expected to continue on their course of gradually inching up rates, which have been at emergency-level lows.
This may turn into a sequel of the 1992 tensions between the Fed chairman and a Bush White House that wants looser monetary policy on the eve of an election.
Most economic forecasts have predicted a healthy economy in the second half of the year, and consumer surveys have been bullish, even as people have trimmed their spending.
The trouble is, companies will have to start adding at least 200,000 new jobs a month to justify this optimism, especially now that the government's ability to apply a fiscal or monetary stimulus is so constrained.
Those stubbornly high fuel prices show how external shocks can slam the brakes on the pace of this recovery.

Because most of these films deal with mind control, with loss of identity, the genre has an almost voluptuous aura of defeatism.
If some omnipotent force -- Global.com or SuperMom -- has reduced you to impotence, turned you back into a helpless child, then you might as well learn to enjoy it.

These movies uncannily seem to understand an impulse viewers both recognize and resist.
The specter of male impotence is at the heart of the matter, as are stories of wobbly men and take-charge women.
In ''The Bourne Identity'' (and ''Supremacy''), as in ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' men are programmed to become killers, suggesting that one theme in these ambivalently bellicose times is how do you turn a nice liberal boy -- Matt Damon, Liev Schreiber -- into a murderer?
Both protagonists have blank moments -- Who am I and why am I killing these people?
-- in scary recognition of the possibility of multiple disconnected selves.
But these films also tell viewers that Someone Is Watching Over Us.
Conspiracy offers an antidote to chaos.
Instead of unpredictable terrorists, true aliens in our midst, we have ''people like us'' only more extreme: logical tacticians with scientific plans to take over the world.
They don't want to kill us, only change us ''a little bit.''

Mr. Wurtzel's facetiousness was matched by a real sense of vindication.
The decreases in viewing were seen in all kinds of areas, including professional football games and late-night comedy shows, traditional staples for younger men.
''Usage numbers move glacially,'' Mr. Wurtzel said.
''Double-digit declines just don't happen.''
The dispute has had significant financial implications.
Nielsen, owned by VNU, enjoys a monopoly in delivering ratings information, which determines how an estimated $40 billion in television advertising revenue is spent each year.
''We lost inventory we can never regain,'' Mr. Wurtzel said -- and all for a measurement, he argued, that should have been dismissed as bogus to begin with.

But Nielsen executives do not agree that last year's ratings were wrong.

He added, ''The numbers suggest that young men are watching more television this year, after they watched less last year.''
Among the programming attracting young men, are repeats of Comedy Central's biggest hit, ''Chappelle's Show,'' and numerous hours devoted to poker on cable.
To Nielsen's critics -- who mostly reside at the broadcast networks, because they have the most revenue to lose -- the ratings company is consistently maddening.
But undoing Nielsen's monopoly status would be prohibitively expensive.
The networks tried in the late 1990's with a company called Smart, run by Statistical Research Inc.
And there are no plans to try again.

Critics acknowledge that what Nielsen is trying to do -- accurately measure a passive behavior like watching television -- is inherently difficult.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It is especially difficult with young men, they say, because that group is the least likely to do what Nielsen wants: cooperate with a system that demands they push buttons every time they watch TV or change channels.
What makes it worse, the critics say, is that young men are now more likely to be living with their parents, but may do most of their television viewing away from home.

This is hardly the first time that discrepancies have turned up in the ratings.
While Nielsen always defends its numbers as accurate, over time the measurements typically return to their normal levels.
Critics say that Nielsen must have tinkered with its methodology in those instances; Nielsen denies doing so.
Within a few months, the numbers started to swing back.

After last year's report of declining viewership, Nielsen executives suggested larger cultural reasons for the trend.
Nielsen sent a memorandum to clients, speculating that one possible cause was the increase in the number of young men playing video games and watching DVD's.
A Nielsen spokesman, Jack Loftus, even speculated that the number of young men off fighting the war in Iraq might be affecting the numbers.
That especially enraged network executives.
''Besides being ridiculous on its face,'' said David F. Poltrack, the executive vice president for research for CBS, ''they could have checked the Iraq thing easily by just polling their measurement sample to see how many young men from those families had gone to Iraq.''

To many network executives, the Iraq explanation was typical of the way Nielsen has grabbed at culture change to try to explain statistical anomalies.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Now, Mr. Wurtzel noted, the same young men have suddenly found television to their liking again -- and, he said, ''it doesn't seem like all that many of them have made it back from Iraq yet.''
With its heavy schedule of ''Chappelle's Show,'' for example, Comedy Central's ratings have risen more than 50 percent this summer, while on the Discovery Channel, young men seem to be watching the show ''American Chopper'' in big numbers.
On the networks, Fox's ''The Simple Life'' and ''Trading Spouses'' have performed well.

Then again, television had plenty of hits last summer as well, including NBC's ''For Love or Money'' and Bravo's ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.''

Nielsen's reluctance to admit error drives its critics to distraction.
''The sample is in the best shape it has ever been in,'' Mr. Donato said.
What about all those sweeping statements last year about how the drop-off in viewing pointed to long-term cultural change?

American forces have an overwhelming military edge in firepower and in numbers over Mr. Sadr's guerrillas.
But Mr. Sadr's control of the Imam Ali Mosque here, one of the holiest sites in Shiite Islam, has frustrated American efforts to crush his movement.
American commanders worry that the mosque could be damaged by fighting, or even destroyed by sabotage from Mr. Sadr's side, causing outrage among Shiites, who constitute the majority of Iraqis.

American commanders are walking both a military and political tightrope in Najaf.
They have tried to draw out the Sadr militia and have threatened to destroy it if it does not disband.
But again on Wednesday, the Americans hesitated to attack the militia in its base in Najaf's old city, where the mosque is situated.
The tensions in Najaf are the first major test of the relationship between the American military and Ayad Allawi, who became prime minister of the interim government in June and whose approval is needed for any attack on Mr. Sadr.
Dr. Allawi came to Najaf on Sunday saying he would not negotiate with Sadr forces.
But his assent to an all-out assault is another matter, and it is not known whether he will approve attacking Mr. Sadr in Najaf's old city.

As the battle drags on, American forces faced new calls from Iraq's interim vice president and Shiite political groups to stop the fighting.

After a week of fighting here, the situation on the ground has not decisively changed.
American forces have battled insurgents in Najaf's huge cemetery but have not pushed south into the old city, where Mr. Sadr keeps his headquarters.

On Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr. Sadr vowed that the cleric would continue his fight in Najaf.
''The battles will last till the last drop of our blood,'' Talal al-Saadi, the spokesman, said at an interview in Baghdad.
''We will never withdraw and won't leave.''
Over the last year, Mr. Sadr, a 31-year-old cleric whose father, Muhammad, was honored by poor Shiites, has become the leading opponent of the American Army, though he is a divisive figure, opposing both the Americans and the current government.
While fighting has been mostly confined to the enormous cemetery on the western edge of the city, sporadic clashes have occurred elsewhere, too, and on Tuesday American troops warned residents to evacuate much of the city.
Now the streets of Najaf and Kufa, a town a few miles to the east that is another Sadr stronghold, are largely deserted.
Some families have fled the cities, while others are staying indoors, where they are often short of electricity in 120-degree heat.
Many families are running out of food, and prices are rising because of sporadic shortages, said a store owner who asked to be identified as Abu Nabaa, or father of Nabaa.

''The people of Najaf are so tired and fed up with these battles,'' Mr. Nabaa said in a telephone interview.
Najaf, which is dependent on spending by Shiite pilgrims traveling to the Imam Ali shrine, prospered last year after the Americans eased restrictions on pilgrims imposed by Saddam Hussein.
Now the pilgrimages have again ground to a halt.

''Najaf's people and tribes hold him responsible for what is going in their city now,'' Mr. Nabaa said of Mr. Sadr.
''I can say that 90 percent of the people here hate him.''

Mr. Sadr seems to have more supporters in Kufa, where he used to preach.
''Once we are given an order to fight, the whole world will not stop us from doing so,'' he said.

Civilian casualties in Najaf continue to rise.
About 25 civilians have died and 146 others have been wounded in the last week, said Dr. Falah al-Muhanna, Najaf's health commissioner.
Fighting has prevented ambulances from reaching the wounded, and doctors and nurses have been blocked from the hospital.
The Army and Marines claim to have killed about 500 insurgents, although Mr. Sadr's militia says the true number is much lower.
Four marines have been killed, and about two dozen more have been wounded.

After the American military's abrupt change in plans on Wednesday, the stalemate shows no signs of ending.
During a two-month fight with Mr. Sadr's militia this spring, American forces repeatedly backed off after closing in on Mr. Sadr.
''Iraqi and U.S. forces are making final preparations as we get ready to finish this fight that the Moktada militia started,'' Col. Anthony M. Haslam, commanding officer of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit in Najaf, said in a statement early Wednesday, while an attack still seemed imminent.
''The desired end state is one of stability and security, where the citizens of Najaf do not live in fear of violence or kidnappings.''

To prove their seriousness, American commanders moved two Army battalions, with almost 2,000 troops, to augment the 1,000 marines already in Najaf.
Several hundred Iraqi national guard troops are here but are playing a small role.

''Preparations to do the offensive are taking longer than initially anticipated,'' Major Holahan said.
The fighting this week coincides with the rare absence from Najaf of the most revered Shiite leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the head of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, who is a mainstream cleric wary of the American role but not in violent opposition to it as Mr. Sadr is.

Mr. Sadr's guerrillas have battled the Iraqi police and American forces for more than a year, and last year an Iraqi judge issued a secret warrant for Mr. Sadr's arrest on charges of murdering a moderate Shiite cleric.

One thought is to change the system so that it focuses less on taxing what people earn and more on taxing what they spend.
Even without a sales tax, this could be accomplished by letting people deduct money they put in savings and investments from their income, so they would owe taxes only on what was left -- in other words, essentially on what they spent.

Administration officials are also looking for ways to flesh out the theme of promoting an ''ownership society'' -- dusting off ideas to partially privatize Social Security and to provide more incentives for people to own homes or start businesses.
The political question is this: Would bold new proposals create more excitement among voters, or would they mire the campaign in debate that could detract from the goal of promoting Mr. Bush?
It is also unclear whether voters have much appetite for another big idea from the president.
Since taking office, after all, Mr. Bush has pushed through two huge tax cuts, which contributed to record deficits; a war against Iraq, which is not going especially well; and a broad expansion of Medicare, which is proving more expensive and less popular than its supporters expected.

For all the allure of replacing a tax code that millions of people resent, even a general proposal would open up an arcane debate that would be full of potential minefields.

IT would be easier for Mr. Bush to come up with new incentives for increasing homeownership.
But those ideas could easily seem incremental, akin to Republicans' support for tax-free medical savings accounts.
Those expanded health savings accounts allow people to set aside tax-free money for medical expenses and health insurance.
They help soften the impact of rising insurance costs but are unlikely to bring crowds to their feet.

And homeownership has already climbed to record levels over the last four years, thanks mainly to the Federal Reserve Board's low interest rates.
Mr. Bush is correct in saying that the economy is strengthening, and growth this spring was at a respectable annual pace of 3 percent.
But job creation has to make up a lot of lost ground, and job growth all but stalled in June and July.
Soaring oil prices have pinched consumers, making people feel poorer and causing a slowdown in retail sales.
Economists are still betting that growth will gather speed again if oil prices recede from their current level of around $45 a barrel.
But the pause makes it harder for Mr. Bush to ride along the economic trend.

Fundamental tax reform is a big idea with potentially broad appeal: millions of people view the existing tax code as unwieldy and inequitable.

Campaign officials say Mr. Bush has always favored ideas to make the tax code simpler and fairer, and he has already pushed for a multitude of changes aimed at shielding investment income from taxes.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Supporters of broader change include John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary; Joshua B. Bolten, the budget director; and R.Glenn Hubbard, a former White House economic adviser who regularly consults with the Bush campaign.
Many of Mr. Bush's advisers strongly favor a consumption-based tax, an idea that has been kicked around for years.
Such a system would probably entail creating new savings accounts, bigger versions of the ''lifetime savings accounts'' that Mr. Bush has already proposed.
The accounts would let people set aside thousands of dollars a year, earn investment income tax-free and use that money at any time and for any purpose.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A consumption-based tax system would also include lower taxes on business, which is another way of eliminating taxes on investment.
Businesses would be allowed to write off much or all of their investments in new equipment immediately.
Supporters say that such a tax code would be simpler and fairer than today's system, and that it would provide powerful new incentives for people to save money.
And they say it could still have progressive tax rates, so that higher-income people would pay a higher percentage of income taxes.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Critics contend that a consumption tax would be tilted in favor of the rich, because wealthy people tend to earn a bigger share of their income from investments and can afford to save and invest more of their earnings each year.
Within the Bush campaign, the debate centers on tactics: would Mr. Bush simply invite more trouble by offering up unfamiliar ideas that his opponents could attack as giveaways to the rich?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The administration already has a likely vehicle for a new effort: a repair of the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax that was created to stop wealthy people from taking unfair advantage of arcane tax breaks.
But because the tax is not adjusted to account for inflation and rising incomes, it is expected to apply to millions of middle-income families over the next several years, forcing them to pay higher taxes.
Democrats and Republicans agree they want to prevent that from occurring, but the cost could exceed $500 billion over 10 years.
The Treasury Department is under White House orders to propose a long-term fix, and many officials see it as a perfect opportunity to rethink the broader tax code.

Otherwise, a new governor cannot be chosen until November 2005, and Senate President Richard J. Codey, a Democrat, would serve out the rest of the term, until January 2006.

Two lawyers filed a class action in Trenton on Monday to compel the state to order an election for governor on the Nov. 2 ballot.

After adjusting for inflation, weekly wages are lower than they were a year ago.

Nevertheless prices climbed much more slowly in July, and not only because of a drop in gasoline prices.

Oil prices are the biggest wild card, affecting both consumer prices and inflation.
Most analysts think that rising oil prices played a significant role in slowing consumer spending and overall economic growth.
That poses a difficult challenge for Mr. Greenspan and the Fed.
To the extent that high oil prices threaten economic growth and employment, the Fed might be tempted to offset the effect by keeping interest rates low.
But interest rates are already so far below normal that Fed officials would risk fueling inflation on top of the effects of high oil prices.
''Higher oil prices make the Fed's job more difficult by both raising inflation and depressing output,'' wrote Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs, in a research note on Tuesday.
''In most circumstances, an oil price shock should result in higher, not lower, interest rates.''

In contrast, Asian and European diplomats and businessmen who have long dealt with North Korean officials describe an eagerness to adopt new ideas and policies, leading some to make comparisons to two formerly reclusive Communist Asian nations, China and Vietnam.
Proponents of a hard line against North Korea say it is not really interested in change, but in simply avoiding economic collapse and driving a wedge between the United States and its allies.
Whatever the North's motives, those favoring engagement argue, the North Korea of today is less isolated and more economically stable than it was just two years ago.
North Korea began opening up immediately after its first summit meeting with South Korea in 2000.
Since then, it has established diplomatic ties with 19 new countries, including Britain, Australia and nations of the European Union.

North Korea is said to have German speakers because of its ties with the former East Germany.

''We can call this a breakthrough,'' said Uwe Schmelter, who is the director of Seoul's Goethe Institute and negotiated the Pyongyang center's opening with North Korean officials.
''For a country that has been labeled as isolated, reclusive and unchanging, a change is a change.''
In September, Germany is expected to begin offering 10-day classes on modern research techniques, including use of the Internet.
Perhaps even more notable are the effects of the economic reforms that North Korea announced two years ago, including floating exchange rates and prices, and granting more autonomy to enterprises and farms.
According to visitors to North Korea, once bare store shelves are now stocked with all sorts of consumer goods, many from China.
About 300 markets selling food, clothing and other goods have been established.
The number of cars in Pyongyang is said to be increasing, including that of the Whistle, a car that the South Korean Pyeonghwa Motors began assembling with parts from Fiat in Pyongyang in 2002.

Hyundai Asan, the South Korean company that already operates a tourist resort in southeastern North Korea, will open the first phase of a $180 million industrial park in Kaesong in southwestern North Korea.
Parts of a new highway and railroad to Kaesong, cutting through the once impenetrable demilitarized zone separating the South and the North, have already been built.

In May, Mr. Shim and seven other Hyundai officials took eight high-ranking North Korean officials on a 10-day tour of Chinese special economic zones in Shanghai and Shenzen.
Hyundai had been urging them to visit the sites for three years.
We need more time.
''I had never heard them make that kind of comment before.''
At the same time, the governments of America's two closest Asian allies, South Korea and Japan, have been aggressively engaging in bilateral talks with North Korea.
After paying his second visit to North Korea in May, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan said his country might normalize relations with the North within a year.

As for South Korea, it recently began holding high-level talks with North Korea on the most difficult of areas: the military.
''The scope and frequency of our talks have been increasing,'' said Kim Yeon Chul, policy adviser to the minister at the Ministry of Unification.

As an indication of the different approach taken by the United States, South Korean officials have chafed at a human rights bill passed last month by the House of Representatives.
Called the North Korean Human Rights Act, it seeks to support North Korean refugees in China and promote human rights in China.
''We hope the bill won't have any bad effect on the Korean peninsula,'' Mr. Kim said.
A Western diplomat here cautioned against attaching too much importance to European and Asian nations' engagement of North Korea, saying that they tended to make few difficult demands of the North Koreans.
Oil prices started rising substantially in May, driven by growing world demand, as well as by concerns over possible disruption of supplies from an unstable Iraq and other major producers like Russia and Venezuela.
Undoubtedly, the recent price surge will hurt.
Rising gasoline prices have weighed down consumer spending, the driver of economic growth over the last three years.
More costly oil has also proved to be a drag on the more energy-intensive Asian economies -- like China's -- cutting into American exports.

Energy prices have added roughly one percentage point to inflation over the last year, shaving consumers' purchasing power proportionately.
This contributed to a cooling economy in the second quarter, when the growth of consumer spending slowed to 1 percent at an annual rate, from 4.1 percent in the preceding three months.
''I don't think it's a coincidence.''

Yet the economy is showing some resilience.
The consumers who winced in June as the price of gas soared at the pump, proved in July to have staying power.
Retail sales -- excluding autos, gasoline and restaurants -- bounced from a flat result in June to a 0.8 percent monthly increase in July, according to the National Retail Association.
And the association is reporting strong back-to-school sales.
Most economists have only shaved their growth forecasts.

Mr. Harris also reduced his forecast -- cutting an average of 0.3 percentage point from G.D.P.
growth over the next six quarters.
''Oil is maybe half of the story,'' Mr. Harris said.
There are several reasons to worry less about oil prices than during past oil shocks.
The economy is much less dependent on oil than it was then.
Today, it takes about 20 percent less energy to create a dollar of gross domestic product than it did during the last oil spike, during the first gulf war in 1991.

Oil prices will slow the economy mainly through the price of gasoline, dipping into consumers' pocketbooks and billfolds -- and pushing up the cost to transport goods.
Yet after spiking in May, gasoline prices have actually slipped, as refiners have increased production and rebuilt inventories.

''Even at $48 per barrel we think it unlikely that retail gasoline prices will exceed their May peak of 206.4 cents by more than 10 cents,'' wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to investors.
But perhaps the most important difference compared with the oil spikes of the past is the behavior of inflation and interest rates.
Traditionally, higher oil has put the Federal Reserve in a tight spot -- depressing economic activity while at the same time sharply stoking inflation, creating pressure for a rise in interest rates.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Yet this time prices are not soaring.
This has allowed long-term interest rates to decline, as investors have concluded that higher energy costs are likely to slow the Fed's hand in raising short-term rates; not speed it.
Low interest rates, in turn, have provided an unexpected stimulus to household borrowing -- the main economic fuel of the last three years -- and given a big boost to construction and housing.
Housing starts surged 8.3 percent in July.
Rising oil prices might yet cause economic havoc.
If oil keeps rising at the current pace, heating oil prices could surge this winter, driving up costs for homeowners and landlords alike, and ultimately for many renters.
Thus, if high energy prices persist, they might alter consumer spending habits.
Persistently high oil prices would also be likely to push up the cost of other energy sources, like natural gas -- an important fuel for manufacturers and utilities.
It would further squeeze corporate profits.
But so far, the damage seems less than catastrophic.

''The price is high enough now that it can reduce the growth rate of the economy,'' said James Hamilton, an economist and expert on oil shocks at the University of California, San Diego.
''But I'm not predicting a recession.''

While Hawaii home prices have climbed steadily in recent years, the trend has been most pronounced on Maui, the second-largest island, blessed with some of the most coveted beaches in the world as well as a wide variety of other attractions.
From the posh shorefront resorts, to the rainy bamboo forests of Hana, to the 10,000-foot Haleakala Crater, the Valley Isle, as the island is also known, is a vaunted destination for golfers and retirees as well as naturalists and adventurers.
Capitalizing on the exposure from tourism, Maui's real estate market seems finally to be catching up to its priceless beauty, spurred on by many of the same factors that have pushed some mainland housing prices to record levels: low interest rates, the retirement of wealthy baby boomers and a limited supply of property, according to Paul H. Brewbaker, chief economist for Bank of Hawaii.
Bob Cella is another beneficiary of Maui's boom.
The company's 11 agents sold about $50 million worth of property in 1996.
''For the buyer who wants this type of product, they have plenty of money.
They buy one of these condos for a couple million dollars and obviously the product is not worth that, but the lifestyle certainly is.''

Across the island -- whether it's the bucolic ''up-country'' communities like Kula and Makawao or the golf resorts at Kapalua, Kaanipali and Wailea -- nearly everyone who bought property in the last six years has doubled his money, or better.

Sitting in their sun-drenched oceanfront living room, Jeff and June Mair can attest to that.
The California retirees came to Maui in 2001, and their 4,800-square-foot custom home -- which cost $2.95 million for land and construction -- is now worth more than $7 million.
The rising property values have also brought along some undesired side effects.
A shortage of affordable housing is one of Maui County's chief concerns, and residents worry about sustaining the environment, culture and lifestyle.
''Wherever it's beautiful and wonderful, it's changing so much that your head spins,'' said Hunton Conrad, a Hawaiian-born architectural designer who has worked on Maui for the past 26 years.
''In places near the ocean, most of the architecture now reflects a Newport Beach mentality.''

One of the most striking reflections of the market's hasty leap can be found a short stroll from Doug and Mary Hajjar's place along Keawakapu Beach, where several $10-million-plus mansions have crowded out the understated cottages and ranch-style homes that once lined the shore.
Towering over a westward ocean view, a 27,800-square-foot orange stucco mansion -- designed by the Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta -- is a boxy beacon of contemporary luxury.
Mrs. Tavares and her husband, Howard, 71, say they are the only original landowners along the South Kihei Beach, which, like much of Maui, has become too expensive for locals to afford.
But as clear as the flat orange lines of the Legorreta house against the blue ocean is the allure of buying one's own piece of paradise, something the latest crop of Maui homeowners have shown a willingness to pay for.
''It's your own private magical space, which is hard to find anywhere,'' Mr. Hajjar said.
''I've traveled all over the world and I've never found a space that makes you feel like that.''

As the American military worries about how to control Mr. Sadr -- whose impassioned calls to fight Americans have found fertile ground among this country's impoverished Shiites -- civilian casualties are another concern.
Mr. Sadr's followers are fighting from rooftops and grammar schools, drawing American troops into battles that create great danger for civilians.

Hussein Hadi, deputy director of Najaf's main Al Hakim Hospital, says that the recent fighting has been even worse for civilians than the last time Mr. Sadr and his militia rebelled.
In the last three weeks, the daily death toll has been about the same, but it includes more women and children than before.
''This time, it's the average people that are dying,'' Mr. Hadi said.
''Now the Americans are using heavier weapons.
We see many children with more severe injuries.''
In Judaada, many such casualties have occurred.
His father, a truck driver away on a run, does not know what happened.

''He will carry the American occupation with him for the rest of his life,'' Mr. Hadi said.
Kaihla Fahem, 12, was sleeping when a mortar crashed into her home, causing a wall to collapse and gouging a large gash into her leg.
It is not clear who fired the shot.
Still, her mother, Um-Ali, 35, blames the American military.
''We're fed up with Americans,'' she said.
The American military often is a lightning rod for ordinary Iraqis' anger over the chaos that has befallen the country since the war.
In an insurgent war and the confusion over who fired first, Americans are often blamed.
Mr. Sadr, who is politically ambitious, has tapped into that anger, rallying thousands with calls of nationalism and religion.

Even so, in Judaada, people have little sympathy for Mr. Sadr.
Many residents follow a more moderate Shiite leader, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's highest Shiite leader.
He opposes Mr. Sadr's rebellion, which has been run from the holiest shrine for Shiites in Iraq.

There have been no double-blind controlled studies, the gold standard in scientific research, looking at the safety of soy in humans.
And the existing research has produced conflicting results, providing little guidance and creating a heated debate among experts.

''People feel very strongly about this issue because there are not many other dietary compounds which could potentially be beneficial in terms of preventing breast cancer and other diseases,'' said Dr. Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, an oncology professor at Georgetown University and a leading expert on nutrition and cancer.
''But they look at the results of studies from their point of view and ignore results that don't support their view.''
The question of soy's health benefits or risks has become more acute as consumption of soy and soy products increases, particularly among women seeking a substitute for hormone therapy.
Sales of soy foods soared in the late 1990's, and increased 44 percent since 2001, reaching $3.9 billion last year, according to Soyatech and Spins, two market research firms.
''Consumers have realized that they can get isoflavones from a glass of soy milk, there are more soy snacks available, and people don't have to take a supplement -- they can go out and eat it,'' Mr. Golbitz said.

In studies, soy supplements have been found to reduce the severity of hot flashes by only about 10 to 20 percent, after accounting for the placebo effect, a significant factor in treatments for menopause.
Women taking hormone therapy have found their hot flashes reduced by about 60 percent.
Still, both the American Menopause Foundation, an education and advocacy group, and the North American Menopause Society, a medical group, support the use of a moderate-dose soy supplement for menopause if other lifestyle factors are ineffective.
The most important issue is what connection, if any, there is between breast cancer and the estrogen in soy.
The big worry is that by consuming large amounts of soy, women who are at high risk for breast cancer, who have an undetected breast cancer or who are survivors at risk for recurrence are exposing themselves to estrogen that might promote certain breast cancers.
A related concern is that soy supplements may somehow interfere with tamoxifen, an antiestrogen drug taken by women to help prevent breast cancer.

But the effect of the estrogen in soy on breast cells is poorly understood.
Some studies, for example, those of Dr. Bill Helferich, a nutrition professor at the University of Illinois, suggest that the estrogen can cause breast cell proliferation, and potentially tumor growth.
Without the body's estrogen competing for receptor sites on breast cells, the estrogen in the isoflavones, called genistein, locked on, and made the tumors grow.

Other studies suggest that the estrogen in soy is weak, and so can prevent tumor growth, working, in fact, the way tamoxifen does.
In this model, genistein competed with the body's estrogen for the receptor sites, and in the end, less estrogen attached to breast cells, and the tumors did not grow.
Meanwhile, no study in women has shown an increased risk of breast cancer among those taking soy.

Epidemiological studies from Japan have found that women who eat soy throughout their lives have slightly lower rates of breast cancer than those who do not, and that Japanese breast cancer patients have a higher survival rate than Westerners.
But many of these studies were designed to look at other questions, not the relationship between soy and breast cancer, and experts point out that other diet, lifestyle and genetic factors may be at play in the lower cancer rate.
In their view, these studies do not provide evidence that eating soy helps prevent cancer.
Because of this, a popular theory is that early exposure to soy may be what protects women from breast cancer.

Indeed, studies have shown that as the breast develops, soy spurs its cells to mature and become differentiated; the more differentiated they are, the less they proliferate, and the less vulnerable they are to cancer.

Dr. Mindy S. Kurzer, a nutrition professor at the University of Minnesota, said that to have a preventive effect, ''soy needs to be consumed during the time that the breast is developing, pre-pubertal.''
The one point experts agree on is that it is probably safe to eat soy foods in moderation, as people in Asian countries have done for centuries.

''Soy foods are great; they appear to be absolutely safe when consumed at levels consumed in Asia, which is one to two servings a day,'' Dr. Kurzer said.
On average, Asians consume about 15 to 30 milligrams of isoflavones a day, Dr. Helferich said.

But in the United States, a woman could potentially consume 75 to 80 milligrams a day, through products like soy energy bars, chips and enriched cereal, as well as soy milk and tofu.
In addition, the concentration of isoflavones in some supplements has increased.
Some have as much as 300 milligrams, although most have about 45.
Some supplement companies have also added isoflavones to other nutrients directed at menopausal women, among them calcium or herbs like black cohosh, which also contain phytoestrogens.
''We have very little data on supplements, and until we get more data, I wouldn't recommend them,'' Dr. Kurzer said.
Many experts believe eating soy in moderation is safe for women who have had breast cancer.
As for soy foods, ''I fall on the side of the debate that soy foods have been eaten for centuries and it's hard to overconsume them,'' said Diana Dyer, a cancer survivor and author of ''A Dietitian's Cancer Story.''
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But Dr. Kurzer qualified this.
''My recommendation to a woman who has breast cancer is that if she has been consuming soy as part of her diet for a long time at a level of one to two servings a day or less, she can continue that,'' she said.
''But I would not recommend that women who haven't been eating soy start.''
''There's a lot of politics in the price, a lot of expectations of the worst,'' said Mehdi Varzi, senior energy consultant at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London.

''The Fed has some scope to respond to the weakening of the economy associated with an oil price increase, so long as we are confident that inflation will remain stable,'' Mr. Bernanke said in an interview on the Public Broadcasting Service.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Though Friday's peak price was the highest since the Nymex opened in 1983, oil prices are not extraordinarily high by historic standards.
When inflation is taken into account, crude oil would have to rise to about $80 a barrel to match the levels of March 1981.
Though the unreliability of supply from Iraq has helped push prices up, strong demand has been the main factor in the broader rise in energy prices this year.
The International Energy Agency, an adviser to 26 industrialized nations, estimates that global oil demand will reach 82.2 million barrels a day this year, an increase of 3.2 percent, and will rise another 1.8 million barrels a day, or 2.2 percent, in 2005.
The boom in China is a primary reason; net Chinese imports of crude oil and refined products like gasoline and jet fuel have doubled in less than two years, the energy agency said.
''The confluence of real and suspected political risk has added a premium on oil prices, while demand from China has surprised everyone,'' said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a New York consulting firm.

There is not much that even the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can do to moderate prices, analysts say.
Members of the cartel, which produces a third of the world's crude oil supply, are pumping about 30 million barrels of oil a day, and only one member -- Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the group -- is thought to have any ability to increase output further.

The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, has said that the country has added one million barrels a day to output in recent months and could pump 1.5 million more a day if needed.
But the market has taken little notice of the offer so far, partly because most of the new oil the Saudis could deliver quickly would be undesirably heavy and high in sulfur, and thus difficult to refine.
There is no consensus on where prices may be headed.
''The market is concerned about the long-term reliability of supply from Middle Eastern countries,'' Mr. Varzi of Dresdner said.
''The problem is that, fundamentally, $45 a barrel is way beyond what the market can sustain.
What goes up must go down.''

''This is the playing field, and we're just playing on it,'' said Don R. Bouc, the president of Nelnet, one of the nation's largest student loan companies.
According to federal records, provided by members of Congress, Nelnet's quarterly payments from the government at the old subsidy rate have gone from about $4.6 million at the end of 2002 to $48.7 million in June.

''Yeah, it's a great return,'' Mr. Bouc said of the subsidy.
''But there are better ways of using the money.''
Virtually all parties in the debate, be they Republican or Democrat, say the loopholes should be closed so that the money can benefit students, not bottom lines, but few can agree on whose responsibility it is.
Democrats accuse the Bush administration of tacitly supporting the loopholes by paying the swelling invoices some lenders send them.
The Education Department blames the Clinton administration for setting an early precedent that it is merely following today.
Congress has a number of proposals before it from each side of the aisle, but has made little headway on the issue -- or on most of the other major higher education questions before it -- for the better part of a year.

In the meantime, student loan companies like Nelnet are building up huge loan portfolios that carry the old subsidy rate, and may continue to carry them even if the law is changed.
Nelnet alone accounts for more than $3 billion of the increase.

Government payments to student loan companies are not unusual.
In fact, they are a cornerstone of the federal financial aid system, enabling companies to offer students unusually low interest rates while still making their profit margins.

Congress eliminated the guarantee by 1993, eventually moving to a system that is more closely tied to the market, but it allowed some lenders to keep collecting the higher interest rates on money they had already raised.
What Congress did not anticipate was that interest rates would fall so low, making the promise of a 9.5 percent return a potential windfall in a market where students are paying less than 3.4 percent in interest on their loans.
Moreover, some of the lenders who originally qualified for the guarantee have been converted into, or have been subsumed by, for-profit companies, putting greater emphasis on the search for profits.
In recent years, lenders have begun employing some creative financing tactics to keep the old guarantees alive on entirely new loans, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office.
It found that the guarantees have given lenders at least $1.7 billion more in federal subsidies than they might have received otherwise, and most of that has come in the last few years.
More than three dozen lenders, most of them nonprofits, received the higher interest rates last year, the accounting office found, and almost half of them have managed to expand their loan portfolio in recent years, assuring them bigger subsidies.

''Everyone's rushing in before the door closes,'' said Matthew J. Snowling, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.

Democrats in Congress contend that the Education Department has stood back and let loan companies exploit loopholes giving them access to old subsidies, in part because of the Bush administration's political connections with lenders.
Indeed, Mr. Bouc of Nelnet was appointed by the department to serve on a financial aid advisory committee, but the department points out that it is not in favor of these higher subsidies, and has proposed changes that would save billions in its budget for the next fiscal year.
As for closing the loopholes now, while lenders are hurriedly mounting large portfolios, the department said there was little it could do.
''I don't think we would want them to do it,'' Sally Stroup, an assistant secretary of education, said of the rapid increase in new loans with the old guarantees.
''But I don't think we have the legal authority to stop them.''

Many experts, including some within the department itself, disagree.
''It is the agency's responsibility to fix them.
It is irresponsible not to act.''
The department says it is anxious for Congress to rewrite the law, soon.
Members of Congress are confident a change will come, eventually, but so far the issue has been just one of many tied up in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which expired last year.
The process has been highly partisan, inflamed by intense lobbying from loan companies and educators alike, and is nowhere near completion.
Beyond that, Republicans and Democrats differ on how tightly the loopholes should be closed.
While Republicans in the House have proposed cutting off the guarantee on loans made after May 2004, Senate Democrats say the government should refuse paying the high subsidies to any company that has used the loopholes to build large loan portfolios over the last few years, and possibly even before that.

Though rising interest rates will probably decrease the size of the subsidies lenders receive, the delay could still be costly because student loan companies can keep issuing new loans with the old guarantee until the rules are changed, experts say.
In its report, for instance, the institute for college access estimates that waiting another year to close the loopholes could cost an extra $2.8 billion in federal subsidies that do not expand college access but siphon away money that could possibly be used for college grants instead.
Ms. Steenhoek has refinanced her home mortgage loan, and remembers getting ''about $400 a kid'' in the Bush tax cut, but she said it still feels like the family budget is shrinking.
And she has not even thought of taking a few days off.

''A vacation?
No, I can't leave the office.''
For Ms. Steenhoek, the economy is the No.
1 issue in the presidential campaign.
She is that rare species this election year: the undecided voter.
But even solid partisans are troubled by the tremors at the edge of middle-class life.
''I'm a pretty staunch Bush Republican and I have a great job at I.B.M.,'' said Todd Canny, who was sharing ice cream with his three children and wife in a new mall.
''But we're paying a lot more for health care co-pays and premiums, which is through my wife's job as a teacher.
And trying to save for college for these three little ones has gotten a lot harder.''
Senator John Kerry says the middle class has shrunk since President Bush took office, and when judged by the percentage of Americans who made $25,000 to $75,000 in 2003 -- 45 percent of households -- he is right, according to factcheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center that monitors campaign claims.
Mr. Bush cites record home ownership and a rising investor class.
He points to indicators of coming economic growth, and says his tax policies have put money directly back in people's pockets.

But despite low inflation, record home ownership and productivity, many middle-class households are close to a tipping point -- a bill or two away from losing economic control, surveys and interviews show.
Even with the creation of a million new jobs over the last year, the percentage of people who say the economy is in good shape has fallen as Election Day approaches.

Last year, 1.6 million American households filed for personal bankruptcy, up 33 percent from 2000, according to figures kept by federal bankruptcy courts.
And if current trends hold, nearly one in seven families with children will declare bankruptcy by the end of the decade, said Dr. Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor who is the co-author of ''The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke'' (Basic).
''These people aren't poor,'' Ms. Warren said.
''But this is the first generation where college-educated people with a good job cannot find financial security.''

But Ms. Warren said the squeeze goes beyond short-term economic swings, and is worse than it has been at any time since the creation of the post-World War II middle class.
The reason is that the price of things that people cannot control, but need to get ahead of or stay ahead of, are rising much faster than inflation or wage increases.

With wages flat, college tuition is up an average of $1,207 for four-year institutions since 2000, and yearly health care premiums up $2,360 over the same period.
Mr. Bush's advisers say the tax cuts have made up for stagnant wages.
Real disposable income, money left over after taxes, is up slightly this year over last, and that is mostly because of tax cuts.

Another variable is gas prices.
They have fallen some from recent highs, but record oil prices portend a winter when home heating fuel costs could break some family budgets.
Already, higher gas prices have cost the average family about $500 a year.
So even though people received additional money out of their houses, through low-interest rate refinancing, or in their pockets, through the federal tax cuts, the stimuli seem to have worn off.
Nearly two-thirds of people in recent polls say they have trouble paying bills and feel pinched by the rising costs of middle-class essentials.

It is one thing to feel the squeeze in Newton, a Maytag company town east of Des Moines where layoffs and outsourcing have had a ripple effect on businesses big and small.
But it is quite another to hear people talk about the squeeze inside the polished marble shopping palace of the new Jordan Creek Town Center, Iowa's biggest mall.
The Cannys live near the mall, in the fastest growing part of Iowa, where big houses and new office parks have sprouted in former corn fields.

Mr.
Canny said the Bush tax cut did not help his personal finances as much as the rising health care costs and the higher price tag for filling his S.U.V.
Mr.
Canny has yet to give Senator Kerry, who used the term ''middle class'' eight times in his Democratic Party acceptance speech, a second look.
''But if things continue to get worse, it may start to affect my vote,'' Mr.
Iowa's seven electoral votes went to former Vice President Al Gore by a slim margin in 2000 and the state is up for grabs this year, according to polls.
It is not only a swing state, but also emblematic of all the trends that have pressed middle-class Americans.

Ms. DeBruyn and Ms. Steenhoek, here in Newton, own their businesses.
Both women have a spouse who also works.
But both women feel they have lost ground because of costs they cannot control, costs of things that keep them among the overwhelming majority of Americans who say they are middle class.

When Mr. Kerry said in his acceptance speech that ''People are working weekends, two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead,'' it went directly to the middle-class squeeze issue, and hit its mark in some households in Iowa.
''I like some of what Kerry has to say on the economy,'' Ms. Steenhoek said.
But both women also like President Bush's emphasis on trying to give tax money back to middle-class families.
In Iowa a few months ago, Mr. Bush said the election ''is a choice between keeping the tax relief that is working, or putting the burden of higher taxes back on the working people.''
Here in the troubled prairie town of Newton, the only way Ms. DeBruyn says she can keep her dream of owning a small business alive is by firing her daughter, whom she has been paying $6.50 an hour.
Then she plans to move the business into her home and open it at night, while holding onto her full-time day job as well.

''I'd like to retire in this town,'' said Ms. DeBruyn, who has lived in Newton all her life.

BERKOWITZ--William.
Mr. Berkowitz, as President of one of the nation's first and largest retail Money Market Mutual Funds, Dreyfus Liquid Assets, helped to transform the way Americans save.
As he told ''Forbes'' in 1980, ''...the savings public is becoming more sophisticated.
It will not stand for this 5% rate on passbooks (savings accounts).''
He fought against the regulation of the money market industry and welcomed competition from banks by testifying in favor of lifting Regulation Q--which prevented banks from paying prevailing high interest rates on savings accounts.
Before receiving his Bachelor of Science in Finance from New York University in 1963, he attended Syracuse University and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan in 1959.
Survivors include his beloved wife of 41 years, Dale S.; a daughter and son in law, Dana B. and John Snyder of Columbia, MD; sons and daughters in law David L. and Patti C. of Middletown, NJ, Barry J. and Chrissy of Potomac, MD, and Jeffrey A. and Susan of Sarasota; a sister Harriet Fortgang of Atlanta; and six grandchildren, Matthew, Dylan, Daniel, Bryce, Anna and Alexandra.

Tour officials see the benefit of nationalistic rivalries and a pipeline of Russians flowing with the oil of long-term success.

Just how many Russian girls and women are now playing is a question that even the country's tennis federation cannot answer.
Russian players and coaches dismiss that estimate as wildly inflated, saying a more accurate estimate would be 3,000 to 5,000.

''Maybe that is everybody's nightmare because there are so many on Tour,'' Olga Morozova, who in 1974 became the first Russian woman to reach a Grand Slam final, said with a laugh.
If mass success is a recent phenomenon in Russia, tennis is not.
Her appearance resulted from an earlier trip that the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made to London, according to a story that may or may not be true but is told with great relish by Morozova, a former coach of the Russian national team.

''She wants to be an individual,'' Max Eisenbud, Sharapova's agent, said.
''Why talk about Dementieva and Myskina?''
Despite the ego jockeying, Russian tennis players have sprung from a system of coaching and development in place at the end of the Soviet Union.
Most of today's top players began their careers at sporting clubs in Moscow like Dynamo, CSKA and Spartak.
Modern tennis clubs are being built in Moscow: Valery, founded in 1998 as a children's academy, advertises 14 indoor courts and 14 outdoor courts.
The Russian federation holds hundreds of youth tournaments yearly.
Many professionals, though, leave to train in the United States or Spain, given the disrepair of courts at home and a desire for better coaching.
Because it has no hardcourts, she must go elsewhere to train on that surface.
It is a hardy player who learns how to play on cracked, bumpy courts, said Elena Bovina, who is ranked 27th in the world.

''I've never seen such mania over one player in my 23 years in the sport,'' said Worcester, the Pilot Pen tournament director.
Sharapova, ranked seventh in the world, is being marketed as a worldly woman who loves to read and visit museums.
But she is also a typical 17-year-old who says things like, ''The only reason I'm an iPod fan is because it comes in pink.''
As all prodigies do, she is learning that early success brings a burden of expectation.
For now, as with other Russians, she appears voracious, fearless.

To the Editor:

Recent letters, editorials and the tenor of your Aug. 29 special section on the Republican convention suggest that the Republicans might have made a mistake in choosing New York for their convention.
As a lifelong Democrat, at first I, too, felt angry: the chutzpah in picking this city for showcasing ideas and policies abhorrent to most New Yorkers!
But on further reflection, I think that this was a good idea.
Obviously, some 50,000 visitors in Manhattan, when many people are away, are good for the economy.
But more important, these thousands will get to witness the new face of America, a face perhaps not so visible in the places they come from.
The delegates will be driven by Indian and Pakistani cabbies, fed by Korean and Middle Eastern shopkeepers and restaurateurs and will, in general, interact with many other New Yorkers from Africa, Russia and Latin America.
Maybe this experience will help them adjust their positions on immigration, health care and other social issues dividing the two parties.
Conversely, I wish that the Democrats had held their convention in Salt Lake City, not Boston.

The "Hero" story -- of a third century B.C.
assassin who comes within reach of China's legendary King of Qin but fails to kill him -- is well known to the Chinese.
In Mr. Zhang's telling, the assassin gives up the opportunity to kill the king for the good of the empire emerging under the king's rule.
The king orders the would-be assassin killed instead.
"There are elements that are purely Chinese, but I made an effort to keep a balance between the two."

Miramax was one of his biggest backers, covering nearly two-thirds of the film's $30 million cost.

Talk of the cuts and the delay in bringing the film to American theaters fed rumors that Miramax wasn't happy with the film.
(In Variety today, Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax, wrote a guest column recounting his firm's differences with the Chinese distributors of "Hero" and other obstacles to the "full Oscar push" he says he had planned for it.)
It then planned the release to follow Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill" series, running trailers for "Hero" on the DVD of "Kill Bill Vol.
1" and in theaters with "Kill Bill Vol.
2."
It also put a "Quentin Tarantino Presents" label on the film, hoping to draw interest from the director's followers.
The strategy apparently worked.
"Making that association was very useful for getting the film out to an American audience," Mr. Zhang said.

He expects the success of "Hero" to help his next picture, "House of Flying Daggers," another martial-arts saga that is scheduled to open in American theaters in December -- distributed, like "Crouching Tiger," by Sony Pictures Classics.
He is in Europe promoting the film, which is set in the waning days of the Tang Dynasty and follows the story of two star-crossed lovers fighting a shadowy revolutionary alliance.
"It should be at least as well received, and maybe will exceed 'Hero,' because it is a film about love, and American audiences may find it easier to understand," Mr. Zhang said.

Correction: September 8, 2004, Wednesday Because of an editing error, an article in The Arts on Thursday about the filmmaker Zhang Yimou misidentified the place where he makes his movies.
It is mainland China, not Hong Kong.
Even so, the Dutch study has important implications for human and animal health, said Juan Lubroth, a senior animal health officer at another United Nations agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization.
An estimated 200 million birds have either died of A(H5N1) or been slaughtered to control the outbreak since last winter, when the strain simultaneously appeared in eight Asian countries.
United Nations officials have described the scale of the epidemic -- geographically and economically -- as unprecedented for an avian flu outbreak.
The strain has also been particularly lethal for humans, killing 25 of the 35 people infected.
Many influenza experts and health officials fear a worst-case occurrence in which a person becomes infected with both an avian influenza virus and a human one.
Under such a circumstance, the viruses might swap genes, creating a new virus that could cause an epidemic all over the planet much like that of the so-called Spanish flu of 1918-19, which killed 675,000 people in the United States alone and more than 20 million around the world.

After learning about those infections, the Rotterdam team, led by Dr. Thijs Kuiken, conducted three laboratory experiments by using the A(H5N1) virus isolated from a Vietnamese patient who had died of it.

First, Dr. Kuiken's team introduced the Vietnamese virus into the airways of three European shorthair cats, the breed generally used in animal experiments.
All three became sick beginning the next day, and one died on the sixth day of illness.
(People are not vulnerable to infection by eating chicken that is cooked, but the person who cooks it may be at risk from handling it, health officials say.)
In the third experiment, the researchers put two healthy cats in the same cage two days after infecting a third cat.
Additional research is needed because of the small size and scope of the Dutch study, experts said.
But the Food and Agriculture Organization "is not set up to conduct this type of research," Dr. Lubroth said, adding that scientists at universities and other research institutes would have to do much of it, though with technical advice from his agency.

One avenue of research will be to test whether cats that are susceptible to other strains of influenza virus can spread those strains as well.
In addition, Dr. Kuiken said his team planned to test whether the original A(H5N1) virus, from the 1997 Hong Kong case, could infect cats, or whether only the later, mutated form could do so.
At the same time, Dr. Lubroth said, agricultural workers need to educate farmers about good practices like not raising swine with chickens.

Another reform will be teaching farmers to keep cats away from poultry, although that step, Dr. Lubroth said, "may be as difficult as herding wild cats."

No less striking is how Mr. Gonzalez Gallego ended up there.
Exasperated with Aurora, the grandfather distanced himself from the family, Mr. Gonzalez Gallego says.
If his grandfather refused to reconsider his denunciation of the invasion, Moscow would reveal his lack of family feeling to a Spanish public whose good will he desperately wished to cultivate.
The Soviets obliged by burying the evidence of Gallego's indifference to his needy grandson.
"It's as it should be," he writes in mock echo of the attendants who viewed him as a drain on precious resources.
"I am not a human being.

"But I'm going to write about other things," Mr. Gonzalez Gallego announces early in the novel.

"I was supposed to be dying.
I was lying in a hospital bed when the ceiling started crawling with letters.

In a gesture of Communist solidarity, his grandfather had sent Aurora to a Polish home, "so we spoke like two soldiers from different countries," Mr. Gonzalez Gallego said, adding: "Different places but same language.
Mr. Gonzalez Gallego had less success publishing his book.
"'There has to be a plot, a beginning, an end.
It's unclear when the child speaks, when the adult, what's autobiographical and what's fiction.'
But there's a reason for this!
In many ways, I remain a child.
I am not fully formed."

Though the novel consists of heavily autobiographical vignettes, Mr. Gonzalez Gallego stripped his narrative of geographical markers, details of his physical condition and, in an ingenious replication of his own rootlessness, much of the context of orphanage life.
The resulting narrative feels at once concentrated and universalized beyond specific individuals or nations.
"I hate the word autobiographical," Mr. Gonzalez Gallego said.
It's a tale of survival, a genre going back to Jack London."
Since winning the Russian Booker Prize, which began under the auspices of the British prize and is now independently sponsored, "White on Black" has become a minor sensation, with 45,000 copies sold -- a considerable figure in Russia -- and editions published or pending in more than a dozen countries.
An English translation is making the rounds of United States publishers.
Still, Mr. Gonzalez Gallego's book hasn't stirred much of a debate in Russia about living with disability.
"This book is today's 'Gulag Archipelago,' a plea to ordinary people not to close themselves off to the truth and reality."

That means that each new dollar of economic output was accompanied by $3.19 in new debt.
So now, for the first time, the debt-to-G.D.P.
ratio stands at more than two to one.
Throw in financial credit -- the debt that investment banks and others use to finance trading activities and the like -- and total debt has more than doubled since 1994.
The mere existence of huge debt needn't be a source of panic.
You and I may view debt as an economic input -- we borrow so we can spend and invest, and hence, as politicians like to say, "grow the economy."
Academic economists view it more as a byproduct.
Debt is created when people, governments and companies spend money, trade and produce.
VIEWED that way, the sharp rise in credit in recent years isn't surprising or even, in and of itself, alarming.
"When interest rates are low, you'd expect people to pile on more debt per G.D.P.
because it's cheap," said J.Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.

But the economy's apparent reliance on credit to fuel everything from home buying to the military budget is troublesome.
If incomes and revenues fail to rise, stressed consumers may have a tough time keeping up with payments.

"You have to hope that people are going to be able to service the obligations they've taken on."

An economy hooked on debt also is vulnerable to the seemingly inevitable rise in interest rates.
And in a period when prudence would seem to dictate locking in rates, Americans have rushed to assume greater interest-rate risk.
Borrowers -- especially homebuyers -- haven't reacted to recent increases by borrowing less.

In the first quarter of 2004, debt rose at an annual clip of 8.6 percent, more than double the growth rate of the economy.
No, we've kept the interest bill down by swapping fixed-rate for adjustable-rate financing.
Consumers, whose maxed-out credit cards generally bear floating interest rates, and the federal government, which skews its borrowing to short-term instruments, have essentially done the same thing.
So if interest rates rise, we'll all have to spend more dollars on debt service, leaving fewer dollars for more productive uses -- like buying 90-inch flat-screen TV's.
If money becomes more expensive, we may have to downshift our spending and consumption, like drivers trading in expensive Hummers for gas-sipping imports.
And that may shrink the economy.
HIGHER collective leverage, in turn, means that we're more susceptible to external shocks.
Companies with no debt can weather several lean quarters; companies with piles of debt often find that a single bad quarter spells disaster.
The same holds for consumers.
All kinds of wild cards that are scary even in placid times -- another spike in gas prices, a rupture of the housing bubble, fresh job losses, a period of sustained inflation -- become nightmares during times of greater leverage.
So as we go to bed with our suppers and our home-equity lines of credit, Professor Goolsbee says: "I think we should be a little nervous."

Most economists agree that the slowdown can be substantially attributed to rising crude oil prices, sending gasoline prices sharply higher and taking a big bite out of consumers' wallets.
But other economists note that the lackluster growth in employment and wages could add to consumers' woes because it could deprive them of the spending power to keep the economic expansion on track.

The 313,000 jobs created in the last three months are hardly enough even to keep up with population growth, which on its own adds about 150,000 people to the labor supply each month.
Though wage growth picked up in July, salaries are still treading water.

Consumers have supported the economy almost single-handedly over the last two years, spending the proceeds from tax cuts and borrowing to refurbish their homes and to buy cars and other durable goods.
But the effect of the tax stimulus is waning.
As interest rates rise, the resulting costs are reining in mortgage refinancing and other household credit growth.
From now on, workers' spending will depend more on wage income.
Against this backdrop, it is perhaps unsurprising that consumers are not feeling great.
Last month, the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence -- which aims to measure the outlook on jobs and overall economic conditions -- fell for the first time since April.
According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, sales at stores of the nation's big retailers recorded the slowest growth since June 2003.

The campaign of John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, released a fact sheet pointing out that 1.6 million private-sector jobs have been lost since Mr. Bush took office.

"This is very bad news for Bush politically," said Jason Furman, an economic adviser for the Kerry campaign.
"It's difficult to make a lot of hay with this number."
Employment growth can be expected to have a substantial effect on the election.

In crucial swing states through the Rust Belt -- states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania that have suffered big job losses -- the issue is crucial.
Michigan, for instance, has had the steepest percentage drop in employment among all states over the last year.
Yet beyond the political reverberations, August's job growth was received in a relatively upbeat fashion, indicating that the standards for adequate employment levels have been downgraded.
An average of 140,000 jobs created each month over the last year is hardly good by historical measure.

"The reason we haven't had enough job growth is because there has not been enough growth in demand," Mr. Baily, the former Clinton adviser, said.

Yet others maintain that perhaps this is the kind of employment growth the economy is going to see for the foreseeable future.

News Analysis Correction: September 7, 2004, Tuesday A news analysis article in Business Day yesterday about the economy's lackluster rate of job creation misstated the pace of employment growth foreseen by the president's Council of Economic Advisers last December.
To realize the council's forecast of the total number of jobs held by Americans in 2004, the economy would have to create more than 300,000 jobs a month this year, not 216,000.
By now anyone of a certain age (that would be middle age) has come to the realization that the funky and lush bohemian New York that gave rise to The SoHo Weekly News, the alternative paper that was Paper's forerunner, has gone the way of cheap rents and Danceteria.
Yes, creative stuff still manages to get done here despite an urban landscape grown as homogeneous in its boring chic as the Friday night look-alikes in the meatpacking district.
Yes, bands like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs still find a way to get heard, too, although, let's face it, Blondie they are not.

And, yes, offbeat little fashion careers are also still possible here, with the emphasis on little.
But even designers resigned to their own insider status have trouble hanging on these days.
A couple of seasons ago, the designer Maria Cornejo became an unexpected and impressive addition to a Fashion Week calendar dominated by luxury brand behemoths and glorified stylists whose designs amount to little more, as the columnist Josh Patner once put it in Slate, "than a front and a back and maybe a zipper on the side seam, if they're feeling creative."
Economics are only part of the problem, however.
It is not just big money but the insidiousness of good taste that has conspired to sap New York of creative juice, according to Ms. Hastreiter, who, along with her coeditor David Hershkovits, has presided over Paper through the Pyramid Club years, the hip-hop era, logomania, the invasion of the Atlanta drag queens and the ongoing crypt-movie serial that is vintage.
Uptown and downtown do not get together much lately, except perhaps during Craigslist hookups.
And boring hip tastefulness has become a kind of wallpaper, or even Wallpaper, one might say.

"I was in Chicago recently and there are Eames chairs in the airport!"
"You can get espresso everywhere.
There's just too much good taste in the world."
Yet Ms. Hastreiter would not have lasted two decades at the vanguard of trend-spotting without a dose of Tony Robbins-style optimism.
And she certainly has that.
"The new doesn't just happen, boom!"

She added, "Subcultures don't come around reliably every year, but they do come around."
"The next big thing will probably start up in a garage somewhere with people who are totally fed up with everything that's going on," Ms. Hastreiter said.
"It will come from people we've never heard of who, like, totally hate everything that went before."
And now we're in New York to ratify the nomination.

Ever since the county spun off the agency as a public corporation in 1999, it has steadily lost money.
The agency has been rocked by staff layoffs and power struggles culminating in the forced departure of its president earlier this year.

As the provider to the poor and uninsured, the system includes a 631-bed hospital in East Meadow, an 889-bed nursing home in Uniondale and several clinics.
It also provides health services to jail inmates.
The refinancing, which the agency's board approved at a special meeting Tuesday night, now goes to the County Legislature for a vote.
Both the Democratic presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, and the Republican minority leader, Peter J. Schmitt, have promised the support of their delegations.
Under the refinancing, the agency will pay a lower interest rate on its existing $259 million debt and receive another $15 million for capital spending.
The refinancing itself will cost $3 million to $4 million, the agency estimates.
But the process will free up more than $20 million in reserve funds and save about $20 million in lower interest over the next three years, agency officials said.

"This gives us the breathing room to meet our immediate obligations," said the agency's acting president, Daniel A. Kane.

As part of the plans, agency officials expect higher state reimbursements for expanded mental health and substance abuse programs, for additional nursing home beds for patients with H.I.V.
and for the combining of neighborhood clinics and the hospital's outpatient clinics into a single system.

Further savings and improved services are projected by reorganizing the agency's administration, getting labor union concessions, developing new business plans, reviewing the clinical and teaching programs and exploring affiliations with other health care systems.
The agency will sell the rights to as many as 300 unused nursing home beds and shift the remaining nursing home patients to unused floors at the hospital and to buildings that are proposed to be built near the hospital.
The agency would then sell the abandoned nursing home property.
One member, Bobby Kumar, criticized the lack of specifics about the refinancing, saying, "I'm not a rubber stamp."
He and other board members also questioned whether the latest agreement between county officials and board officers gives too much control to the county.

Mr. Suozzi said that he wants to get the county government out of managing the health care system, but first wants to make sure that the agency is functioning well.
Although some of the material in "Coast to Coast" will be familiar to readers of the author's earlier books (most notably "Flashback," her memoir about her father, and "You Can Go Home Again: An Intimate Journey"), Ms. Johnson does a nimble job of reanimating her memories, investing them with the same sort of bittersweet comedy that animated her first novel, "The World of Henry Orient" (1958).

In doing so, she has written a lovely, piercing book, a book that provides the reader with a twinkling portrait of Hollywood and New York in the 1940's and 50's, while at the same time creating a poignant picture of the fallout that divorce can have on a young, self-conscious child.
In both setting and tone, "Coast to Coast" recalls Leslie Epstein's 2003 book "San Remo Drive" (a novel, apparently based closely on Mr. Epstein's own Hollywood childhood).
And like Brooke Hayward's classic 1977 memoir "Haywire," it manages to conjure -- without a shred of sentimentality -- both the public glamour of old-time Hollywood and the private troubles of one family that lived there.

As seen through his daughter's adoring eyes, Nunnally Johnson emerges as a kind of Fitzgerald personage: a combination of Monroe Stahr from "The Last Tycoon" and Dick Diver in "Tender Is the Night," a man who could hold audiences rapt with his stories and his wit, a man who could turn a nightmare vacation trip into "a comic Dagwood-daughter-dog adventure."

As Ms. Johnson recalls: "I was ridiculously in love with my father.
Her apartment boasted "peacock walls, cream satin curtains spilling from ceiling to floor, a white marble fireplace like a frozen meringue," and her day-to-day attire -- "satin skirt, a cinched waist, a low-cut velvet top" -- tended to be similarly lavish.

In Westwood, the U.C.L.A.
college town not far from Bel Air, Brentwood and Beverly Hills, rents for one-bedroom apartments are now about $1,500 a month.
And while university administrators hope to guarantee campus housing for all undergraduates who want it, a plan to add thousands of rooms by the end of the decade could still leave about 23,000 students, graduate and undergraduate, looking for housing in Westwood and its pricey surroundings, according to Michael Foraker, director of housing at U.C.L.A.
These factors, combined with California's rapidly appreciating housing market, have led real estate-savvy students and their parents to change their perspective on student housing.
Instead of viewing it as a draining but necessary expense, they consider it a lucrative investment opportunity.
"It makes so much sense; you don't pay any rent and you make money on your investment -- you might be able to pay to put your kids through school," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, who has witnessed the same phenomenon in downtown Los Angeles near the University of Southern California.
Likewise, a few hundred miles north, around the University of California at Berkeley, where housing prices have also skyrocketed, many students are now living in what are essentially investment properties, according to William Ktsanes, director of research and analysis for RealFacts, an apartment market research firm.
"Families looking at paying $1,500 a month for their child's apartment start considering buying a home and feel like it's a secure investment partially because it is in a college town and there will always be students that need housing there," he said.

With today's low interest rates, the math works out well, provided that parents can afford the down payment on a condo, which for a one- or two-bedroom unit around U.C.L.A.
would cost $350,000 to $500,000.
Other considerations include homeowner's dues, property taxes and maintenance, but those expenses can be offset if the student is willing to live with a roommate or two.

Although Westwood real estate's recent appreciation of about 15 percent a year makes the decision to buy look particularly easy in retrospect, the market needs only moderate growth for the investment to pay off, according to Suzanne Frank, owner of Abbot Kinney Real Estate in Venice.

Parents "can go get a place and put in a down payment and put a few other kids in there and the other students' parents are paying their mortgage," said Ms. Frank, who has sold real estate on the west side of Los Angeles for 20 years.

Emi Yoshida, 22, who graduated from U.C.L.A.
"I was clearly comparing the numbers between paying rent versus ownership, with the potential for a selling price that would make it a smart move at the end of a couple of years," said Mr. Yoshida, a San Francisco architect.
"I just went through the math on my own, and given the trend of how real estate is going down there, it made sense to do this."
For Ms. Yoshida, who is planning to move to New York City and seek work in public health, the arrangement was not only a good investment -- her condo has appreciated more than 30 percent since 2002 -- but also her first experience as a homeowner, acting as the de facto landlord, often dealing with renters who were people she knew.
"There's a business relationship that develops that's different from a friendship," she said.

But the young homeowners are gaining a different type of education, according to Richard Pon, 24, who is working toward a doctorate in electrical engineering at U.C.L.A.

Mr. Pon is already beginning to understand the responsibilities, and rewards, of owning a home.

Of course, sitting state lawmakers have some of the best job protection in the country.
Thanks to carefully drawn districts that tend to favor one party strongly over another, the ease of raising money from lobbyists and special interests, and the power to send constituents taxpayer-financed mail praising their achievements, lawmakers are re-elected more than 98 percent of the time.
Although there are 212 seats in the Legislature, political analysts predict there will be only a few competitive races.

Assemblyman Hoyt, the incumbent being challenged by Mr. Golombek in Buffalo, is clearly feeling the heat.
"I'm in the midst of a very tough primary battle, and the message that is coming loud and clear from my district -- and I think this is consistent throughout upstate New York -- is that people want reform," Mr. Hoyt said.
"I'm knocking on doors and people are saying, 'We're fed up with three men in a room,"' he said.
"While I can make an argument about how I am an agent of reform, but working within the system I have to work with, people are fired up and angry."
The Erie County executive, Joel A. Giambra, a Republican, started a group called Renew New York that is mailing fliers opposing Mr. Hoyt, including one that shows nine unflattering pictures of Mr. Hoyt with the word "problem" running across his forehead.

"I decided that trying to use peaceful persuasion was not getting the job done, was not getting anybody's attention in Albany," Mr. Giambra said in an interview, saying that he expected the group to spend more than $50,000 in the race.
But his involvement is attracting criticism from Democrats.
"The Erie County Republicans are blatantly attempting to influence this primary to distract attention from the fact that although Governor Pataki has said President Bush's economic policies are working, the people of western New York know that's not true," said Charles Carrier, a spokesman for Mr. Silver, the Assembly speaker.

Mr. Golombek said he knew it would be hard for him in the Legislature if he campaigned by criticizing Mr. Silver, who hands out committee assignments and the stipends that go with them, and controls what laws are passed and what pork is doled out.

"They can throw a perk here and a perk there," he said, "but in the final analysis all of the districts in New York State are harmed because of the current system."
Nevertheless, the gathering evidence in support of low-glycemic index eating has lent new validity to a bit of age-old nutritional wisdom: a healthy diet includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains and nuts, and relatively few sugary foods and drinks and refined starches.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The glycemic index is a measurement of how quickly 50 grams of a given carbohydrate are digested.
White bread has a rather high index value of 70, for example.
Lima beans have a value of 32, and linguine pasta has a value of 50.
Data from large population-based studies have indicated that people who eat a lot of foods that are high on the glycemic index have a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease.
The diabetes risk apparently stems from the way that high-index foods raise blood sugar, prompting the pancreas to release insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down.
Repeatedly taxing the insulin system in this manner may lead to insulin resistance.
"If you're not challenging your pancreas too much, you're less likely to develop diabetes," explained Dr. David J. Jenkins of the University of Toronto, who invented the glycemic index in 1981.
"And if you've got diabetes, you might be able to handle your metabolism better with a low-glycemic index diet than with a high one."
High index carbohydrates are not detrimental to people who are lean and active, Dr. Liu said, because their bodies use the carbohydrates as ready forms of energy.

But in those who are not active, repeatedly elevated blood sugar and insulin levels can damage cells in a way that promotes heart disease.
Also, excess blood sugar can be converted into stored fat and fatty acids, which raise the risk of heart disease.

Evidence that high glycemic index foods may contribute to overeating and weight gain comes from small studies, including two at Children's Hospital in Boston.

A new study of laboratory rats, also at Children's Hospital, offers some explanation of how glycemic index levels might make a difference.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A high glycemic index diet appeared to damage insulin-producing cells of the rats' pancreases.
And even if more complete evidence comes in, it would be a mistake to focus a diet too narrowly on the glycemic index, she said.
Dr. Ludwig and Dr. Jenkins say that for the average person wishing to eat a lower index diet, it is best to ignore the index numbers and simply aim to eat less refined starches.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

"Think of eating the traditional foods that many of us are no longer eating, like barley stew or lentil soup," Dr. Jenkins said.
The glycemic index concept has been criticized because it does not account for the way people typically eat several different foods at each meal.
Fat or protein in a meal slow digestion, decreasing any carbohydrate's effect on blood sugar.

"The more calories, the higher the glycemic response," said Dr. Arne Astrup, head of the Institute of Human Nutrition at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Frederiksberg, Denmark.
"I think this is telling us that we are trying to make this thing too simplistic."
Certainly, the largest for-profit hospital chains, like HCA and Tenet Healthcare, seem in no hurry to add to their empires.
HCA has fewer hospitals than it once did, having spun off LifePoint, for example.
It now operates 190 hospitals, compared with more than 350 it had at its peak, and has not been an aggressive acquirer lately.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

And Tenet, struggling to turn itself around financially, is actively shedding many hospitals.
But analysts say that, for many other hospitals and hospital chains, the current environment makes mergers more likely.
The need to invest significant sums in new technology or replacing aging buildings and equipment is likely to force those hospitals without ready access to capital into the arms of hospitals that are financially stronger.
"I think there will be more pressure to consolidate," said Martin D. Arrick, a managing director at Standard & Poor's, who analyzes the bonds of nonprofit hospitals.
Operating performance among these hospitals is likely to have peaked, he says, and some hospitals are likely to have difficulty raising the money they need to remain competitive.

"The hospital industry is at a watershed period," agreed Randy Fuller, the hospital segment manager for GE Healthcare Financial Services, which advises hospitals.
He also sees a growing divide between hospitals with ready access to capital and those whose tenuous finances make it difficult to find willing investors.

Among for-profit hospitals, the need to generate higher revenues and earnings at a time of scant growth in patient admissions is likely to persuade some chains to buy more hospitals, said Gary Taylor, an equity analyst who follows the industry for Banc of America Securities.
While Mr. Taylor says he does not think such deals necessarily benefit the companies involved, he says hospital executives will likely pursue them as a way of generating the kind of earnings growth investors reward.
"You go out and buy stuff," he said.

Hospital stocks, as a group, have not been strong performers as of late.
"The public hospital companies appear to be undervalued," said Jim Forbes, an investment banker at Merrill Lynch who specializes in health care.
The for-profit companies are also seeking scale and many consultants and analysts say rural hospitals may be the most tempting targets.
Companies may also seek a presence in more states so that any cutbacks to a Medicaid program in one state will have less of an impact.
"You want to have some geographic balance," Mr. Forbes said.
Merger activity is also expected among the half-dozen or so companies running rural hospitals.
Some of those companies are privately held.
Both LifePoint and Province operate rural hospitals, and in merging will run a total of 50 hospitals.

Even with the greater interest, however, no one should expect a wave of mergers similar to the activity in the 1980's and 1990's, when companies were creating huge chains of for-profit hospitals, and many nonprofit hospitals went on buying binges.
"We're not headed back to that anytime soon," said Mr. Steever, since the motivations behind mergers are so different.

While some of the for-profit hospital companies may embark in large transactions, most of the activity within the nonprofit sector is likely to be limited to individual markets, like Springfield, Ohio, a city of 65,000 where Mercy Health Partners-Western Ohio and The Community Hospital are joining forces to build a hospital to replace two existing ones.
Meanwhile, some independent-minded hospitals, analysts say, will resist any attempts to force them into the arms of financially stronger entities by forgoing badly needed investments.
"These guys will hang on until the bitter end," said Robert Fuller, the founder of Capital Markets Management, who advises hospitals.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Exactly how many hospitals will merge depends on how ugly the capital environment gets.
While many hospitals have had relatively good access to capital in recent years, some analysts say hospitals are likely to have real difficulty finding money as interest rates rise and reimbursements from insurers and the federal government becomes more tight-fisted.
What is clear, said Mr. Taylor, the analyst, is that hospitals must spend to remain competitive, and the nonprofit hospitals that are capable of doing so have been catching up with their for-profit counterparts.
"They are dramatically accelerating their capital spending," he said.
"Capital is the only competitive advantage in the hospital industry," he said.
The stakes are high, therefore, if a hospital has difficulty raising the money it needs from investors or must pay too high a rate for the privilege.
Struggling hospitals "are probably reviewing their options," said Richard L. Clarke, the chief executive of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, which represents hospital finance executives.
Some may also consider joint ventures and other arrangements with doctors and others that might provide more money to make the investments they need, he said.

Mr. Dadey said he would continue to run on the Conservative Party line, which could split the Republican vote in a three-way race in November.
All told, three Republican Senate seats are considered at risk.
Mr. Meng stands poised to become the first Asian-American to serve in the State Legislature, officials said.

Still, lawmakers here take the defeats of incumbents seriously.
Assemblyman Keith L.T.
"Hopefully we'll see a whole new Legislature this year," he said.
A lack of inflationary fears and expectations of slower growth have combined to pull longer-term interest rates sharply lower.

The power of that combination was reinforced yesterday.
The core index, which excludes food and energy, also climbed 0.1 percent and is up 1.7 percent over the last 12 months.
A reading over zero means the economy is expanding.
That was a much bigger decline than expected and was added ammunition for those who question whether the economic soft patch is over, as Fed officials have contended.

Also yesterday, Merrill Lynch economists, in a monthly report, revised their forecast for the 10-year Treasury yield and their prediction on how fast and far Federal Reserve officials will raise their benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks.

Merrill predicts that the target for the federal funds rate, now at 1.5 percent, will rise to 2 percent by November and will hold there until the end of 2005.
The yield on the 10-year note is now forecast to drop as low as 3.60 percent by the middle of next year, instead of to 4.15 percent by the end of next year.

One is that higher oil prices are slowing growth.
But just as important is that another surge in mortgage refinancing, which has been a boost to consumer spending, is not likely unless the 10-year yield falls to around 3.80 percent, she said.
That means a refinancing boom, if it occurs, is not likely until the middle of next year and may not last long if rates rise again.

In addition, she said, the stimulus from last year's tax cuts has faded and the stall in the stock market is probably discouraging some consumer spending.
Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, said, "There is a growing perception among people in the market that the Fed has finished tightening or has almost finished tightening."
But he does not agree with that outlook.
He argues that the economy is growing strongly enough for the Fed to carry through with its objective of raising the goal for the federal funds rate to what economists call neutral -- a level that neither stimulates nor slows economic activity.
And neutral, Mr. McCarthy said, is somewhere between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.

Despite this rally and the belief among some observers that the Fed will slow the pace of future rate increases, it is still expected that policy makers will raise their benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75 percent when they meet next Tuesday.
The meeting after that is scheduled for Nov. 10.
Unlike the 10-year note, the 2-year yield is not anywhere near its end-of-March level of about 1.6 percent.
That is because the 2-year yield tends to stay close to the expected federal funds rate.
Many other countries, led by Britain, France and Germany, have favored a softer approach, though a senior Bush administration official expressed confidence on Friday that the "tactical gap" in how to deal with Iran was narrowing.

Iran's nuclear program dates from the late 1960's, when it began developing nuclear energy at the urging of the United States.
In 1995, Iran signed a contract with Russia to resume work on the Busheir plant and soon began assembling centrifuges, which are used to concentrate uranium's unstable 235 isotope at levels necessary for a nuclear reaction.
Iran will need uranium with 3.5 percent of the isotope to fuel its Busheir plant.
But the same centrifuges can be used to enrich uranium to the higher levels needed for nuclear weapons.

Under the Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran has the right to enrich uranium for use in nuclear power plants, but not disclosing the enrichment program was a clear breach of its obligations under the treaty.

Last year, Britain, France and Germany persuaded Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment efforts to build confidence among the international community while it clarifies questions about its nuclear program.
Iran plans to build six more 1,000 megawatt reactors.

Since then, the International Atomic Energy Agency has been trying to answer all remaining questions about Iran's nuclear program and has carried out more than a dozen unannounced inspections of Iranian facilities.
But the United States remains certain that inconsistencies in the program and other clues point to a secret weapons program.

Most troubling to the United States is Iran's insistence on continuing its enrichment program.
While Iran says the program is to produce low-enriched uranium to fuel its Busheir power plant, the centrifuges could quickly be converted for making weapons-grade uranium.
Experts say that it will take Iran decades to build the tens of thousands of centrifuges necessary to produce a year's worth of fuel for the Busheir plant, but that it needs only about 2,000 centrifuges to make enough highly enriched uranium for one bomb a year.
It would need even fewer if it started with the low-enriched uranium promised by Russia as fuel for the Busheir plant.
It has maintained a yearlong freeze on the use of those centrifuges, but warned this week that the suspension would not be forever.

Iran raised alarms earlier this month by confirming that it was ready to convert more than 40 tons of yellowcake, or uranium oxide, into the uranium hexafluoride gas that is fed into centrifuges for enrichment.
Iran's uranium conversion plant operates under International Atomic Energy Agency controls, but the agency has urged the country to stop using the facility in order to ease international concerns.

Hossein Mousavian, who is in charge of the foreign policy committee of Iran's Supreme National security Council, said Iran was prepared to accept any initiative by the agency to ensure that its enrichment does not exceed the 3.5 percent level needed to fuel the Busheir plant.
But he said preventing Iran from enriching uranium was beyond the agency's authority.
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former Iranian president, warned Friday in Tehran that should the agency demand that the country stop its enrichment activities a complaint would be lodged against it at the International Court of Justice for acting outside its powers.
According to the current draft of the resolution, Iran must clear up "outstanding issues" in time for Mr. ElBaradei to prepare a report for the November meeting and "immediately suspend all enrichment-related activities."
It says the agency's board will decide in November "whether or not further steps are appropriate."
The vaguer language, similar to that of previous resolutions on Iran over the past year, leaves the agency the option of closing its investigation without referring the country's case to the Security Council.

The job of soup kitchen cook is not easy to fill, explained Ms. Leonardo, who has contacted other kitchens around the city to help find a new cook, so far with no success.
One person who isn't a candidate is Alfonzo Pinkney, 51, who worked as a server at St. Luke's and trained as a chef.
"I wouldn't take this job," he said.
"I like to take the time to see people enjoy food, see a smile on their face."
Mr. Pinkney, who has been homeless, likes to recall a soup kitchen, now closed, on the Upper East Side in the 80's that provided tablecloths and waiter service for a three-course meal.
Feeding 200 people within three marathon hours requires almost aerobic energy.
The cook must be able to prepare a meal solo and have energy left over to greet and serve patrons.
The job also requires cleaning up afterward, handling kettles big enough to bathe in.
And for this particular job, which will pay $12 to $14 an hour for eight hours of kitchen work per week, the successful applicant must also be comfortable working in the sweaty, near-medieval conditions of St. Luke's kitchen.

Although New York has roughly 300 soup kitchens, the one at St. Luke's, which has been serving meals since 1977 and costs $30,000 a year to operate, is distinctive in several respects.
For one thing, it is known for letting patrons return for second helpings, something not all soup kitchens allow.

For another, it operates in an unlikely space, the church's theater.
Three nights a week, the theater is home to the long-running participatory musical "Tony N' Tina's Wedding," at which time the stage is adorned with a trellis draped with artificial white roses under which the couple's vows are recited.

ON Tuesdays and Thursdays, the stage is broken down and the space is transformed into a dining area.
(Other parts of the building accommodate a Montessori preschool, the offices of the Times Square Coalition, a men's shelter, and a refugee and immigration service.)

The kitchen, which is behind the stage, is a narrow space with a black-and-white checkerboard floor, tiled walls and a 10-burner stove.
The church is using the temporary vacancy to clean the kitchen thoroughly.
The other day, three homeless men, all soup kitchen patrons who sometimes do odd jobs at the church, could be found scrubbing down the work spaces and organizing boxes of cutlery, disposable chefs' hats and other equipment with almost encyclopedic method.
Attendance comes in a monthly tide.
At the beginning of the month, the kitchen feeds 80 to 100 people a day, but as the month goes on and welfare checks are increasingly depleted, the number grows to 200.
Most of the people who are fed by the soup kitchen are single unemployed men.
While patrons of St. Luke's soup kitchen do not have to be homeless, one of the largest sponsors, United Way, stipulates that there be a sign-in policy, one result of which is that visitors often leave fake names, which the church tolerates in its mission to serve the hungry.
"One week we fed Peter Pan, on Tuesday and Thursday," said Pastor Schmiege.
Mr. Koscinski, who is 76, paced back and forth in front of the "Lost our cook" sign several times before buzzing the church's offices.
"Very far," said Mr. Koscinski, explaining that he has a hernia.
Grasping his stomach, he walked away.
Democratic and Republican pollsters say the reason for the change this year is that an issue Mr. Bush had initially pitched as part of an overall message -- which candidate would be best able to protect the United States from terrorists -- has become particularly compelling for women.
"I don't define it as a problem," Mr. Mellman said.
"I define it as an opportunity."
Just as Mr. Kerry is trying to win back women, Mr. Bush is seeking to do what Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, has vowed to do this year: challenge the Democrats on their own turf; in this case, make a pitch directly to women.
His campaign rallies often feature signs saying "W stands for Women."

On Tuesday Mr. Bush, who has presented himself as the nation's defender in chief, spoke directly of the attack this month in Russia, where extremists killed more than 300 people, half of them children, at a school.
And, the strategist said, it is one reason Mr. Kerry must now "rebuild his image on strength."
While Mr. Kerry has certainly lost support among women, some polls show he is still slightly ahead of Mr. Bush.

Ms. Feldman would not disclose the campaign's numbers but said they showed Mr. Kerry's standing with women "below what we would expect in exit polls on Election Day, and we have room for growth."
She added, "we're winning them, but not by as much as we will."

Mr. Mellman put it this way: "We have every expectation that those undecideds will break toward John Kerry, but John Kerry is making a very concerted effort to reach out to precisely those women voters."

Mr. Kerry has been endorsed by a half-dozen Sept. 11 widows, and his campaign has deployed a group of "military moms" whose children are serving in Iraq to speak on his behalf in several swing states.
"You've seen women much, much more concerned than men that an attack could happen in their hometown," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who specializes in female voters.
"That's very, very unnerving to women."

While women in the Times/CBS poll saw both Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush as able to make the right decisions about protecting the country from another terrorist attack, they expressed more confidence in Mr. Bush.
Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said that when voters are asked, "Are you worried about being a target of a terrorist attack?"

Traditionally, there is a gap between married women and single women, with married women voting more Republican and single women voting more Democratic.
This year, Ms. Lake said, the gap between how married and single women expect to vote is greater than it has ever been, largely because of the emergence of what analysts call "security moms," who tend to be white, married women who have children and who are fearful of another attack within the United States.

"Security moms" are an outgrowth of the "soccer moms" who had emerged in previous elections as important swing voters.
But soccer moms tended to live mainly in the suburbs and could vote either way.
Security moms live everywhere and are leaning Republican.
In the Times/CBS News poll, married women who are registered to vote were far more likely to say they would vote for Mr. Bush (59 percent) than for Mr. Kerry (32 percent).
"There's a tension among middle-class women who are attracted by Bush's perceived strength on terrorism and concerns about his poor performance on the domestic agenda," Mr. Kohut said.
"They will be the story of this election: the way women make this choice."
"Now," he said, "Bush has more solid strength among men than Kerry has among women, and if Kerry can't match that margin among women, he will lose."

Ann McLaughlin Korologos, the presiding director of the board, released a statement on Wednesday morning, saying, "The board takes the report seriously and is working with Ofheo to resolve these matters."
The board has hired former Senator Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, who is now a partner in Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, as an independent counsel.
It has also created a committee of independent directors to work with the government regulators.
Specifically, the report criticizes the company for accounting methods used on amortization and derivatives, which it uses to hedge against interest rate and other risks, saying that its methods did not comply with generally accepted accounting practices.

The report accused the chief financial officer, Tim Howard, of having failed "to provide adequate oversight to key control and reporting functions within Fannie Mae."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

With $1 trillion in assets and $53.8 billion in revenue, Fannie Mae ranks as the country's 20th-largest industrial corporation and is second among the three largest financial institutions in the country, between Citigroup and the Bank of America.

The investigation was prompted by accounting scandals last year at Freddie Mac, the corporate cousin of Fannie Mae, which resulted in the ousting of several senior executives and a $125 million fine.
At the time, Fannie Mae's management had asserted that similar problems would not be found at Fannie Mae.

The ongoing investigation is likely to give ammunition to lawmakers who have been pushing for tighter oversight of the two mortgage companies, which are government chartered but publicly traded.
Until recently they had been exempt from filing to the S.E.C.
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, began urging Congress last October to tighten regulation over the two rapidly growing corporations, which own or back almost half of the mortgages in the United States.
Fueled by the housing market boom, Fannie Mae's mortgage portfolio has nearly doubled in the last five years, to $895.4 billion from $481 billion.
In April, the Senate Banking Committee passed a proposal along a near party-line vote to strengthen government regulation, but no action has been taken by the full Senate.
Ofheo has a budget of $38 million and 180 employees to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together have over 8,000 employees and a combined $90 billion in revenue.
"There have been those who, following the Freddie Mac scandal, insisted that it was not a big enough deal to require legislative action to improve the oversight of these housing finance giants," said Congressman Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana, who is chairman of the subcommittee that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
"In light of today's revelations about Fannie Mae, my response is: Fool us once, shame on you.
Fool us twice, shame on us."

The report said that management had wide latitude in estimates of crucial factors in computing its earnings, which it could use "to hit an earnings number."
Because those same manipulated numbers were used to analyze Fannie Mae's sensitivity to changes in interest rates, the report said, "this practice has unfavorable safety and soundness implications that go beyond financial reporting."

At the heart of the dispute is perhaps the most complex accounting rule in existence, known as SFAS 133, a statement of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
That rule requires companies to account for derivative securities at market value but allows them to keep those changes from affecting earnings if the derivatives are used to hedge specified exposures.
"This lack of documentation and the ability to create such documentation retroactively is not only an SFAS 133 violation, but is evidence of a poor control framework and is a significant safety and soundness problem," the report said.
The accounting rule at issue is similar to Statement 39 of the International Accounting Standards Board, which is now the subject of a dispute in Europe.
The European Commission, under pressure from banks who fear it would cause earnings to be too volatile, is expected to allow companies to ignore significant parts of the rule.
For Fannie Mae, the controversy may leave it more vulnerable to political opponents who want to reduce the benefits it receives from the lower interest rates it commands because it could call on the Treasury for some help if it ran into problems.
The amount of such help is relatively small, but many investors have assumed more would be available if needed, and thus have been willing to lend money at low rates to Fannie Mae.

It may be that in making itself more attractive to stock market investors by reporting steadily growing earnings, Fannie Mae took steps that will damage the most important advantage it had.
Meanwhile, on the streets of the sprawling West District -- which includes some of Newark's more well-kept, middle-income areas, as well as blocks pockmarked with abandoned and boarded-up buildings -- reaction to the reports of such a rogue unit ran from knowing winks to grudging belief to incredulity.
In another development, the Office of the New Jersey Public Defender, which represents many indigent criminal suspects, said it was searching the records of arrests and convictions in which the officers might have figured.
"We want to see whether we can seek any legal relief," he said.

While the report is a scathing rebuke to Fannie Mae, its conclusions could probably be applied to many other companies.
The question is, can investors handle these truths, given how unlovely they are?
For example, will investors finally realize that no matter what management says, companies cannot produce smooth and steady earnings growth from their operations, quarter after quarter?
We live in a volatile world with highs and lows, peaks and valleys.
Any company that claims to produce predictable growth -- and so many still do -- can watch its nose grow.
INVESTORS also learned from the report that when bonuses are at risk, executives will think nothing of manipulating numbers to remove the threat.
In 1998, for example, Fannie Mae was facing the possibility of having to record an expense of $400 million.
Sure, the company's earnings would have been reduced if it took the expense, but more important, its executives' bonuses would be diminished.

Abracadabra!

Then there is the revelation that companies like Fannie Mae think that following accounting rules is for girlie men.
It used less onerous hedge accounting, shifting losses to a line on its balance sheet known as "other comprehensive income."
Never mind that it could not justify the move in many cases.
Which leads to another revelation that Fannie Mae's fans must now face: that the company is grossly undercapitalized.
Its equity capital of roughly 2 percent is much lower than the 8 percent required of "A"-rated banks, according to Sean Egan of the Egan-Jones Ratings Company.
"Our view is the lack of diversification argues for a greater level of equity."

Raising capital in this environment will be difficult, to say the least.
But Fannie Mae's regulator may force the issue, said Josh Rosner, a financial services analyst at Medley Global Advisors, a policy and regulatory research firm in New York.
"If a company is deemed to be unsafe or unsound, the regulator may require it to hold capital in excess of statutory required capital until the problems have been addressed on a remedial basis," Mr. Rosner said.
"We don't even know how much they'd have to raise, because the alleged accounting problems mean current capital may be misstated.
But they will have a significant restraint on their ability to grow for some time.
That is unquantifiable."
The report's description of Fannie Mae's accounting practices raises doubts about the company's claims to efficiency and profitability, according to Bert Ely, a financial consultant at Ely & Company in Alexandria, Va. "To what extent has Fannie underestimated its cost of doing business by rolling those losses into other comprehensive income?"
"Is this going to lead to higher costs that reduce their profitability or will they try to pass that through to homeowners as higher interest rates, which would argue against their existence?"

Another lesson from the report is that employees who speak out about misconduct at their companies are often ignored.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Also troubling is the fact that Fannie Mae's problems have implications for the entire mortgage market.
Are its other systems similarly weak?
That is no small question.
Most of the mortgages underwritten in the nation today use automated programs designed by Fannie Mae.
"If allegations that they engineered systems for growth without regard to safety and soundness are correct, other systems, including underwriting, appraisal and loss mitigation systems should be called into question as well," Mr. Rosner said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

As the report makes clear, executive bonuses and smooth earnings were viewed by Fannie Mae as far more important than accurate financial statements.
The report cited an internal memo written in 1999 extolling the benefits of a brand of software Fannie Mae used when trying to assess how much income or expense should be recognized on securities and loans.
The software, the memo said, allowed a user "to manipulate factors to produce an array of recognition streams," which "strengthens the earnings management that is necessary when dealing with a volatile book of business."
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

This nugget means that Fannie Mae is probably not alone in playing fast and loose with financial reality.
That there is software out there designed to let corporate users manipulate figures to get whatever answer they desire certainly indicates that other companies want to obfuscate, too.
INDEED, that is the larger and most dispiriting lesson to be gleaned from this debacle.
But the company that comes through in the regulatory report is probably not an anomaly.
In other words, Fannie Mae is not the only cook in the kitchen.
She has lots of company.
And they're spoiling the broth.

"We have finally explained the functional purpose of this strange, long neck," said Dr. Olivier Rieppel of the Field Museum in Chicago.
The newfound species has been named Dinocephalosaurus orientalis, which means "terrible-headed lizard from the Orient."

Aquatic animals face a problem feeding in a dense medium like water have a problem that animals on dry land do not, Dr. Rieppel said.
Any quick movement toward the prey not only alerts it of an attack but also creates a pressure wave that can push the prey away.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Fish and some turtles solve the problem with suction feeding.
They pull the prey into their mouths by rapidly expanding the mouth cavity.
And a variation of this is apparently what Dinocephalosaurus did with its long, strong neck.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The scientists -- Dr. Rieppel, Dr. Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago and Dr. Chun Li, a researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing -- concluded that when this reptile thrust its head forward to capture prey, the ribs along its neck would splay outward.
This increased the diameter of the esophagus, creating a suction force.
The suction would thus swallow the pressure wave created by the reptile's lunging head, minimizing the chance of forewarning the victim, and would swallow the prey too.
It also has competition from at least four other companies in the Bay Area, and additional developers are preparing to jump on the bandwagon.

"There is a wave here, but we don't know how big it is," admitted Robert Eves, Venture Commerce's chief executive.

But subsequent calls from other small businesses seeking similar spaces convinced Mr. Eves that there was a solid market for offices under 3,000 square feet.
The project quickly sold out, prompting the firm to plan more centers.
Business owners, meanwhile, were approaching other Bay Area developers and brokers with similar requests.
Memories of skyrocketing rents and space shortages during the dot-com boom of the late 1990's apparently provided the initial motivation.

According to Mark Levin, president of Cypress Bay Ventures in Larkspur, Calif., low interest rates, investment potential and the tax advantages of ownership also play major roles in the rapidly growing market.
Mr. Levin and his partners are converting a building they developed in Petaluma, Calif., into condominiums after failing to lease any of the 43,000 square feet of offices.

"People can get financing for about what they're paying for rent," said Mr. Levin, who estimated that the after-tax carrying costs for units in his building would be equivalent to a monthly rent of about $2 a square foot.
Commercial condo prices vary considerably, depending on a project's quality, level of finishing and location.
Mr. Levin quoted rates of $185 to $200 a square foot for unfinished offices in his project, with interior improvements costing $40 a square foot on average.

Nonetheless, Mr. Manley says the market may be too narrow to sustain much more development.
He also says that rising interest rates will make purchasing a much less attractive option.

"Even if only a small percentage want to own, that's a lot of buyers."
As for interest rates, he said: "They go up when the economy improves, and when the economy improves, rents also go up.
So while it will cost more to buy, it will also cost more to rent."
Business is brisk at commercial condominium projects.
According to Mr. Lovewell, the response has been exceptionally strong at a 130,000-square-foot project that his firm is completing in San Rafael, 20 miles north of San Francisco.
Units, which can be finished for either office or warehouse use, sell for $175 to $275 a square foot.

If there is some degree of cruelty in all comedy, there is more than some in "Platée," Jean-Philippe Rameau's comédie-lyrique from 1745 about an amphibian-like marsh nymph who has appointed herself the grande dame of the swamp where she lives.
Mark Morris, who has directed and choreographed the New York City Opera's enchanting production, which opened on Tuesday night (running through Oct. 16), and Isaac Mizrahi, the fashion designer who created the wildly imaginative costumes, are not afraid of the meanness that runs through the story.
So all night you feel a little guilty laughing at the fate of Platée, which is just, I'm sure, as Rameau intended.
Platée's troubles start when Jupiter, fed up with the constant jealousy of his wife, Juno, whose rages are causing storms and havoc for mortals on earth, decides to teach her a lesson, a ruse hatched by King Cithéron.
Jupiter will pretend to court the homely, lovelorn but thoroughly vain marsh nymph.
When Juno realizes how absurd her rival is, she will realize that her chronic jealousies are groundless.
If Rameau had conceived Platée for soprano, the meanness in the story might have been untenable.
We are more willing to laugh at a woman being made fun of for her ugliness if we know she is really a man.
Some members of Congress continued to call upon the Bush administration to end the subsidies immediately, a power that the Government Accountability Office has said the Education Department clearly has.
But in a letter to Republican leaders, Rod Paige, the education secretary, rebutted that contention, saying that Congressional action offered "the most direct and expeditious" path to closing the loophole.

Just how expeditiously Congress can act is still unclear.
While all parties in the debate -- including the student loan companies themselves -- agree that the payments should be curtailed, an atmosphere of partisanship and recrimination has permeated many of the legislative efforts to do so.

Though the House passed an amendment to address at least part of the issue early last month almost unanimously, other efforts have been squashed or stalled, at times by the very lawmakers proposing legislation yesterday.
Congress eliminated the guarantee by 1993, eventually moving to a system that is more closely tied to the market, but it allowed some lenders to keep collecting the higher interest rates from the government on money they had already raised -- a potential windfall in a market in which students are paying less than 3.4 percent in interest on their loans.

Moreover, some of the lenders who originally qualified for the guarantee have been converted into, or have been subsumed by, commercial companies, putting greater emphasis on the search for profits.
Don't look now, but there's something large and scary lurking just outside your door, ready to disrupt your life at the drop of a utility bill.
No, it's not a telemarketer.
It's your credit score, a report card of sorts on your bill-paying habits.
If the score is too low, this creature could put its gnarled fist between you and a mortgage or a car loan -- or at least force you to pay a higher interest rate.
This, clearly, is a creature you should know.
But to most people, it's a relative stranger.
Fully 28 percent of people believe, incorrectly, that maxing out a credit card will improve the score, according to a survey by Opinion Research for the Consumer Federation of America and Providian Financial, a credit-card provider.
Only 13 percent know that a good score is one that is at least in the 700's --on a range of 350 to 850 -- -- and just 34 percent understand that a score simply measures risk of default, not income or age.

Still, the unsettling message from the campaigns is that the majority isn't worth a bet.
The battleground -- lately measured as shrinking to perhaps three to six states rated most in play in the Electoral College vote -- is receiving a grossly lopsided share of moneyed wooing and candidates' visits, whether locals like it or not.
Ever since March, the most crucial places like Ohio have been suffering saturation ad levels that used to be normal in October, according to Ken Goldstein, the project director.
"A campaign manager's worst fear is to wake up the day after the election and have a dollar left unspent in his account," he says of the targeted binge.

From the researchers' replay screens, modern political advertising comes across as the cynical art of shrewdly ignoring most of the people most of the time.
And if that sounds depressing, there's even less hope offered by the university's companion program that searches out "free media" -- political coverage on local television news, which most Americans cite as their main way to be informed.

This search through programs fed from the Nielsen Monitor-Plus television research files finds needles in happy-talk haystacks.
A study of 122 stations in the top 50 markets found only 44 percent of local stations offering any campaign coverage at all in the 2002 elections.
In the few times a candidate actually gets on screen, he or she averages a 12-second sound bite.
Not quite enough time for robust debate about broadcasters and the public trust.
In this campaign's harvest, scores of students track 325 hours of news programs a day, facing America's legions of beaming anchor couples far more often than its politicians.
"Ah, those plastic smiling faces," says one doctoral couch potato.
She is attempting to determine if the stations will top their egregious average last time in which there were almost four times as many local campaign ads as political stories.
Perversely, one study found there's more useful and engaging information in a political ad -- particularly a negative ad -- than in a local campaign story.
It may be darkly encouraging, then, that candidates' ads are typically growing more negative as Election Day approaches.
"Some real nasty stuff," says Professor Goldstein as his students glean the shrouded battleground.
"American Express has something that Visa and MasterCard don't have, and that's cachet," said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, who predicted that some banks will "kick the tires" and issue cards with the American Express brand.

Mr. Chenault stressed that American Express would continue to focus on wealthy customers, rather than pursuing a mass-market strategy.
That has been a profitable but highly competitive niche for card companies; 10 percent of all credit card customers account for a quarter of all spending, Mr. Robertson said.
While partnerships with banks would provide American Express with opportunities for growth, there would be financial risks.
American Express, analysts noted, would forgo much of the revenues from these new customers because its bank partners would receive any annual fees, as well as a large portion of the fees that merchants pay on each sale.

Discover has already been in discussions with banks to issue both debit and credit cards, too.
But analysts say that Discover, a unit of Morgan Stanley, may find it difficult to attract a significant amount of new business, because its brand is less distinctive.
"American Express still faces the problem it has always faced," said a statement from Visa.
MasterCard's general counsel, Noah J. Hanft, said in a statement that he was confident that banks would discover that any new venture would "benefit American Express more than it benefits them or their cardholders."

Banks that teamed up with American Express would likely promote some variation on American Express's famous rewards program, rather than offering a low interest rate or other benefits, said Robert McKinley, chief executive of CardWeb.com.
But some of the new cards could charge annual fees, as American Express does for many of its cards.
Mr. McKinley said he doubted that the new offers would be so immediately compelling that large numbers of consumers would rush to dump their Visa and MasterCards, especially since more merchants accept those cards than American Express or Discover.

Most of the shares they will buy are not new, but rather are owned by creditors who accepted them in lieu of some $900 million in debt back in 2000.

For this group, this week's sale represents a chance to cash out.

"Just when creditors thought they would get stuck for 10 years, high oil prices have bailed them out," said Kitti Nathisuwan, an energy analyst at Macquarie Securities in Bangkok.
Thai Oil has a 21 percent share of Thailand's market for refined petroleum products, including gasoline and diesel fuel.
After a year of bargaining between the company and its 140 creditors, including Chase Manhattan Bank, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and three of Thailand's largest banks, lenders in 2000 agreed to take 49 percent of the company.

But then began Thai Oil's miraculous recovery.
By lowering interest rates and stimulating credit, Mr. Thaksin created a consumer boom, which in turn stimulated demand for fuel.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Though his subsequent efforts to privatize fat government-owned corporations have had only mixed success, Mr. Thaksin scored a major success in 2001 when his government managed to sell 30 percent of PTT, which has a monopoly on gas transmission and owns 49 percent of Thai Oil.
China's rapid growth increased demand for raw materials, creating a boom in demand for Thai rice and rubber, which in turn raised demand for fuel to run generators and farmers' pickup trucks.
Since then, profit margins for refiners in Asia have risen to their highest since 1996.
Yet refineries cannot meet demand.
Increased demand for oil and limited supplies have had a marked effect on Thai Oil's bottom line.
Refining margins jumped from their 2001 level of $1.35 a barrel to $6.47 a barrel this year.

Some analysts believe oil prices are bound to come down as competitors raise capacity and supplies.
Others nonetheless predict refining margins have further to climb because of capacity constraints in Thailand.
"We don't think it's peaked yet," said Ms. Rujivatra at CLSA.

Now it is expecting to rake in even more in what analysts predict will be a heavily oversubscribed offering.
The company will sell 900 million shares for between 27 baht and 32 baht each (65 cents to 77 cents).
Only 90 million of the shares on offer are new; the rest belong to creditors.
Of the combined offering, roughly 38 percent is reserved for foreign institutions, 13 percent for Thai institutions.
Underwriters have allocated less than 7 percent for local individuals to buy.
The rest of the shares will go either back to creditors or to PTT and its affiliates.
PTT will maintain its 49 percent stake, swapping other refining assets for shares.

The underwriters, led by J.P. Morgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, will announce the average offering price Oct. 13.
The shares are scheduled to begin trading by the end of this month.
All is not clear on Thailand's economic horizon, however.
A slowing global economy has cooled exports, and rising household debt has hurt domestic spending, with consumers vulnerable to rising interest rates.
Thailand's government has already lowered its forecast for economic growth this year, to no more than 6.5 percent from earlier predictions of 8 percent.

Thailand imports most of its crude oil, so rising prices are another threat to economic growth.
Economists say Thailand is more vulnerable to rising crude oil prices than any other country in Southeast Asia.
"It's a major threat," said Wong Chee Seng, regional economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.
"Business costs have increased quite dramatically."
Thailand's imports of crude and other petroleum products rose 15 percent in the first six months of this year, helping to push it into a trade deficit, which Mr. Wong warns is putting pressure on interest rates.

But a slowing economy is unlikely to have much impact on Thailand's oil demand, analysts and economist say, because prices for companies and consumers are kept artificially low by government subsidies.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Early this year, Thailand began subsidizing the price of fuel, joining Malaysia, Indonesia and China on the list of Asian governments that spend taxpayer funds to soften the impact of higher oil prices.
Thailand is now on track to spend more than $1 billion this year to keep retail prices for gasoline and diesel fuel from rising as fast as the price of crude.
While it has allowed prices for gasoline to rise somewhat, it has stood firm on the price of diesel fuel, which is used predominantly by company trucks and by farmers, who are crucial to Mr. Thaksin's political support.
Analysts say the government is unlikely to touch the subsidies until at least after elections, which are due by next February.
Even then, they say, it is unlikely to make deep cuts in diesel subsidies.
And if it manages to phase subsidies out slowly, analysts say, demand for fuel is likely to remain strong.
"Demand wouldn't fall that much," said Mr. Kitti at Macquarie.

Better still, the government has provided some insurance for fuel demand in the form of a promise to spend $6.8 billion over the next five years building new railways and highways.
All that construction, analysts say, will require heavy machinery that burn lots and lots of the fuel that Thai Oil already cannot pump out of its refineries fast enough to meet demand.

For the past 15 years, the West in general and Washington in particular have let Syria do what it wants here as long as Syria delivered on the peace efforts, figuring any outstanding issues about who controls Lebanon could be ironed out in any final Middle East settlement.

Some analysts say the armed camp that Lebanon was before the civil war erupted in 1975 no longer exists, especially because the Palestine Liberation Organization is long gone.
The United States and its other allies believe that Lebanon is stable enough to stand on its own feet, and that Syrian interference is retarding the emergence of a true Lebanese democracy.
They accuse Syria of violating the spirit of the Taif accord, which ended the Lebanese civil war in 1990, by not meeting the timetable of a few years for withdrawing its forces.

Some Lebanese analysts note that the sometimes violent rivalry between Shiite groups, the phenomenon of Sunni fundamentalism and the return of Christian warlords have all been kept in check by the Syrian presence, not to mention armed Palestinian groups.

That is still a strongly held view among some economists who criticized the Nobel award to Mr. Prescott and Mr. Kydland.
"I am not alone in feeling that the Kydland-Prescott model of business cycles was a significant step backward," said Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.
Some economists argue that the Prescott-Kydland paper, rather than rule out demand as a cause of business cycle fluctuation, simply added supply shocks as an additional cause.
The first paper cited in the Nobel award, titled "Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans," is considered by many economists to be a valid and innovative framework for considering public policy over a wide range -- not only Fed interest rate policy but policies on such matters as building homes on flood plains.
If houses go up in such high-risk areas and a flood destroys them, policy makers are faced with the question of whether to provide aid to help the victims rebuild or to let them bear the financial burden of rebuilding.
Prescott-Kydland would say it is best not to provide aid, because in the long run it is better if homes are not constructed on flood plains where there is a risk of their being destroyed.
While the government typically extends aid, of course, the Prescott-Kydland perspective is a useful tool for examining such policy issues, says Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist.

But since Mr. Bush was facing a downturn, not the boom in which he formulated his tax plans, it would have been much wiser to adjust to reality and enact measures to increase consumption, which leads more directly to job and income growth.
Fully 37 percent of the cost of Mr. Bush's fiscal policies went to cutting the top tax rates on income, estates, dividends and capital gains, a tactic that does little to spur consumption.
The other economic drivers -- consumption, job growth and income gains -- got short shrift, and are now even weaker than they would otherwise have been.
Writing in The Times Magazine last month, Roger Lowenstein recounted a conversation in which Mr. Bush asked Glenn Hubbard, then his top economics adviser, what to do about the sagging job numbers.
Mr. Hubbard told him not to let short-term numbers sway him from tax cuts.
Those short-term numbers have been bad for nearly four years now.
In the meantime, the tax cuts have blown a hole in the federal budget.
Conventional wisdom holds that the deficit -- now $415 billion -- does not affect employment because its effects are too abstract to be factored into day-to-day hiring decisions.
That's only half-true.
Hiring reflects confidence, and financial markets certainly watch the deficit.
As the job situation fails to improve and the deficit restricts the nation's ability to respond, the markets react.
Even more ominous, the dollar fell against most major currencies, which could make it harder to finance America's outsized deficits and lead to rapidly rising interest rates.
True to the belief that tax cuts will eventually prove to be a cure-all, the administration has offered no meaningful relief to struggling Americans.
In fact, Mr. Bush signed another tax cut last week and is expected to sign a deeply misguided corporate tax cut soon.
Federal unemployment benefits expired at the end of 2003 and three million people have exhausted their state benefits since then.
The administration has balked at raising the minimum wage, now at its lowest level since 1949, relative to the average wage.
And the Labor Department has effectively thwarted the 2002 law that was to have helped Americans who lose their manufacturing jobs to outsourcing.

Much of the new emphasis comes from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a philanthropist who routinely stresses the importance of volunteerism to his aides.
The mayor does not hesitate to personally ask celebrities, like Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, to volunteer their time.
Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who draws only $1 a year for a salary, even jokes that he volunteers as the mayor.
"He left a legacy of volunteerism at his company and he also hopes to leave a legacy in New York," said Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris, who oversees the city's volunteer efforts.
Under his administration, the Mayor's Volunteer Center has been transformed from a largely overlooked office that drew about 1,500 potential volunteers a year into an Internet-savvy operation that now reaches more than 10 times that number.
The center, which has an annual budget of $244,298 and a staff of four, was moved last year to the Municipal Building, next to the Mayor's Office of Special Events.
"Our strength is that we're facilitators, and we're a resource, and we're a clearinghouse."

The center's Web site, www.nyc.gov/volunteer, lists one-time volunteer opportunities and links to 10 of the largest city agencies and nonprofit groups, along with their contact information.
According to Ms. Parvizi's count, the site receives about 4,000 hits a month.
Nearly 10,000 e-mail subscribers have signed up for a monthly newsletter, and 13,000 names will soon be added to that list, culled from among the volunteers for the Republican convention.

In addition, the center has publicized its activities on 311, the city's information hot line.
But the biggest change is still to come.
For the past year, the center has been working with United Way of New York City to develop a searchable database that will allow people to look for specific activities in their neighborhoods by typing in their ZIP codes.
Or they can search by areas of interest, days available and particular skills.

More than 300 city agencies and nonprofit groups have already listed roughly 1,000 volunteer opportunities in the new interactive database.
The center, which screens all the information to verify its accuracy and to make sure it is current, is planning to unveil the database later this fall.
"The message here is anybody can volunteer, even the busiest New Yorker," said Bertina Ceccarelli, a senior vice president for United Way in the city.

"By doing this, it allows a central place for all the organizations that provide volunteer activities to be listed," she said.
"It's helping us get the word out."
For hard-pressed city agencies, the steady stream of volunteers has also become a way to supplement their government operations.
For example, the center dispatched several people last month to send out a mass mailing for the city's Commission on Women's Issues, and it is currently recruiting students to visit more than 300 senior centers overseen by the Department for the Aging.

The Parks Department has seen a growing number of its volunteers come through the Internet and 311, in addition to the more traditional means of recruitment through neighborhood fliers.

But the city's outreach efforts have also benefited the volunteers, allowing them to give something back to the place they live.
The activities may bring together neighbors for a few hours in pursuit of a worthy cause, or in the case of the Saipan last weekend, strangers wanting to help who have come from afar.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 - Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Friday that the long-term outlook for global oil supplies is reassuring even though anxiety about dwindling reserves has helped push spot prices to nearly $55 a barrel.
Mr. Greenspan carefully avoided giving even the slightest hint of how this year's surge in oil prices might affect the Fed's plan to raise interest rates over the next year.
But he did acknowledge that higher oil import costs have reduced the country's gross domestic product by about 0.75 percent this year.
More disturbing than the run-up in spot prices, Mr. Greenspan said, has been the sharp rise in the price of long-term futures contracts for oil that would be delivered as late as 2010.
This time around, long-term prices have climbed to about $35.
"Unlike past concerns, the current situation reflects an increasing fear that existing reserves and productive capacity have become subject to potential geopolitical adversity," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech here to the National Italian American Foundation, according to a text of his remarks.
"These anxieties patently are not frivolous, given the stark realities evident in many areas of the world."
There are sound economic reasons for the Bush administration, or any administration, to encourage thrift.
Greater savings leads to greater capital investment, which spurs economic growth, and robust growth would take much of the pain out of dealing with thorny problems like long-term budget deficits and insolvent entitlement programs.
There are also drawbacks: critics say that many of the proposals would make deficits worse by draining away tax revenue, and it is far from clear how the privatized Social Security accounts could be paid for without cutting benefits.

But the real obstacles to forging a society in which people save more and spend less may be more fundamental questions of culture and psychology.
Do Americans really want to become a nation of scrimpers, squirreling away spare cash to avoid taxes in the short term and amass assets in the long term?
Or do we want to remain a "bon temps" society that lives for today and deals with consequences later?
Americans certainly like to own things, and to invest.
Some 53 million households representing 91.2 million people -- 47 percent of all Americans -- owned stocks or mutual funds as of July 2003, according to the Investment Company Institute.
But they don't save much.
Decades of relentless urgings to borrow more and spend more, from the onslaught of junk-mail credit card pitches to the devotion of whole magazines to goods rather than words, have turned Americans into voracious consuming machines.

What's more, there are reasons to think that trying to encourage more savings by offering more tax breaks would be like giving sun lamps to San Diegans.
The tax code already offers a dizzying array of favored savings vehicles, but hardly anyone bothers to use them to the fullest.
In 2001, only 8.4 percent of people with 401(k) accounts made the maximum contributions to them, according to Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.

As a result, critics see little point in expanding the limits on such savings.
"If you're not putting away $3,000 in an I.R.A., the fact that you can put away $10,000 won't encourage you to save more," said Peter Orszag, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Tax incentives to borrow and invest certainly work -- look at the tax deduction for mortgage interest, which has helped push home ownership up to about 70 percent of American households, a record high.
And narrowly focused incentives have also shown results -- the "529" tax-sheltered college savings accounts introduced in the late 1990'sattracted $35.2 billion in assets by late 2003.
"We're not going to get anywhere near 100 percent pickup for any program," said Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.

And that highlights the ultimate paradox about efforts to spur greater savings.
Open-walleted consumers have been the main engine of economic growth in recent years, and anything that leads them to spend less threatens the short-term health of the economy, and by extension, the political fortunes of whoever is in office.
So, though governments always want people to save like penny-pinching Depression survivors for the long term, they also want them to keep on spending like have-it-all Baby Boomers now.
Unfortunately, most Americans have to choose between the two.

"If all we have funding our current account imbalance is the good graces of foreign central banks, we are on increasingly thin ice," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley.
Of Washington's call for China to stop interfering in currency markets, he cautioned, "That could come back and bite us."
Not all economists are that worried about the growing shortfall in the current account, the broadest measure of trade, pointing out that it is sustainable as long as Asians continue on a path of export-led growth that requires cheap currencies against the dollar.
Many economists stress, however, that this symbiotic balance between Asian and American economies will eventually come to an end.

Jeffrey Frankel, an economics professor at Harvard University, said: "The Asians are going to go on buying Treasury securities for a while, preventing the dollar from depreciating and helping keep U.S. interest rates low, which is a good thing.
But not forever."

Morris Goldstein of the Institute for International Economics remarked, "This can be a story for one year or two years, not for 10 years."
If the United States were to temper its appetite for foreign money, the Chinese and Japanese could curtail their purchases of American securities without causing financial havoc.
The dollar could then drift lower against Asian currencies, benefiting American exporters and manufacturers that compete with Asian imports.

But this would require Americans to increase their rate of savings.
Household savings have plummeted to only 1.5 percent of personal income, from 11 percent 20 years ago.
With the federal government running a budget deficit of 3.5 percent of the nation's output, the public sector hardly contributes to savings.
A disorderly situation would occur if foreign money dried up suddenly when the United States still needed it.
Then, the adjustment in American savings might happen involuntarily.
Interest rates would rise sharply, and the dollar could fall abruptly.
This could induce a sharp economic contraction, even stagflation.
"The longer we wait," Mr. Goldstein said, "the more likely we'll have the adjustment anyway.
But the adjustment will be more chaotic and sharper."

Pitcairn Island, with a total population of 47 (the total includes eight permanent outsiders), is the most remote inhabited island in the world, an outcrop of only about two and a half square miles lying halfway between New Zealand and Peru.
Now, with the trials under way and the defendants insisting their accusers are exaggerating and most of the women standing by their men, the case has raised questions, in many of the islanders' minds, at least, whether the West's fundamental legal standards have a place in one of the world's strangest places.
Life is plain here, with no paved roads, sewer pipes, airstrip or even a telephone network.
Some houses have no running water.
Few outsiders have spent much time on Pitcairn, partly because the locals insist that all visitors be individually approved by a meeting of the Pitcairn Island Council.

Their accusations have created the present trial, a surreal blend of history and reality television that has captured the world's attention.

All the outsiders are living within the community, constantly bumping into defendants and victims in the church, at the post office, at the swimming hole.

Mr. Trichet said there was no timetable for countries to adopt the euro, echoing what is by now the conventional wisdom here: with the exception of Estonia and one or two of its Baltic neighbors, none of these countries will be ready for the euro until the end of the decade.

That is a remarkable turnabout from the heady days just before the expansion of the European Union, when political leaders in Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and Bratislava talked about adopting the euro in short order.
Now, in Prague, the finance ministry and the central bank are squabbling about whether the Czech Republic can meet even the less ambitious deadline of 2010.
The reason for much of the backsliding, experts say, is the political upheaval that erupted in many countries after they entered the union.

Hungary's high rates are necessary to prevent runaway inflation, Mr. Bod said.
The answer to the government's woes, he said, is to curb state borrowing.
Its budget deficit is equal to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product -- well above the 3 percent cap mandated by Brussels.
The Czech Republic has also struggled to stem a tide of red ink.
Its deficit peaked at 12.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2003, before falling to an estimated 5 percent this year.
That volatility prompted the deputy governor of the Czech central bank, Ludek Niedermayer, to question whether the country will achieve its goal of reducing the deficit to below 3 percent by 2008.

But critics say that Europe's demand for fiscal discipline is ringing hollow at a time when 5 of the 12 euro countries -- including the two largest, Germany and France -- are in violation of the deficit rules.
Mr. Trichet said the situation led to an "obvious" question regarding the deteriorating fiscal situation of the would-be members.
If Germany and France do not abide by the rules, why should other countries?

Still, the new countries have shown little sign of trying to use the Germans and the French as an alibi for their own fiscal problems.
Analysts say these countries recognize that they have to meet the requirements to get into the club before they can question the club's rules.
The bigger issue, some experts said, is that the race to adopt the euro has become less urgent for most countries.
They are struggling with thorny problems, like chronic unemployment, inflation and bankrupt pension systems, which a new currency will not solve.
"It wouldn't be in the interest of these countries to be in the euro zone right now," said Katinka Barysch, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London.

What's needed to control the costs and to provide basic health and hospitalization coverage for all Americans is an independent agency that would set national health care policy, collect medical fees, pay claims, reimburse doctors fairly and restrain runaway drug prices -- a single-payer system that would eliminate the costly, inefficient bureaucracy generated by thousands of different plans.
It's not such a radical idea; a single-payer system already exists for Medicare.
Such an agency would need to be free of politics and could be modeled on the Federal Reserve System, whose members are appointed to terms that do not coincide with the terms of either the president or the Senate.
It could be financed through two taxes, a gross-receipts business tax and a flat tax, similar to Medicare, but on all individual income.
Under a single-payer system, never again would you be asked, when calling to make a medical appointment, "What type of insurance do you have?"

A unified, single-payer system could do more than pay the bills.
It could gather information to more accurately identify the surgical procedures and drugs that work, and those that don't.
It could funnel research money to where it will do the most good rather than to those areas with the largest and most vocal constituency, thereby treating the victims of various diseases and conditions more equitably.
It could make possible a centralized computer network to reduce the 100,000 deaths each year from adverse drug reactions -- a number of fatalities five times greater than those caused by street drugs like cocaine and heroin.
Similarly, a nationwide network could track medical errors across the country to increase accountability and to identify hospitals or surgeons who make repeated mistakes.
And it could guarantee supplies of needed medications.
In short, over time such a system could transform the practice of medicine and give all Americans the first-class health care they deserve -- without breaking the bank.

In 1995, the authority took $169 million out of passengers' subway, bus and commuter rail fares -- or about 7 percent -- to make debt payments.
This year, it will take $401 million, or about 12 percent.
It projects that by 2008, the figure will reach $849 million, or about 24 percent of the income from fares.
Today, that figure is more than $14 billion, and the agency projects that the total will approach $20 billion by 2008.
In that period, it also predicts deficits rising to more than $1 billion a year.
All of those figures are overly optimistic, says the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat, who forecasts $2 billion-a-year deficits.

New York has gone through a profound shift in how transit is paid for -- away from government and onto the riders -- a change that was a stated, early policy of Gov.
George E. Pataki and his administration, and also pursued by other politicians.
The governor, three successive New York City mayors, and leaders of the Legislature have all contributed to placing more of the system's financial burden on riders, and all approved the capital program.
But Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has the greatest sway over the authority, and the state plays the biggest role in supporting the system.

The governor's appointees hold 6 of the 14 votes on the authority's board, and he chooses the chairman, who sets policy directions and names the top executives.
The mayor's appointees hold four votes, and people chosen by suburban county executives hold the remaining four.

"This is primarily about the governor's role," said Peter Derrick, a former chief of long-range planning at the authority.
"The governor controls the M.T.A., and he's opposed to new taxes and subsidies for transit."
But Adam Barsky, deputy secretary to Mr. Pataki and his main liaison to the authority, disputed the notion that the governor could dictate to the agency or be held responsible for its actions.

Mr. Barsky defended the 2000 capital plan, saying that while "people were aware that there were going to be debt service costs," the current troubles have more to do with unexpected rises in the cost of pensions, health care expenses and labor contracts.
Both he and Mr. Pataki suggested that they did not accept the view that the situation is dire and that higher fares are inevitable.
Officials have proposed an increase next year in what passengers pay by about 5 percent over all, leaving the base fare at $2, raising the cost of the seven-day pass to $24 from $21 and the cost of a 30-day pass to at least $76, and possibly $84, from the current $70.

In an appearance last week in Yonkers, Mr. Pataki said, "We're going to continue to push the M.T.A.
to look at innovative ways to try to avoid having to raise any fares."
When it comes to the authority, politicians have wanted to keep the system in good condition, buy new trains and buses and add expensive new projects, all without a new source of income like higher fares or new taxes.

The authority's administrators have accepted those goals, and in a sense, they achieved them; the system is, by many measures, in better shape and more efficient than ever.
But they also deferred costs through borrowing and put mounting financial burdens on riders.

In 1997, the authority introduced MetroCard discounts, like free transfers between buses and subways, and weekly and monthly passes.
Even after last year's fare increase, authority officials say, riders pay an average of $1.24 a ride, less than in the early 90's.
"It's outrageous that they would invest in new projects without first meeting the need to maintain the assets that are already there," said Richard Ravitch, a former chairman of the authority.

"There's been a conscious retreat, especially by the state, from government's role of putting new resources into mass transit," said Al Appleton, senior fellow for infrastructure at the Regional Plan Association.
In the past four years, the system's pension and health care costs have, indeed, risen more sharply than expected.
But the record low interest rates of recent years -- not anticipated by anyone in 2000 -- greatly lowered the cost of refinancing old debts and borrowing more.

And some dedicated taxes that feed the authority -- taxes on new mortgages and petroleum product sales -- have generated hundreds of millions of dollars more each year than expected.
Looking ahead, though, Mr. Kalikow, who became chairman in 2001, and Ms. Lapp, who joined the agency in 2002, paint a bleak picture.
Their financial plan does not even cover operating expenses after next year, to say nothing of capital costs.

A new five-year capital program is supposed to start next year, but agency officials say they cannot pay for it.
They say they need $17.2 billion just to keep the existing system in good order, $500 million for better security and $7.8 billion to continue the expansion projects -- a total of $25.5 billion.
Their plan calls for $8.7 billion from federal aid, $4 billion in still more debt for the authority and $1.4 billion from steps like selling real estate and advertising.
Ms. Lapp said that "all of those figures may be overly optimistic," as outside monitors have charged.
Even if those estimates are realistic, they leave an $11.4 billion hole to fill.
Unless state and local governments produce the money, Mr. Kalikow and Ms. Lapp have warned, the expansion projects -- the Long Island Rail Road connection, the Second Avenue subway, and a link from Kennedy International Airport to Lower Manhattan -- may have to be sacrificed.
"It's all about whether you can make mass transit pay for itself," said Mr. Derrick, the authority's former planning chief.
"You can make that decision, and the fare will be $4 and fewer people will ride.
But we need to be honest that that's what we're talking about."

With oil prices surging to $55 a barrel from $30 last summer, economists have already reduced their forecasts for economic growth, and sustained high prices could lead to more painful jolts.
Mr. Bush was able to soften the last downturn by pushing through tax cuts totaling $1.9 trillion over 10 years.
But with the federal budget deficit hitting $415 billion this year, and foreign investors increasingly jittery about America's debt to the rest of the world, the next president will have little ability to cut taxes even more.

Nor can the next president expect much help from the Federal Reserve, which fueled consumer spending by cutting interest rates 13 times from early 2001 to June 2003.
Worried about provoking a new round of inflation, the Fed is now increasing rates gradually and is expected to keep raising them for at least the next year.
The combined impact of tax cuts and cheap money has contributed to what Ethan Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, called the "supersizing" of American lifestyles.

"Rising living standards are not a new phenomenon," Mr. Harris noted.
"What's different about this period is that the rise in spending is being financed by lower savings and higher borrowing."

The fragility of the recovery is apparent here in Pennsylvania, a political swing state that has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs over the last four years.
Job creation has picked up noticeably over the last year, with statewide employment climbing by 147,000 jobs in the 12 months through September.
But that still leaves the state with 71,200 fewer jobs than it had in March 2001, when the recession officially began, and the adult population has climbed during that period.
In York, an area with manufacturing and service companies, the unemployment rate is comparatively low at 4.4 percent and even a few factories have begun to rehire workers.
"We could find jobs for 400 people right now," said Michael Smeltzer, director of the Manufacturers' Association of South Central Pennsylvania.

For Beijing, the interest rate increase is a historic embrace of free-market tools of economic management despite possible internal political repercussions, said Tao Dong, the China economist at Credit Suisse First Boston's office here.

Indebted property developers and laid-off workers are likely to be among the angriest.

Higher interest rates could also cause some hiccups for American companies with large beachheads in China, like General Motors.

The Peoples Bank also ended years of regulations tightly limiting the maximum interest rates that banks could charge on loans.
Similar businesses in other countries can attract loans by agreeing to pay higher rates of interest.

Steeply rising prices and low, government-mandated interest rates have prompted companies across China to borrow heavily over the last two years, feeding an extraordinary economic boom.
The borrowers have erected forests of apartment buildings and many new factories, expecting that prices will go up fast enough to ease the cost of repaying the loans.
"On the borrowing side, if the interest rate is 5.3 percent, then take as much as you can get, because the real rate is minus 4 percent," said Nicholas Lardy, a Chinese banking expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, in a telephone interview a few hours before the official announcement.

Many macroeconomic models suggest that when a country becomes the biggest buyer of a commodity, a position that China now holds in goods from cement to steel, its domestic economic policies, including taxes and interest rates, can be used to push prices up or down, to its own benefit or detriment.

China's low interest rates and breakneck growth have caused it to buy so much of so many commodities lately that it has driven their prices steeply higher, forcing Chinese companies to pay top dollar to their own detriment and to the benefit of exporters elsewhere.

With a war under way, and with major differences between the two candidates over tax and other economic policies, it is very possible that a delay this year would be even worse for the markets than it was in 2000.
Martin S. Fridson, publisher of Leverage World, an independent research service in the high-yield market, has reviewed the performance of the markets in 2000 and says he believes that delayed results would again lead to a stock market decline.
He acknowledges that with interest rates as low as they are now, the Treasury market may not rally as much as it did in 2000.

As for high-yield or junk bonds -- his specialty -- the bet is more complicated, in part because such bonds have characteristics of both bonds and stocks.
He argues that with Treasury yields falling, the high-yield market should suffer only a little this time, compared with its performance in 2000.
"For someone who really wants to speculate on this, the play is Treasuries versus stocks," he said.
Sophisticated investors could bet on a rise in bond prices, for example, by buying Treasury futures and could bet on a fall in stocks by selling S.&P.
futures.
That type of bet is best suited to hedge fund and other institutional investors who have a lot of spare cash and are accustomed to going in and out of the futures or options markets.

If there is no delay in the election outcome, investors could lose the thousands of dollars in fees they used to buy the futures or options.

This fervid, otherworldly production by Stacy Klein's Double Edge Theater company, now making its New York debut at La MaMa Annex (the company is based on a farm in Ashfield, Mass.
), is a series of masterfully juggled off-kilter skits that bring the life of the imagination to the stage.
Don't be misled by the title: the show has nothing to do with Dostoevsky's "Possessed" or with Witold Gombrowicz's "Possessed," both of which often appear in the theater.
(A retelling of Gombrowicz's tale opens next week at the Ohio Theater in SoHo, with the Pig Iron Theater troupe's "Hell Meets Henry Halfway.")
"The Unpossessed" is a theater tribute to Cervantes's "Don Quixote," which itself was conceived 400 years ago as a collection of skits lampooning the popular chivalric ballads of that era.
Ms. Klein creates indelible images.
As the play opens, two actors, doubling as props, tower 15 feet above the stage, standing atop rolling ladders whose metal rungs are hidden beneath billowing skirts.
The actors slowly wheel their extended arms, which hold long flags.
The eye gradually makes sense of the scene: they are human windmills.
On the floor between them lies a pile of books representing the heap of romances that fed Don Quixote's delirium.
Sancho Panza (Matthew Glassman) hovers above the books, clinging to a sash hanging from the ceiling.
As a voice cries out, "Sancho!," a hand rises from the books, startling the audience.
The hand is followed by the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance himself (Carlos Uriona), who emerges, grey-bearded, demented and inspired, scattering the fictions.

The spell cast by this opening scene lasts throughout the hour that follows.
Signal episodes from Cervantes's epic are recreated by six performers, who change personas, walk on stilts, swing above the audience on silken sashes, stage a shadow puppet play and roll across the stage in cow troughs (a circular metal frame that is filled with hay on farms, used here to heighten the vertiginous mood).

If there is a familiar image that might help to understand the effect of this visual poetry, it is the scene in Fellini's "Strada" in which Gelsomina, wandering the streets of a grubby village, stands transfixed, watching a man in wings walk above the crowd on a tightrope, without a net.
But Ms. Klein doesn't count Fellini among her influences; she is a disciple of the Polish director Jerzy Grotowski, and means to blend his unreined trope-hopping with the acrobatic spectacle of South American street theater.
Poetic, bathetic, punning and perverse, her show is a rough jumble of wonderment.
Cervantes's goal with "Don Quixote" was to mock idealism for its futility, while at the same time creating a monument to it; that is also the goal of this production.
I'm exasperated at the Bush communications strategy.
They decided not to be open on how they make decisions.
They would never admit mistakes.
They would not fully engage with Washington or even with Republicans on Capitol Hill.
In so doing, they pushed away many who could have helped them -- most important, pro-war Democrats.
They fed the misconception that this is an administration that does not deliberate.

I'm angry at the decision not to send enough troops into Iraq.
The history of the 1990's suggested that when societies are transformed, establishing law and order is the most important thing.
People from the center to the right were screaming for more boots on the ground, but the administration never performed the elementary task of statecraft: matching the tools at your disposal to the goals you hope to pursue.
There are moments when I think, These are exactly the sorts of mistakes that administrations should be thrown out of office for.
Then other considerations come into play.
The first is Kerry.
He's been attacked for being a flip-flopper, but his core trait is that he is monumentally selfish.
Since joining the Senate, he has never attached himself to an idea or movement larger than his own career advancement.

That passive approach was tolerable in the face of a dying Soviet Union.

Third, Kerry's Democrats seem to have no interest in reforming the entitlement programs that are asphyxiating government.
Kerry merely promises to expand the status quo, thus punting on the central domestic challenge of our time.
I'm not allowed to tell you how I'm going to resolve these contradictory impulses (Times policy).
But if Kerry wins, I hope he'll pick three things he wants to do -- for the country, not himself -- and stick with them.
And if Bush is re-elected, I hope he will see his win not as vindication, but as a second chance to act effectively on the visions that inspired hope in the first place.

More retailers are rushing to take advantage of what has become a $17 billion market for room furnishings meant to appeal directly to young people from third grade through high school.
It is a market, said Michael Wood, a vice president at Teenage Research Unlimited, that has "really exploded in the last two years."

And instead of leaving furnishing decisions to their parents, older teenagers and their 8- to 14-year-old sisters and brothers -- called tweens by retailers -- are proud, insistent even, about making those decisions themselves.
Last year, teenagers and tweens spent an average of $386 to decorate their rooms -- more than double the figure of a decade ago, according to the Wonder Group, a youth-marketing company in Cincinnati.
Merchants are responding.
Besides Dry Ice, a $30 million private company that started on a mall cart and has grown to 40 stores from 7 in the last three years, this market is full of start-ups, some more successful than others.

"When I was a kid, I slept in a room with my two brothers," said Steve Thomas, the chief executive at Dry Ice.
Now children usually have rooms to themselves -- the American house is 50 percent bigger than it was in 1970 -- and they control much more of what is bought.
Brandon, who describes his room as "cool," said he just traded in his twin bed.

Ms. Joyce said that teenagers and their tween siblings often have starkly differing tastes.
"A 17-year-old girl might want ruffles and canopies," she said, while "the 13- and 14-year-olds tend to want platform beds, very modern, very sleek."

The interest in decorating now starts well before adolescence.
It was her ninth visit to Dry Ice, which sells things like bed canopies and bulletin boards -- all for the school-age set.
Not far away, two 16-year-old girls, canvassing the mall without their parents, spun on two glossy-metallic diner stools.
"There's a definite switch from Pottery Barn Kids, where Mom makes the choices, with maybe a little input," Mr. Wynhoff of PBTeen said.
Next year, he said, PBTeen plans to introduce an "item of their dreams" feature, which will allow kids to lobby for their deepest desires by making a list of chores they will do to earn money to pay for what they want -- or the movies and candy they will forgo.

Claire's, a jewelry and accessories chain for girls 7 to 17, is starting to expand its Claire's Club, until recently a room accessories section inside its regular stores.
Within the last two weeks, the 1,700-store chain, starting at the Mall of America outside Minneapolis, opened its first three freestanding Claire's Club boutiques.
Recently introduced items include foldable stools, cellphone holders for the desk and "dream nets" to serve as canopies surrounding the bed.
This kind of "soft" home furnishings business -- versus furniture -- is thriving, said a Claire's spokeswoman.
But Claire's is moving cautiously; Charlotte Russe, another tween-oriented chain, tried to do something similar with Charlotte's Room, but halted the experiment last year, after the young constituency failed to buy.

The challenge ahead can be seen in the fiscal decline that took place between Mr. Bush's first inauguration in 2001 and his second one on Jan. 20, 2005.

The ballooning budget deficits, which could total $5 trillion over the next 10 years if Mr. Bush succeeds in making his tax cuts permanent, could constrain the president's choices far more than they have in the first term.
Foreign investors have thus far been willing to finance the United States' borrowing, but most of that has come from central banks of Asian nations rather than private investors.
If foreign appetite for Treasury securities wanes, interest rates would have to rise to make such investments attractive enough to keep money flowing into this country.
"The U.S. bond markets are likely to react very badly," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, an economic forecasting company, "as investors begin to worry about the impact of these large deficits on U.S. interest rates, the U.S. current account deficit and the dollar."

Making the job more difficult, politically as well as economically, is that higher oil prices have slowed American growth even as job creation continues to languish.
Consumer and business confidence have slipped markedly in the last few months.
And while oil prices declined modestly over several days until a $1.26-a-barrel rise on Wednesday, most forecasters are expecting economic growth to slow to 3 percent in 2005 from about 4 percent this year.

Slower growth would aggravate Mr. Bush's budget problems.
The war in Iraq and the continued occupation of Afghanistan could exceed $100 billion next year, according to a Republican analyst.
None of that has been included in an administration plan for reducing the budget deficit by half over five years.

Mr. Bush has also promised to make his tax cuts permanent, which would add nearly $1 trillion to federal debt by 2014.
And to avoid a huge tax increase for the upper middle class, he hopes to re-engineer the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax that was created to prevent wealthy people from overusing tax deductions but that is expected to engulf as many as 30 million families by the end of this decade.
That could cost more than $500 billion.

The biggest problem of all is the one that begins at the end of this decade: the looming retirement of 76 million baby boomers, which is expected to add trillions of dollars in new costs for Social Security and Medicare benefits.
Budget analysts say Mr. Bush can no longer blame slower economic growth or a weak stock market for the budget deficit, as he has in much of his first term, and he cannot count on faster economic growth to close the gap over the next four years.
"Policy choices will determine where we go," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
"We will not grow our way out of this.
It is no longer the case that we can blame everything on the economy."
But even though Republicans have now expanded their control over both houses of Congress, Mr. Bush is likely to face bruising new conflicts as soon as lawmakers return for a lame-duck session to pass spending bills for the coming year.

He has threatened to veto a three-year bill for highways and mass transportation, which would spend tens of billions more than he wants.
Meanwhile, to save money, Republican lawmakers have pared back a number of Mr. Bush's proposals for higher spending on favored programs like space exploration and foreign development assistance.
Mr. Bush could face his first test this month, when Congress tries to pass spending bills covering most areas outside the military and homeland security.
The Senate proposals would run $8 billion higher than the House bills, and they include some of Mr. Bush's priorities in education.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

William Gale and Peter Orszag, budget analysts at the Brookings Institution, estimated that budget deficits would remain at today's levels -- equivalent to roughly 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product -- for the next 10 years if Mr. Bush's tax cuts are extended and if Congress extends other tax cuts that have generally been renewed in the past.
And that does not count the $500 billion for repairing the alternative minimum tax.
Mr. Bush ordered the Treasury to come up with a comprehensive solution by early next year, and that proposal could form the basis of a broader plan to overhaul the income-tax system.
Even if the costs of repairing the tax are submerged in a larger plan, they will be difficult to avoid.
More ominiously, said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, who worked in the Bush White House before becoming head of the Congressional Budget Office, there is little room for error.
Almost any unexpected shock -- a new recession, or a new military crisis -- could push budget shortages higher than the gloomiest forecasters are predicting now.

And even if Washington gets through the current uncertainties, only four years remain until the oldest baby boomers start to retire and the costs of Social Security and Medicare benefits gradually eclipse those of every other part of the federal government.

Weston, the team's home, is an upscale suburb west of Fort Lauderdale, almost to the Everglades.
It's an amalgamation of gated communities and golf courses.
Orange tile roofs protect the houses of professional athletes, corporate vice presidents and their families.
Weston has so many families with so many soccer-playing kids -- nearly 2,500 boys and girls are registered with the league -- that on Saturdays the complex's 16 fields hold back-to-back games for 12 hours.
The Bass are playing on Field 6A, wearing their customary blue uniforms.
Their opponents, the Seadragons, wear red.
When the ball is blown into play, the players on both teams follow it around as iron filings would trail a magnet.
Small bodies collide and separate like electrons as the ball scoots randomly up and down the field.
"Go with it, Colin, go upfield.
There you go, Colin," Bill MacFalls, a coach, says almost under his breath.
Today, he has been asked to limit his instruction to simple positioning.
He quietly calls out to another player, who is gazing at the green hedges that ring the complex's wide field.
The player never notices as a Seadragon wobbles past him to put the ball in the net.

Science fairs and piano recitals feature cultures of quiet respect, says Jim Thompson, the director of the Positive Coaching Alliance, a youth sports research center at Stanford.
In contrast, the raucous culture of professional sports has drifted down to the youth level, he says.

Mr. Thompson works with some 400 youth leagues around the country.
He is not totally sold on the Silent Saturday concept.

"I just think it's not the most effective way," Mr. Thompson says of Silent Saturdays.
"I think it's effective for that particular day: parents are quiet, kids do enjoy themselves more than when there's yelling, but it doesn't teach parents the kind of things we want them to know."

Silent Saturday came to Weston by way of Richard Schwartz, the league's director.

"There's got to be a safe zone," Mr. Schwartz says, standing under a canopy at the soccer complex, where he is handing out "I Support Silent Saturday" T-shirts.

That's the lowest one-year pace on record -- and it lags behind inflation, which clocked in at 2.7 percent.
It's nice to see consumption up.
But these numbers show it's being fueled by borrowing, not fatter paychecks, and that is worrisome.
After a long period of sluggishness, the economy added a healthy 377,000 jobs in October, but it will take sustained monthly increases of similar size before anyone can say with confidence that hiring is truly on the rebound.
Home values are still rising in some markets, but who knows how long that will last.
Meanwhile, household debt keeps increasing, with 40 percent of all new mortgages at variable rates, and homeowners and renters alike using more of their income to pay their credit card bills.
So the outlook is for an economy that slogs along at a decent pace -- unless the debt load becomes unbearable.
No one knows if or when accumulated debt could become unsustainable.
But after years of encouraging borrowing with rock-bottom interest rates, policy makers should at least admit the possibility of a debilitating crunch -- and act accordingly.
That would involve seeing a relationship between private and public debt.
The more indebted the nation is, the greater the danger of spikes in interest rates.
To alleviate that danger, it's imperative to increase the nation's savings rate.
There is simply no proven policy to increase private savings.
So the government has to increase the national savings rate by saving money through deficit reduction.
Warning about debt levels is the economic equivalent of crying wolf.
Americans are familiar with debt hangovers and always seem to recover.
But the cure is seldom painless: a family may have to do without, or the government may raise taxes and cut spending.
Still, with the political will to tackle deficits, the pain yet to come can be mitigated.
Or, we can look at it statistically.
About 77 million baby boomers are racing toward retirement.
That's people roughly between 40 and 60 years old.
More than 34 percent of the ones over 55 report having financial savings (not counting their home equity) of less than $50,000.
Only 21 percent have more than $100,000.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We can look at it another way.
If you had to retire in 10 years with (now let's be really generous here) twice the savings you now have, and would receive interest of 4 percent on it, how close would you be to having a living income, i.e.
an income you could live on at your present style of life?
Be honest.
You can look at it still another way.
The average family in the New York area earns roughly (and I mean really roughly) $50,000 a year.
You would need to have at least $1.25 million in principal to yield that income at 4 percent.
Do you have it?
Or, let's look at it yet another way: you're a successful lawyer or executive living on $500,000 a year.
A lot of people within the sound of my voice are at that level.
To sustain that level of income at 4 percent, you will need about $12.5 million in principal.
Are you even remotely close?
Counting your pension and Social Security, are you even close?
Are you even halfway there?
If not, what are you going to do?

This is the bore of the gun pointed right between the eyes of the baby boomers.

By the way, all of my numbers assume you do not want to consume your capital, and believe me, you don't.
If you are a woman who retires at 65, you have a better than even chance of living to 85.
If you are a man, your chances are still better than 4 in 10.
In that 20 years, prices could easily double.
You want to be adding to your savings in retirement, not depleting them.
For a couple who reach 65, there is a 45 percent chance that one partner will live to 90.

What's the solution?
Major league retirement planning right here and now.
Right this second.
Make a plan with an adviser you trust and for whom you have gotten superb references.
Make it a plan with a lot of diversification of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, foreign, domestic, emerging, variable annuities (but study them carefully -- there are immense variations among them), real estate and even cash.

The plan has to allow for expensive, long-term medical care.
It has to provide for the possibility of losing your job at some point before you reach retirement age.
The plan cannot count on miracle cures from the federal government.
The federal government is just a means of transferring money from wage earners to retirees -- and the wage earners are not going to want to bankrupt themselves for the baby boomers (who got all of the good music anyway).
There is a great Chinese proverb: no money, no life.
It applies in spades to older people.
In a free society we all make our own reality, and (as I am fond of saying) we can make a reality where we are secure or a reality where we are in terror.
It's up to us, and the time to start is right now.
Even if you are far behind, start now.
Even if it takes sacrifice, start now.
The alternative, poverty in old age, is just too grim to contemplate.
There are no magic bullets.
It is up to you.

After two hours of steady pounding by American guns, tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles and AC-130 gunships, at least one objective -- a hospital about half a mile west of downtown Falluja -- was secured by American Special Forces and the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion.
Shortly before midnight, American forces were exchanging gunfire across a bridge near the hospital with several insurgent positions on the other side.
"There has been extensive gunfire going across the river," said the American commander of the Special Forces operation at the hospital.
"Bradleys have been shooting over to the east of us, and there has been extensive machine gun fire to the southwest of us."
As that firefight raged, extensive airstrikes and artillery fire pummeled the northern and western sections of Falluja, with great blossoms of flame brightening and then fading with each boom of the heavy cannons on the AC-130 gunships, circling over the city like birds of prey.

A huge fire burned in the midst of the city.
The streets themselves, as seen through the powerful night-vision equipment aboard one Bradley fighting vehicle southeast of Falluja, appeared eerily deserted.

Before American jets began their bombing on Monday morning, American troops in front of the hospital took intense fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades from insurgents across the river.

This time around, the American military intends to fight its own information war, countering or squelching what has been one of the insurgents' most potent weapons.
The military hopes that if it can hold its own in that war, then the armed invasion -- involving as many as 25,000 American and Iraqi troops, all told -- will smash what has become the largest remaining insurgent stronghold in Iraq.

And with only three months to go until the country's first democratic elections, American and Iraqi officials are grasping for any tool at their command to bring the insurgency under control.
A day earlier, insurgents carried out coordinated bomb and mortar attacks in Samarra and the surrounding area, killing at least 30 people, many of them Iraqi policemen.

Samarra's slip back into chaos raised serious doubts about whether the Iraqi government can maintain order in Falluja should an American-led offensive kill or drive out most of the insurgents here.

Dr. Allawi said he would give more details on his declaration of emergency law at a news conference scheduled for Monday.
"We declared it today, and we are going to implement it whenever and wherever it is necessary," he told reporters on Sunday inside the fortified compound that houses the headquarters of the interim Iraqi government.
"This will send a very powerful message that we are serious."
Once Dr. Allawi's intentions become clear, American-led forces will be deployed to help enforce the law, a senior American military official said in Baghdad on Sunday.
That could include operating more checkpoints and increasing patrols across the country, all with an eye toward the elections in January.

"We want elections to take place," Dr. Allawi said.
"We want to secure the country so elections can be done in a peaceful way and the Iraqi people can participate in the elections freely, without the intimidation by terrorists and by forces who are trying to wreck the political process in Iraq."

Though Dr. Allawi has tried hard to cast himself as a strongman since taking office, Iraqi confidence in the interim government has plummeted as the insurgency has become stronger and deadlier.

Earlier Sunday at the makeshift base where American forces have been encamped just outside Falluja, the air was thick with anticipation as the initial stage of the invasion approached.
More than 2,000 marines gathered to hear a last-minute pep talk from their commanders, including Lt. Gen. John F. Sattler, the top Marine commander in Iraq.
"This town is held by mugs, thugs, murderers and intimidators," General Sattler said.
"All they need is for us to break the back of the intimidation," he said, referring to the Iraqis who are to join the attack.
"Those security forces need you beside them.
They need you to motivate them.
Once they have the inspiration, they will take care of the mission themselves."

Once American forces enter Falluja proper, they are likely to face a host of unpredictable dangers, including booby-trapped buildings and suicide bombers, military officials said.

The glacier, named Zepu, has lost more than 100 yards of thickness, all in the last three decades, largely because of rising temperatures in the region.
And it is hardly unique.
Working with scientists from Ohio State University, Dr. Yao has documented similar losses all over Tibet, the largest and loftiest highlands on earth, and home to the biggest concentration of alpine glaciers anywhere.
Nor are these changes limited to Tibet.
"Make no mistake, what's happening to the glaciers in Tibet is happening around the globe," said Dr. Lonnie G. Thompson, a professor of geological science at Ohio State.
"Our measurements show that between 1850 and 1960, the glaciers retreated 7.5 percent.
"In the 1990's alone, the glaciers have shrunk by more than 4 percent."
Dr. Peter Clark, an Oregon State University geologist who specializes in glaciers and ice ages, agreed.

"Glacial retreat, which is happening globally, with the exception of one area, in Scandinavia, is a pretty widely understood and accepted phenomenon," he said.
"Glaciers advance and retreat in response to two things, precipitation and temperature.
Certainly by the standards of the last few thousand years, there has been a marked rise in temperature globally."

Dr. Thompson said he had documented large puddles of melting ice at 20,000 feet in the Himalayas, where for thousands of years all has been frozen.
A craggy 56-year-old who says he has spent at least three years of his life at elevations of 18,000 feet or more researching glaciers, he spoke during a recent interview in Beijing.

The essence of his work involves retrieving deep ice samples, or cores, from glaciers.
He spends much of his year like a migratory bird, traveling from one glacial mass to another, including the Himalayas and mountains in Peru, Kenya and Alaska.

"When we go to retrieve a core, it's usually to a place that no one has ever been, and the beauty of ice, which is really different from any other material, is how much you can learn from it," he said.
"It tells you the history of precipitation, of dust accumulation and of wind strength.
It also gives you a history of the atmosphere, including the presence of sulfates, nitrates and chlorides, which are precisely the factors associated with global warming."

"When you see the big picture accumulating from many sites, the evidence of drastic climate change becomes quite compelling," Dr. Thompson said.
Climate experts and geologists say the consequences of glacial ice melting on this scale are far-reaching.
The most important long-term threat, perhaps, is to the low-lying coastal cities around the world -- places like New York and New Orleans, or Tokyo and Shanghai -- which could see more frequent flooding as a result of rising sea levels in this century.

In other parts of the Himalayas, large newborn lakes are accumulating behind dams of ice that could break, unleashing deadly flash floods.
For his part, Dr. Yao is unwilling to make sweeping predictions.
Instead, fixing his gaze on the leading edge of the fast-melting Zepu glacier, he said, "If you come back here in another 30 years, one thing is for sure: There will definitely be no more ice here."
Correction: November 20, 2004, Saturday An article in Science Times on Nov. 9 about the effects of global warming on glaciers and ice-capped mountains misstated the location of Kilimanjaro, where the ice cap has shrunk to less than a square mile from 4.3 square miles in 1912.

At the same time, the emphasis on low inflation pressures indicated that officials thought they could take their time if, as many forecasters predict, economic growth slows sharply next year.
"It's ambiguous enough that it can be spun in any direction to support your view," said Robert DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup.
By historical standards, interest rates are still far below normal levels.

Businesses "modestly increased" capital spending and hiring, the Fed said, and "businesses in most districts continued to express concern over the rising cost of energy and other inputs."
The biggest uncertainties, aside from the possibility of a terrorist attack, are about the huge United States trade deficit and the prospects for a significant fall in the value of the dollar.

The trade deficit narrowed slightly in September, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday, but the deficit has widened by about 25 percent over the last year and is expected to widen further in the months ahead as a result of high oil prices.
Higher trade deficits subtract from domestic economic growth, and they have also led to a staggering increase in the United States' overall indebtedness to the rest of the world, which is now ballooning by more than $600 billion a year.
At the same time, he predicted, consumer spending will be restrained as stimulus from President Bush's tax cuts declines and as people cling more tightly to their pocketbooks.

"The Fed is in a tough spot," said Peter Morici, professor of economics at the University of Maryland.

Fed officials are more sanguine, with Mr. Greenspan still predicting that the economy simply entered a temporary "soft patch" this summer.
Fed officials also feel they have room to maneuver, because inflation remains very low.
The Fed's unofficial rule is that inflation, excluding volatile sectors like food and energy, should not increase more than about 2 percent a year.
The Consumer Price Index, excluding food and energy, is up about 2 percent this year.
But the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the Commerce Department's deflator for personal consumer expenditures, shows the core rate of inflation at 1.5 percent.
That consumers will borrow and repay is a welcome switch for Southeast Asia's banks after the untrammeled corporate lending that devastated them in the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998.

But the region's banks are playing catch-up with aggressive foreign institutions like Citibank, G.E.
and Aeon of Japan, which pioneered consumer finance in Southeast Asia after witnessing the markets take off in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.
By offering the long-neglected Southeast Asian consumer convenient loans, economists say, these lenders are helping to stimulate domestic consumption that can offset the region's dependence on exports, which ebb and flow.
This may seem to contradict conventional wisdom, which holds that Asians are prolific savers, averse to debt.
Bankers say the growth of consumer finance is proving convention wrong.
"It's a myth," said David Lum, regional head of banking at Daiwa Institute of Research in Singapore.

During hard times, Southeast Asians used to turn to informal financing networks among relatives, their villages or loan sharks.
At the time, the region's own banks neglected consumers to focus on channeling the public's savings into corporate manufacturing and roads, bridges, steel mills, refineries and the like.

What GE Capital's executives from Thailand impressed on Mr. Welch was this: despite low incomes, Asian consumers are excellent credit risks, even with interest rates much higher than corporations pay.
That is because even relatively small loans -- for a car or motorcycle -- represent critical personal investments.

"Our competitor here is cash," said David Skillen, the regional head of Citibank's credit card business in Singapore.
And making money in consumer finance requires lots of loans since low per-capita incomes mean that most consumers can borrow only small amounts.
In Thailand, for example, GE Capital and others started out issuing cards to customers earning as little as $2,100 a year.

So, in addition to the usual fliers and sign-up prizes that card issuers offer, Citibank tailored new marketing tactics to the local audience.
Familiar to Americans as layaway plans, hire-purchase agreements allow customers to pay for a television, personal computer or bedroom suite in installments.
The customer simply fills out the paperwork at the store, which can then get instant approval from a consumer finance company.
Citibank and other card issuers give customers hire-purchase options, but with a twist.
Customers can use their cards to pay for anything from college tuition to a new car to a mobile phone, and can then designate that those items be separated from their main credit balance and paid off instead in regular installments.

In Thailand, the growth of consumer finance has played into Mr. Thaksin's longstanding efforts to stimulate domestic demand by offering easy credit to city residents and promoting financing to farmers and small and medium-size enterprises.

Spending on each of those cards is growing at roughly 27 percent a year.

Similar growth rates are evident around the region.
At the same time, the region has had no real credit bureaus to keep track of customers who get in over their heads.

Industry data indicates that Thais may not need such safeguards.
Executives like Mr. Chamikorn complain that restrictions on lending to consumers deprive credit to poorer Thais, forcing them to turn to loan sharks.
Capital OK started offering personal loans in August, with the goal of lending 1.6 billion baht ($39 million) this year.
Mr. Chamikorn predicted that Capital OK's parentage could give it a leg up on rivals in Thailand's increasingly competitive market.

Shin also owns half of a Thai discount airline, which will eventually team up with Capital OK to offer its own credit card.

For all its professed desire for a strong dollar, the Bush administration has apparently decided that letting the dollar slide is a good way to shrink America's trade deficit.
This is dubious economic policy.
It provides a modicum of relief to American exporters, but it increases the nation's vulnerability to higher prices and higher interest rates, while ignoring fiscal measures that would more assuredly anchor the United States in the global economy.
The decline has not been as marked against other currencies, largely because China and Japan prop up the dollar by investing heavily in United States Treasury securities -- in effect, lending us money so we can buy their goods.
Meanwhile, the Treasury secretary, John Snow, has largely eliminated the phrase "strong dollar" from his workaday vocabulary.
The underlying problem is that deficits in America's global transactions are at record levels, putting Americans at risk of either a slow deterioration in living standards or abrupt spikes in inflation and interest rates.
There are three ways to get that deficit down: America can reduce the federal budget deficit, thus lowering the amount of interest we pay foreign countries to finance that deficit; trading partners like Europe and Japan can expand their economies, increasing their demand for American goods; or America can allow its dollar to fall to increase its exports.
The only lasting remedy is to reduce the federal budget deficit.
That, in turn, calls for specific policies, like -- we may have mentioned this before -- rolling back the Bush tax cuts.
Letting the dollar weaken is a far less responsible approach, an unwieldy and risky attempt to reduce the trade imbalance without the political pain of deficit reduction.

During the Bush years, 92 percent of the nearly $1 trillion increase in publicly held debt has been financed by foreign lenders.
Foreign ownership of Treasuries has tripled from the peak of the Reagan deficits in 1983.
Because of this enormous dependency, anything that might affect foreign lenders' willingness to invest in Treasuries -- including dismay over the United States' long-term fiscal disarray, better investment opportunities elsewhere, or geopolitical or economic strife -- could cause the dollar to tank.

No one knows if or when that would actually happen, though the dollar's slide since the election doesn't inspire confidence.
But we do know that financial flows are quick and unsentimental.
A fiscal policy that esteems controlling the deficit over tax cuts is the best way to avoid a debilitating dollar decline.
There is truth to the complaint that countries in Europe and elsewhere are not doing enough to bolster consumption within their own economies.

Instead of complaining, Washington should get its own affairs in order.
Investment theme parties have a way of fizzling, however, and investing in dividend payers may be no different.
A steep climb in interest rates, for example, would improve the returns on competing investments like certificates of deposit and money market funds, shrinking demand for dividend-paying stocks.
If share prices of dividend payers rise faster than their dividends, meanwhile, yields would shrink and the stocks would become less attractive.
And the dividend tax cut is scheduled to expire in 2009, though the Bush administration has indicated that it favors extending it.

For now, at least, dividends are in demand, and investors seem to have moved from simply buying stocks that pay high yields to finding those with a steady history of dividend growth.
Both BlackRock and PowerShares have licensed a method developed by Mergent Inc., a provider of financial information, that identifies and ranks companies that have raised dividends for at least 10 consecutive years.
"Once you have increased dividends for 10 years in a row, there is a high probability of future dividend increases," said Roby Muntoni, director of index operations at Mergent.
Other managers use variations on the dividend growth theme.
Donald G. Taylor, of the Franklin Rising Dividends fund, looks for companies that have raised dividends in at least 8 of the last 10 years.
But he also searches for stocks whose dividends have doubled over the last decade, and for companies whose yearly dividend payout represents less than 65 percent of earnings.
Beyond running those screens, Mr. Taylor looks for companies with low debt and with shares that are currently in the lower half of their historical ranges.
Franklin Rising Dividends has outperformed the S.&P.

One of Mr. Taylor's holdings is Leggett & Platt, which makes components for reclining chairs and other furniture.

Merck's tumble demonstrates that dividend stocks are not without risk, but it also points out the problems of an alternative approach to dividend-centric investing: the Dogs of the Dow theory.
Using this method, investors bet on the 10 stocks in the Dow Jones industrials with the highest yields -- the dividend rate divided by the share price.
Often, the stocks' yields are high because their prices have been beaten down.
From 1973 to 1996, on average, the Dogs of the Dow outperformed the Dow, but more recently they have been less consistent.
This year, even as their fellow dividend payers have rallied, the Dogs have been sound asleep, losing an average of 4.4 percent.

Most analysts said that Ireland's period of runaway inflation was a result of some short-sighted government spending and some inevitable fiscal changes at the introduction of the euro, like rapid exchange rate fluctuations and ceding control of interest rates to the European Central Bank.
But the analysts do not see high prices today as a problem.
Inflation is a "natural element" of Ireland's rapid economic growth, said Austin Hughes, an economist at IIB Bank, a mortgage lender with more than $9 billion in assets.
"It's a consequence rather than a leading indicator," he said.
And given the benefits of Ireland's economic growth in the last decade, "it's probably a cost that we're willing to pay."

But manufacturers are still enjoying an overall drop in labor costs because of productivity increases from long before the boom began, and to recent downsizing.

Ireland remains at nearly full employment, and wages have kept pace -- rising 37.1 percent before tax from 1998 to 2003, and 12.1 percent in real terms that account for inflation.
So, basic necessities have not been put out of reach.
The Competitiveness Council survey found that gross average pay is now 38,140 euros ($48,370) in Ireland, compared with 35,750 euros ($45,339) in Britain and 40,470 euros ($51,325) in the United States.
That has not stopped people from feeling cheated when they see price tags creeping upward every month.
"You have to work to a budget now," said Karen Reilly, 23, a trainee beautician, while buying clothes for her children in shops already glittering with Christmas decorations.
She was conscious of spending more on household bills as well as retail purchases.

Correction: November 20, 2004, Saturday A picture caption in World Business on Tuesday with an article about the sharp increase in prices in Ireland misstated the name of a clothing store in Dublin.

"We are operating now at the high end of the Fed's comfort range," Mr. DeKaser said.
It is unclear, though, how much rising prices will feed into inflation at the consumer level.
To date, intense international competition has made it nearly impossible for most producers to pass on cost increases.

And some analysts observed that the recent decline in oil prices might take pressure off producer prices in coming months.
But that source of restraint might be faltering, as the weaker dollar, by contributing to higher import prices, has reduced some of this competitive pressure on American industries.
"We will be seeing some pass-through into the Consumer Price Index," predicted Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist at Global Insight, a research and analysis firm in Waltham, Mass.

The Fed started gradually ratcheting up interest rates in early summer.
The central bank's benchmark federal funds rate, which determines overnight borrowing rates among banks, is now at 2 percent, up from a low of 1 percent as recently as June.

Throughout the process, the Fed has said it will continue to raise rates in small steps until it reaches a neutral stance -- which market analysts say is somewhere between 3 and 5 percent.
So far, the Fed has remained optimistic about inflation, treating the jump in oil prices as a transitory factor that is not expected to rekindle inflationary forces in other sectors of the economy.
What worries Mr. Paulsen and others, though, is that the combination of a weaker dollar and slowing productivity gains might squeeze businesses hard enough that they will start raising prices on a wider variety of products.

"The Fed is feeling good about its rearview mirror," Mr. Paulsen said.
"But the things that are keeping the Fed calm are eroding as we speak."

"The point is that it appears that it is not the foreign buying of Treasuries that is keeping interest rates low," said William Prophet, an interest rate strategist with UBS.
"The flows just aren't there."
And it means other factors -- including worries about slowing economic growth and surprisingly little concern about a rise in inflation -- seem to account for the unexpectedly low level of interest rates.
Still, the theme that foreign inflows into the Treasury market are an important market mover plays well among traders.

One explanation given for the rally in the Treasury market yesterday was that traders expected rates to fall further because Japan was expected to try to slow the rise of the yen against the dollar by intervening in the foreign exchange market.
The dollars accumulated by selling yen would then be used to buy Treasury securities.
At that time, Japan was spending $14.8 trillion yen -- or about $142 billion at the current exchange rate -- to keep the yen from falling further.

Since that high, the monthly net buying of Treasury notes and bonds has dropped as low as $14.6 billion in August, before rising to $19.2 billion in September.
Still, that $19.2 billion is well below the average for the last 12 months of $31.8 billion.
A look behind the headline numbers that traders see -- the net inflow of $19.2 billion in September -- shows that this inflow may be supporting Treasuries over time less than it might appear.
Of that total, $9 billion came from a category the Treasury calls Caribbean Banking Centers: the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Netherlands Antilles and Panama.

Many traders argue that much of this money is actually from hedge funds rather than from central banks or private investors, whose intentions would be to leave their money in the market for some time.
Rather, hedge fund money can move in and out of the Treasury market very quickly.

Last, there was a net selling of about $3.5 billion of Treasury bills between the end of August and the end of September, according to Treasury data.
Mr. Prophet of UBS said the current low level of interest rates was hard to explain, although fears of slower growth and confidence that inflation is not a threat must be having an impact.
But, he added, "it is somewhat of a mystery, which is why so many people bought into this idea of foreign inflows."
The confidence is also reflected in the stock market.
There, the underlying strength is obscured by the fact that some large stocks have not done as well as the overall market.
This month's rally has left the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 6 percent for 2004, but more than 20 percent below the 2000 peak.

Still, most stocks in the index are well above where they were when the market peaked.
The S.&P.
reflects that by measuring the index in an alternative way -- one that assumes that an investor put an equal amount of money into each stock, rather than buying more shares in larger companies.
On that equal-weighted basis, the index is up 11 percent this year -- and is more than 20 percent above the 2000 peak.
Why the confidence?
Economies are generally performing well, and companies are making enough money that they do not need to borrow much.
Default rates are down in the United States, and in Europe there have been no defaults on high-yield bonds in 2004.
Investors, surprised that long-term interest rates have not risen, have reached for better yields by purchasing more speculative bonds.

The dollar is weak, and the big story of 2005 may be efforts by Europe and the United States to force China and other Asian nations to allow their currencies to rise.
In that atmosphere, one might expect foreigners to shy away from dollar-denominated corporate bonds, fearing that currency losses could more than offset interest income.
But so far that has not been the case.
In the last 12 months, almost $300 billion in foreign money has gone into such securities, 22 percent more than the year before.
The money financing the trade deficit must go somewhere, and foreigners are dubious about American stocks.
A lot goes into Treasuries, but their yields are even lower than corporate bonds'.

Is the lack of worry reasonable, or a sign of dangerous complacency?
The margin for error is obviously greater when there is little in the way of extra compensation for taking on risk.
At the moment, the yield premium on speculative bonds -- whether denominated in dollars, pounds sterling or euros -- is a third or less of what it was just two years ago, according to Lehman Brothers data.
"We are reaching levels that are clearly unsustainable," said Guillaume Menuet, an economist at Moody's in London, speaking of the small yield premiums.
"The question is how fast they will go up."
Taken together, the two speeches appear to be sending an unmistakable message that Washington, on the heels of President Bush's election to a second term, is prepared to tolerate a weaker dollar for the foreseeable future.

A falling dollar makes it more expensive for Americans to travel abroad and risks reviving inflation and sending interest rates higher in the United States.
But for American manufacturers, who have been shedding jobs for years, it provides a powerful shot of adrenaline by making their exports cost less abroad and adding to pressure on foreign industries to raise the price of imported goods in the United States.
Given the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, Mr. Greenspan likened predicting the dollar's path to "forecasting the outcome of a coin toss."
While Mr. Greenspan, as he often does, relied on carefully chosen phrases open to various interpretations, the message seemed clear here to European bankers, who laughed nervously at the metaphor: The dollar, which has fallen to record lows against the euro this week -- giving fits to European politicians and business executives -- is likely to fall even further.

To analysts, the speech had a laissez-faire tone, leaving events in the hands of the market and giving speculators free rein to bet against the American currency without worrying that officials would get together to slap them down.

Currency traders drove the dollar to its lowest level in four and a half years against the Japanese yen, and near its record low against the euro.
The hints from Washington policy makers that they have no intention of supporting the dollar could add to the strains between the United States and Europe, which is increasingly worried that the rise of the euro is choking off its tenuous recovery.
European leaders are already raising distress flags.

Both central bankers later flew to Berlin for a meeting of the G-20, which includes the Group of 8 industrialized countries, as well as emerging economies.
The downward path of the dollar is likely to be high on the agenda, but there is little hope for a concerted response.
Analysts said Mr. Greenspan's speech made it clear that the Federal Reserve would make no effort to influence the process of narrowing the United States' current account deficit, either through interest rate increases aimed at deliberately supporting the dollar or by intervening in the market.

The current account deficit, which encompasses annual trade as well as the balance of financial flows, has gone from zero in 1990 to nearly $600 billion this year.
The nation's accumulated debt to foreign investors is $2.6 trillion, equivalent to 23 percent of the annual output of the economy.
"Either the current account deficit comes down.
Or the market will do it, but at a cost to the dollar.
Will the Fed play a role in this?
Probably not.
It will stick to its mandate."
Speaking on a panel that included the deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, Kazumasa Iwata, Mr. Greenspan devoted most of his remarks to the effect that American fiscal policy has on global markets.

"Current account imbalances, per se, need not be a problem," he said in a characteristically technical speech, "but cumulative deficits, which result in a marked decline of a country's net international position -- as is occurring in the United States -- raise more complicated issues."
Mr. Greenspan said foreign investors, in part because they fear having too much money at risk in the United States, would eventually become reluctant to take on more such assets.

"It seems persuasive that given the size of the U.S. current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point," Mr. Greenspan said.
"But when, through what channels, and from what level of the dollar?
Regrettably, no answer to those questions is convincing."

This is not the first time Mr. Greenspan has warned about the risks of a rapidly widening current-account deficit.
In testimony before Congress last February, he said "foreign investors, both private and official, may become less willing to absorb ever growing claims on U.S.
residents."
That would make more domestic savings available in the United States, reducing the dependence on foreign borrowing.

But analysts did not interpret Mr. Greenspan's remarks as a rebuke of the White House -- which has indicated that it will seek to make the deep tax cuts of its first term permanent -- but rather an effort to let the markets find their course.

So what kind of bird would fit more accurately with our agrarian fantasies?
Well, how about one that spends most of its life outdoors?
Such birds -- called pastured birds -- are able to move around freely.
Instead of having to be injected with antibiotics to stay healthy, they doctor themselves, seeking out certain plants at certain times of the year for pharmacological reasons.
Because they expend so much energy moving around, they also grow more slowly: it takes them a month longer to reach slaughter weight than factory birds, which is one of the reasons pasturing is less attractive to industrial farmers.
Scientific research comparing the health benefits of conventionally raised turkey to pastured turkey is scarce, but some work has been done on chickens.
A study sponsored by the Department of Agriculture in 1999, for example, found that pastured chickens have 21 percent less fat, 30 percent less saturated fat, 50 percent more vitamin A and 400 percent more omega-3 fatty acids than factory-raised birds.
They also have 34 percent less cholesterol.

The pasture principle isn't limited to fowl.
Compared to most American beef, which is raised on a grain-intensive diet, pasture-fed beef offers 400 percent more vitamin A and E. It is also much richer in beta-carotene and conjugated linoleic acids, all of which inhibit cancer.
It's also higher in omega-3 fatty acids, which are a major inhibitor of heart disease.
These benefits don't exist at these levels in animal that are fed an unvaried and unnatural diet.
The pasture principle can be applied to vegetables as well.
We don't live off the food we eat -- we live off the energy in the food we eat.
today we might well ask: "What are our vegetables eating?"
It seems axiomatic but it's worth remembering that in order to experience the health benefits of the roasted broccoli at the Thanksgiving table, that broccoli needs to have been healthy too.
We can be forgiven for ignoring the obvious because most every diet I've seen treats a head of broccoli the way Gertrude Stein talked about a rose -- but a broccoli is not a broccoli is not a broccoli, especially if you consider how and from where its grown.

Sadly, the broccoli and the other brassicas on your holiday table (brussels sprouts, cabbage, turnips, kale, mustard greens) were most likely grown in a monoculture -- a place where, with the help of large amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, nothing but the crop is allowed to grow.
Fertilizers are as pervasive in these large farms as tractors, especially synthetic nitrogen.
And you can understand why: the chemicals bulk up vegetables beautifully and quickly, enabling them to withstand the rigors of long-distance travel so that they can arrive at your supermarket unbruised and brightly colored.
But it's a little like dating someone on steroids: the look and feel may be an initially appealing, but in the end it's all kind of disconcerting.

And think what gets lost.
A serving of broccoli is naturally rich in vitamins A and B, and has more vitamin C than citrus fruit.
But raised in an industrial farm monoculture, shipped over a long distance and stored before and after being delivered to your supermarket, it loses up to 80 percent of its vitamin C and 95 percent of its calcium, iron and potassium.
Fruits and vegetables grown organically, however, have higher levels of antioxidants.
That's largely because a plant's natural defense system produces phenolic compounds, chemicals that act as a plant's defense against pests and bugs.
These compounds are beneficial to our health, too.
When plants are grown with herbicides and pesticides, they slow down their production of these compounds.
(Even more important, from a cook's point of view, organically grown fruits and vegetables taste better -- their flavors practically burst from the ground and demand to be expressed, and we chefs merely comply.)

The same rules apply to the root vegetables, whether potatoes, sunchokes, beets, parsnips or carrots.
Seek out ones grown in nutrient-rich soil for the greatest flavor and benefit.
You can't buy good quality soil in a bag any more than you can buy good nutrition in a pill.
Most organic farmers encourage complex relationships between crop roots, soil microbes and minerals -- relationships that become wholly disrupted by chemical additives.

What about the milk and eggs that go into Thanksgiving pies and tarts?
Not surprisingly, pastured dairy cattle and laying hens produce more nutritious milk and cheese -- pastured eggs in particular, with their glowing yellow yolks, have up to three times the amount of cancer-fighting omega-3's of eggs that come from factory hens.
As a chef, I am often mystified as I hear diners, rooting around for a nutrition and dietary cure, ask for this steamed and that on the side, and in the process deny themselves pleasure.
Choosing what dietary advice of the moment to follow by putting a wet finger up to the wind, our patrons decide, or succumb, en masse, to a pummeling of such wearisome regularity that it begins to resemble the "rosebud" of "Citizen Kane": the clue that solves everything but means nothing.
There is an ecology of eating.
Like any good ecosystem, our diet should be diverse, dynamic and interrelated.
In 1984 Americans were spending roughly 8 percent of their disposable income on health care and about 15 percent on food.
Today, those numbers are essentially reversed.
An ever-more reductionist diet -- protein this year, carbohydrates next year -- ignores plant and animal systems loaded with genetic complexity, and the benefits that complexity passes down to us.
So as you're getting ready for Thanksgiving, think of yourself less as a consumer of the harvest bounty and more, in the words of Carlo Petrini of the Slow Foods movement, as a co-producer.
Try to remember what you know intuitively: that we can't be healthy unless our farms our healthy; that the end of the food chain is connected to the beginning of the food chain; that we can't lose touch with the culture in agriculture (it dates back to before Dr. Atkins).
To the extent possible, shop at farmers markets for your Thanksgiving foods.
Try to choose diversity over the abundance that the big food chains offer.
Your food will be tastier, fresher and more nutritious.
You'll be able to have your cake (and your bacon and your bread and your potatoes) and eat it too.

Op-Ed Contributor Dan Barber is the chef of Blue Hill at Stone Barns and creative director of the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture.
If the Federal Reserve Board were free to manipulate interest rates solely in response to business conditions, it would make sense to stand pat in December, and avoid a rate hike despite recent signs of inflation.
Unfortunately, Alan Greenspan, the chairman, doesn't have that kind of flexibility these days.
Raising interest rates looks like the more prudent route -- even though stagnating wages could really use a little help right now.
A probable December rate increase is noteworthy in and of itself, but even more so for how it highlights the growing divergence in monetary and fiscal policy.
By continuing to raise rates, Mr. Greenspan would be easing off the economic accelerator of rock-bottom rates.
President Bush, meanwhile, plans to go full speed ahead with more tax cuts.
For the Fed and the administration to be at cross-purposes does not bode well for the economy.
The unexpectedly large 0.6 percent inflation spike in October was driven mainly by increases in the costs of oil and food -- which have since abated.
In fact, wage gains have not outpaced inflation in eight of the last 12 months.
Economists generally regard the price of labor as far more important than the cost of commodities when it comes to inflation.
So all things being equal, Mr. Greenspan might choose to hold rates steady to spur hiring.
Alas, all other things are not equal.
As much as the job market might benefit from a pause in rate hikes, Mr. Greenspan is unlikely to take a break.
For one, rates are already very low -- a holdover from the Fed's effort to stimulate economic growth in the last few years.
Mr. Greenspan needs more room to maneuver in the event of a body blow to the economy -- an oil shock, say, or terrorist attack.
The chairman has to get rates up, in case he needs to bring them down.
That is particularly true since the Fed cannot count on other stimuli being available.
Mr. Bush's fiscal policies -- tax cuts, chief among them -- have already busted the federal budget, and the outlook is for more deficit-financed giveaways.
Nor can Mr. Greenspan fall back on a strong dollar.
The weakening dollar, a result of global imbalances that are also traceable, in part, to the budget deficit, increases the pressure for higher rates because it is, in itself, an inflationary force that is gathering steam.
Speaking at an international banking conference in Germany last week, Mr. Greenspan said that foreign investors who are financing America's huge deficits would eventually resist lending more to the United States.
That, in turn, would cause the dollar to fall even further than its recent historic lows, risking an upsurge in American prices and interest rates.
Given the policy bind, the Fed would be justified if it raised rates next month.
That doesn't make a rate hike an unambiguously good policy.
The Fed is being reduced to making the best of a bad situation.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence, after falling for three months in a row, finally ticked up this month.

"Things seem to be improving," said Tracy Mullin, chief executive of the National Retail Federation, the sector's trade group.
"We will have a solid holiday season, but not a spectacular one."
To be sure, consumer spending has slowed from the overall pace of the last few years -- when it grew right through the recession and then the weakest job-market recovery in recent decades.
Behind that unusually strong growth -- normally, spending falls, at least briefly, during a recession -- were the lowest benchmark interest rates since the late 50's and a surge in home refinancing.
Now, as interest rates continue to rise, sustained job growth will be necessary for Americans to pay the bills on their oversubscribed credit cards and keep the economy afloat.

Consumer spending has been on a roller-coaster ride this year.
Excluding vehicle sales, which have bounced around at the mercy of changing financial incentives by automakers, spending at retailers is back on an upward track.

So while consumer spending may well slow in the final three months of the year from the torrid pace of the third quarter, when it increased 4.6 percent after adjusting for inflation, it is not likely to wilt.
"The gas shock is pretty much behind us," said Robert Mellman, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, adding that the higher heating oil prices expected this winter would pack a much lighter punch because they will be largely confined to customers in the Northeast and upper Midwest.

Consumers usually say that they will buy about the same or a little less than the year before, explained Bill Hampel, chief economist of the Credit Union National Association.
Moreover, 17 percent of respondents said they would buy more -- the highest level since 2000.
"I don't see any lingering concerns," said Richard A. Feinberg, professor of consumer sciences and retailing at Purdue University.
"It will be a pretty solid holiday spending season for retailers."

Perhaps the more important question is how consumers will emerge from their holiday shopping into 2005, as rising interest rates can be expected to hinder spending by making the burden of increased debt harder to handle.
With interest rates still relatively low, debt is providing a significant boost to consumption.
The Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that 30-year fixed mortgage rates will average 5.9 percent this quarter, the same as over the summer.
It expects mortgage refinancing to reach $235 billion, about 10 percent more than during the summer.

And the appetite for credit seems unsated.
Consumer credit rose by 5.8 percent in September, according to the most recent data from the Federal Reserve, to more than $2.05 trillion.
Americans' propensity to spend more than they earn drove the personal savings rate last quarter to merely 0.4 percent of disposable income -- the lowest on record.
Yet only 38 percent of those responding to the survey by the consumer federation and the credit union association said they were concerned about meeting their consumer debts, down from 46 percent in 2003.

"If you offer people a free lunch, you shouldn't be surprised if they take it," Mr. Hampel said.
Eventually, though, rising interest rates will bring the days of debt-powered hyper-consumption to a close.
Real improvements in the number of jobs and in the level of wages will be needed to take debt's place.

As more teenagers demand one of the two basic surgical options -- banding, in which a silicone band is wrapped around the stomach to reduce its size, and its more famous but riskier predecessor, gastric bypass surgery -- there remains little research regarding their long-term effects.
"Unfortunately there aren't any national guidelines to go to," said Lorraine Olivero-Rivera, the medical director for the Center for Obesity Surgery at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.
"There is bone growth going on; they are not fully developed.
There are a lot of factors that need to be considered."
Though Ms. Olivero-Rivera urges teenagers and the parents to be cautious, she is supportive of surgery in extreme cases.

The number of overweight teenagers has tripled in the past two decades.
Fifteen percent of children age 12 to 19 are now overweight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
With the severe health effects of obesity well documented, many doctors say that for patients who have tried everything else, surgery is often the only course left.

She now weighs 175 pounds, and her goal is to loose 30 more pounds.

Bypass surgery involves not only shrinking the size of the stomach, but also rearranging the small intestines to control how many calories can be absorbed.
A patient will feel full, to the point of pain, after eating only a small amount of food, roughly two ounces.
While popular, the surgery has many risks.
Roughly one in 200 patients die.

For teenagers, who are still growing, there is particular concern about a loss of calcium, protein and general malnutrition.
Because patients eat so little, fewer than 1,200 calories a day, they need to take vitamin and mineral supplements for the rest of their lives.
And the surgery is expensive, costing more than $40,000.
The newer stomach-reduction procedure, called banding, is considered much safer, although the weight loss is more gradual.
And since it is reversible, some in the medical community claim it is a better alternative to the bypass surgery, especially in teenagers.
He is now working at the New York University Medical Center and has performed 13 operations on teenagers this year.
At $20,000 or more, the operation is much less expensive than bypass surgery.

Dr. Christine Whyte, a pediatric surgeon at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, said the hospital had recently begun offering surgery to teenagers and is trying to encourage the band as opposed to the bypass.
(The hospital has no firm cutoff age but typically operates only on those age 15 or older.)
There are possible complications with the band.
While the risk of death is much lower than with gastric bypass surgery, the band can slip up or down, which requires that it be reset.
It also requires periodic tightening.

And some doctors feel the band is not the sure thing that gastric bypass surgery is, because if patients eat certain foods, such as ice cream, they can essentially cheat and not lose weight.

All of the doctors said that it was critical that there be a detailed screening process for teenagers, including a psychological evaluation, to determine if the patient is ready for a serious operation that will forever alter how they eat.
In addition, doctors said follow-up visits with a nutritionist should be mandatory to ensure that patients maintain a proper dietary balance.
It is tragic that this surgery is in such high demand, particularly among the young, Dr. Whyte said.

Japan and China, which together have amassed nearly $900 billion in United States Treasury securities, have both slowed their buying sharply from the frenetic pace in February and March.
"There is an emerging consensus that banks around the world are moving to expand their reserves of euros at the expense of dollars," said Laidi Ashraf, chief currency analyst at MG Financial Group in New York.
The Bush administration has essentially condoned the dollar's decline.
At meetings with foreign ministers last week, the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, repeated the American mantra of support for a "strong dollar" but also for letting "market forces" determine exchange rates.

"Sell U.S., buy Europe," summed up Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, in a report last week.
Mr. Berner noted that investors have begun demanding higher yields for 10-year Treasury securities than for comparable European bonds, and he predicted that the spread would widen.
The question is whether those purchases will continue to slow or start to increase again as countries try to shore up the American currency to help maintain their own industries' competitiveness.
Japanese purchases of Treasury securities, which ballooned by about $100 billion from October 2003 to March of this year, have slowed sharply and actually declined slightly in September.

But Chinese officials, under prodding from the Bush administration, have repeatedly said they want to gradually relax their 10-year-old policy of locking its currency, the yuan, at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar.
Any move to a more flexible exchange rate for China would probably cause the dollar to drop in value and allow the Chinese central bank to stop buying United States debt securities.

Across the region, AIDS has reduced life expectancy to levels not seen since the 1800's.
In six sub-Saharan nations, the United Nations estimates, the average child born today will not live to 40.
Here in Swaziland, a kingdom about the size of New Jersey with one million people tucked into South Africa's northeast corner, two in five adults are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
Life expectancy now averages 34.4 years, the fourth lowest on earth.
By 2010, experts predict, it will be 30.
Epidemics typically single out the aged and young -- the weak, not those at society's core.
So what happens to a society when its fulcrum -- its mothers and fathers, teachers, nurses, farm workers, bookkeepers, cooks, clerks -- die in their prime?

Part of the answer lies in Lavumisa, where two visitors spent five weeks recently talking to more than 60 residents, following the terrible ripples that an unrestrained epidemic is sending through the community.

A Hard Life Made Harder

Baked by drought, blessed with a single paved street, a gas station, two liquor stores, two bars and a wretched crafts stand for tourists speeding from the adjacent South Africa border post, Lavumisa clings to Swaziland's lower rungs.
Life would be hard here, even without AIDS.
A mostly rainless decade has discouraged most farmers from planting maize, the staple crop, much less the cotton that once underpinned the local economy.
Many survive on homegrown chickens and pigs, donations from the World Food Program and the kindness of relatives who work across the border or in Swaziland's better-off cities.

In a way, one might not expect the hollowing out of Lavumisa's adult population to have much affected its minuscule economy.
Unemployment in Swaziland averages 34 percent.
There is no shortage of cheap labor to replace a fallen clerk or farm worker.
But the death rate is transforming businesses and the work force, in ways not easily visible.
Peter McIntyre, 66, is one of Lavumisa's real estate baron's and probably its biggest private employer, owner of a grocery store, a liquor store, the gas station and the Lavumisa Hotel.

Medical clinics are caught in a double squeeze, with mushrooming caseloads and a steadily sicker staff.
Visits to Lavumisa's one-room medical clinic have jumped by nearly a fifth since 2000.
At the regional health center in nearby Matsanjeni, home to the only doctor within at least 30 miles, outpatient visits have tripled since 1998.

At the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum, just south of Philadelphia, at least six birds arrived in old cardboard boxes and truck beds to be counted and catalogued before volunteers moved them to the Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research center in Newark, Del.
The birds were alive, but most were in critical condition, radiating a nauseating chemical odor and appearing at times in shock, said Gary M. Stolz of the Fish and Wildlife Service, who manages the Heinz refuge.

The stringent proscriptions on how long before and how soon after an operation patients can safely eat or drink was based on tradition, dogma and fear, not science.

Once subjected to rigorous scientific study, the longstanding limitations on food and drink before and after surgery were found to be unnecessary and even detrimental.
"Medicine has changed substantially in the last 15 years," Dr. Michael L. Pearl, a gynecological oncologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said.
"Now evidence-based medicine is the norm."
Dr. Pearl has been a leader in research that has changed medical thinking on how soon after surgery patients can safely be fed and what they can safely consume.
He and others have clearly demonstrated that waiting until a patient can pass gas or move his bowels is counterproductive, resulting in longer and more costly hospital stays and greater patient discomfort.

Many researchers have also studied the amount of time patients should refrain from eating before surgery.

Despite these new guidelines, most patients awaiting surgery are still being told "nothing by mouth after midnight," orders that can result in prolonged and distressing fasts, as long as 30 hours before the surgery finally occurs.
Others are being needlessly denied food or drink long after their operations, and not given anything my mouth until the medical personnel are certain their bowels are ready to function normally.

Fasting Beforehand

The big fear behind the original midnight proscription was that a patient under anesthesia might vomit and aspirate, with serious respiratory consequences, if anything remained in the stomach during surgery.
This may have been more likely before the advent of modern anesthetics and better methods of administering them.
Pulmonary aspiration is rare with modern anesthesia.
The revised guidelines from the anesthesia society permit clear liquids (water, clear tea, black coffee, carbonated beverages and fruit juice without pulp) two hours before scheduled surgery; breast milk four hours before; regular milk and infant formula or a light meal (like toast and clear liquids) six hours before, and a regular or heavy meal eight hours before.

In the article "Preoperative Fasting: Old Habits Die Hard, " published in The American Journal of Nursing three years after the anesthesia society changed its guidelines, two registered nurses -- Jeannette T. Crenshaw and Dr. Elizabeth H. Winslow -- reported that "our colleagues working in hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and across the country report that ordering nothing by mouth after midnight is still the rule rather than the exception."
The authors cited as explanations for this lag "the inconvenience of departing from traditional practice, the belief that longer fasts are better, the difficulty of individualizing fasting instructions, the concerns about changes in surgery schedules, the fear of litigation, the lack of concern about the adverse consequences of fasting, and the exaggerated concern about aspiration."
The consequences of prolonged fasting are not trivial.
Further, there been no increase in cases of aspiration at in the hospitals that use the more liberal guidelines.
Feeding Afterward

The traditionally long delays in feeding patients after surgery were prompted by a fear of complications, including postoperative nausea and vomiting, aspiration pneumonia and abdominal distension, Dr. Pearl said.

But, he said, studies show the bowel continues to function even in surgery; in only 1 percent to 2 percent of patients does it shut down temporarily.
Starting patients on so-called clear liquids like fruit juice and Jell-O often cause nausea, Dr. Pearl and his colleagues found, because they are too high in sugar.
"They typically go home in two and a half days."
The southbound side is notorious because it is where two truck lanes and three car lanes slim down to just three lanes in all and trucks are fed into the car lanes.
At all hours of the day or night, backups can stretch for miles to the north.
The problem is made worse because there is a rest stop on the southbound side, where the lanes come together.
On the northbound side, where the turnpike has three lanes up to Exit 8A, the problem stems from both congestion and lane jockeying by drivers anticipating the widening of the roadway.

Transportation officials said the governor's proposal to expand the roadway was spurred last month by Pennsylvania's decision to build a new interchange where the Pennsylvania Turnpike enters New Jersey and meets a spur from the New Jersey Turnpike.
That interchange is expected to funnel even more truck and automobile traffic onto the 52-year-old New Jersey Turnpike, along a booming corridor of warehouses and distribution centers that is already increasing traffic in the central New Jersey area.

"You have to think about the importance of this corridor to the state's economy, because it carries commuters and trucks from the port loaded with goods going to distribution centers for the whole region," the official said.
"You can not overstate its importance."

News of the expansion plan was greeted happily, though with some caution, by trucking industry officials and representatives of drivers' groups in the state.

Mounting an intervention that failed would tarnish the credibility of the European Central Bank, which has won praise for its steady stewardship of the euro, but is still a fledgling institution.
"They are concerned about getting in front of this freight train, which is dollar depreciation, and not being run over by it," said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank.

Mr. Trichet, a Frenchman who speaks fluent but formal English, has tried to talk down the euro -- a practice known as verbal intervention -- without much success.
Did he mean brutal, as in ruthless or cruel?

Whatever the case, the euro kept rising, and Mr. Trichet retreated to the phrase "not welcome," which is less open to interpretation.

One reason for the cooling could be heavy recent speculative buying, with people acquiring houses in hopes of a quick profit without making improvements to the homes.

The median price for existing single-family homes reached $191,000 last June, up from $170,000 in 2003; it settled at $187,000 in October, according to the most recent figures available from the agency.
Property held by speculators, now estimated to account for as much as 15 percent of sales, represents hidden inventory that could suddenly be put up for sale should the market sour.
The deceleration of prices expected next year -- the rise for 2004 is estimated at 6.9 percent -- reflects an almost certain continuation of increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, analysts said.
David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, predicts that rates on conventional 30-year mortgages will average 6.40 percent next year, up from the current 5.75 percent, and will reach 6.75 percent by the end of 2005.
He nevertheless projects that 1.87 million new homes will be built next year, only 4 percent fewer than the 1.95 million likely to be built this year.
That includes a record 1.6 million single-family homes.
Current prices are at record levels in relation to average incomes, so higher interest rates would almost certainly make purchasing a home harder for prospective buyers.

"Although more locations are now at greater risk of a home-price decline than a year or two ago, a sharp correction is unlikely unless the economy unexpectedly contracts," the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard reported in its annual appraisal.

Mr. Yun, the analyst for the Realtors' association, said in October, "Homeowners can expect $10,000 equity gain from home-price appreciation in 2005."
Increases in personal wealth from higher home values have significant effects on the economy at large.
Economists have estimated that each dollar increase in real estate assets generates 8 cents of additional spending that year while the same gain from stocks and bonds adds only 2 cents to spending.

The overall economic effect of a rise in home values next year could be muted, however, because fewer people are refinancing their mortgages as interest rates rise.
Over the last four years, falling rates have led homeowners to tap the equity in their homes while lowering their monthly payments, freeing up money to spend.
But the Mortgage Bankers Association of America predicts the volume of mortgage refinancings will slide almost 43 percent next year, to $680 billion from an estimated $1.19 trillion in 2004.
Even though more people than ever already own homes, economists say that several factors will work to keep the demand for houses robust.
Inventories of available housing are low, for example, because environmental and other constraints limit new supply in some of the hottest markets.
And immigration provides a steady source of new buyers, since immigrants rate owning a home as their top priority -- more so than the general population.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That could compensate somewhat for the fact that fewer first-time buyers can afford homes.
The housing affordability index for first-time buyers stood at 74.7 for the third quarter of this year, down from an average of 79.7 for 2001 to 2003, according to the office of housing oversight.
(By contrast, the index for all buyers remains relatively high -- 132.2 in October.
That suggests that a family with a median income had more than enough money to buy a median-price home.)
"We're going to see more moderate price appreciation" next year, said Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Harvard center.
"If you're buying a house now primarily for investment, you're probably going to be disappointed.
But if you're buying to live in it, though it's not riskless, in the long run you should be fine."
American exports, meanwhile, will not be spurred as much as most forecasters hope.
Because currencies' values are relative to one another, the lower the dollar gets, the higher the euro and yen rise.
As the currencies of Europe and Japan strengthen, the exports of these nations will become more expensive.
That could easily translate into slower growth in those already slow-growing regions -- and less money to buy our exports.

What's more, with the exception of agriculture, fewer American products are sold from our shores.
Increasingly, they are sold by American subsidiaries overseas.
While big American companies still export billions of dollars' worth of goods across the Atlantic, they sell three to five times as much from their European-based operations -- to countries in Europe.
A lower dollar won't have much effect on those sales.
The problem with the administration's devaluation policy is that it doesn't treat the root causes of America's economic imbalances.
Our need to borrow so much from abroad is caused by our enormous consumption and our anemic savings.
Today, Americans save just 0.2 percent of their disposable income, practically the lowest level in 45 years.
Since we have so little savings to finance capital investment, we borrow from savings pools abroad.
Our government, too, needs foreign creditors to invest in Treasury securities, to finance its escalating budget deficits.
Another trade issue not addressed by dollar devaluation: the need to sharpen our global competitiveness.
In an advanced economy like ours, price should be less of a selling point than the quality and sophistication of a product.
This isn't going to happen unless we improve the fundamentals underlying competitiveness -- our education system and labor-force skills.
A devalued dollar also does not lower health-care costs -- costs so high that they encourage American employers to move operations to countries where governments often pick up the insurance tab.

The dollar may well be overvalued now.
But rather than just talking the currency down, Washington should try to pursue a formal agreement with Europe, Japan and China that addresses not only currency realignments but also the domestic policy changes needed to back them up.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A model for this is the so-called Plaza Accord negotiated by the Reagan administration with Germany and Japan in 1985.
But rather than talking down the currency or letting it fall on its own, President Reagan's team got key trading partners to share the burden of adjusting policies to correct the imbalance.
If Washington negotiated a similar accord today, countries like China and Japan could slow the dollar's slide by revaluing their currencies.
The pact could also involve policy commitments to support the currency realignments.
For example, rather than just assert that economic growth will reduce our budget deficits, the Bush administration might postpone or trim permanent tax cuts.
It could also agree to partly privatize Social Security only after creating a plan to finance the $1 trillion to $2 trillion in transition costs without deepening the deficit.
It could announce measures to improve our export performance -- starting, perhaps, with more support for certain research and development programs and a plan to lower health-care premiums for employers by offering reinsurance for catastrophic-illness costs.
For their part, European nations could pledge to accelerate deregulation to further open their economies and become bigger importers.
And key countries could agree to intervene in currency markets to keep the dollar's decline gradual and orderly.
A great power does not debase its currency -- a currency around which most global commerce revolves.
It does not take its hand off the tiller, as if the market bears all responsibility for global financial stability.

But how much sanding is enough: a couple of days or a couple of weeks?
How smooth does smooth have to be?
In a large apartment, the difference could amount to tens of thousands of dollars and weeks of work.
Beware of low-ballers.
If one contractor bids more than 20 percent below the others, you have reason to be suspicious.
Has the low bidder really taken a good look at the drawings, or is he just winging it?
Is he so desperate for the work that he may not have enough money to carry it out?

Over the summer, I was seduced by a low-ball bid from a demolition man.

Some low bidders may count on compensating themselves for lost profits by charging unusually high prices for the inevitable changes.
When a hidden pipe turns up in a wall you want to knock down, it's going to cost you.
Do you want to switch from marble to tile in the bathroom?
It's going to hurt, even though the material may be less costly.

What you really want is a contractor who bothers to become thoroughly acquainted with your job at the outset.
How can you tell?
A bid that goes into great detail is a good sign.
Proposals that include quantities and unit prices are better than those that just say, "Plumbing: $10,000."
An attentive contractor will also ask probing questions and may well suggest ways to save money before the contract has been signed.
He may want a small fee for fine-tuning such suggestions.
That's O.K.
Spending a little extra money and time here can save a lot of both later on.
An impressive client list will put your mind at ease.
References alone mean next to nothing.
It's how you check them that counts.
Check not only for raves but also for the presence of repeat customers.
Look for gaps.

Once you have checked out the company, do the same for the team assigned to your job.
You are well advised to ask for references on the two key figures on your contracting team: the project manager, who is responsible for your job, and the construction supervisor, who is the day-to-day representative (the one who will be sitting in your kitchen with your keys in his pocket).
Imagine that person introducing himself to the head of your co-op board.

If you are audacious, you might also ask for the names of dissatisfied customers, to see if the problem was shoddy work or just poor chemistry.
All you really have to do is see the contractor's current work.
Visits to work sites are of limited use to amateurs.
Sure, a neat and organized site is a plus.
On the other hand, construction is supposed to be messy.

It would be more helpful to have your contractor arrange visits to several projects, each of them at least a couple of years old, to see how they are holding up.
(Or better yet, arrange your own visits through references or friends, since the contractor is likely to send you to only his best work.)
Are bathroom tiles loose?
Are the moldings cracking?
How about the paint job?
Any sign of leaks?
As long as I use an airtight contract, I am protected.
Contracts, including the impressive array of those available from the American Institute of Architects, offer substantial protection.
But they cannot guarantee a good working relationship any more than a prenuptial agreement ensures a happy marriage.
Instead of trying to nail down every contingency at the outset, which naturally sets up an adversarial relationship, pick someone you trust and will feel comfortable with talking through the rough spots.
Though performance clauses may sound appealing, they are hard to enforce and rarely have the desired effect, partly because they can cause contention in the working relationship.

It's a famous firm.
All my friends use it, so it must be good.
A big name does not guarantee good service, especially with interest rates so low that work is plentiful.
"All you get with a big company," said Enrico Bonetti, a New York architect, "is a guy in a suit."
It may be nice to have a marquee name, but what really matters is that the firm is experienced in your type of renovation: the size of your project and budget, and your kind of apartment building or house.
The company should also be well versed in the permit process, which paralyzes many jobs.
A crew of 30 skilled workers can't do much if they are locked out by the super.
Nor will it help for the work to be completed on time if the contractor has neglected to arrange for the proper inspections.
If I pick a licensed contractor, I can't go too far wrong.
By all means, look for a licensed contractor.
But don't be too impressed.
Six thousand licensed home improvement contractors work in New York City alone.
Aspiring contractors need only pass a 30-question test.
The paperwork you really care about is liability insurance coverage.
Ask prospective contractors to fax you a copy of their workers' compensation certificates, along with proof that they have adequate insurance; $1 million is average in the city.

Establishing that a contractor has basic competence is easy.
In New York City, you can check with the Consumer Affairs Department, www.nyc.gov/html/dca.
You can eliminate deadbeats and fly-by-nights by checking with the Better Business Bureau, www.bbb.org.
But what you really want is to search out someone you can trust.
To find such a person, you have to do the right homework, and then go with your instinct.

Its avant-garde bona fides were extensive.
Its tangled network of artistic undergrounds -- painters, Fluxites, poets, filmmakers, cartoonists, musicians and a haven for progressive politics -- dates back to the 1930's.
It received infusions of new blood from the punk music and hip-hop scenes, which fed directly into post-punk performance and graffiti art.
"East Village USA" does reasonable justice to this complex time and place.
The show is quite crowded, but then the East Village was never about optimum viewing conditions.
The presentation here is far from definitive, which means unjustifiable exclusions are likely to spring to the minds of all who spent much time in East Village galleries, or at Performance Space 122, the nerve center of its active performance scene.

In fact this show is really an outline, which may actually make it more manageable, if not completely satisfying.
Its best parts could be expanded into exhibitions of their own; its weaker ones are rife with period pieces.
Yet it does what New York museums should do more often: impose a selective curatorial intelligence on the art of the recent past, helping the present in numerous ways.

Dan Cameron, the museum's senior curator, has organized the efforts of 75 artists according to aesthetic sensibility and, to some extent, chronology.
The notable exception is also one of the show's high points, "Beehive," a film ballet by the painter Frank Moore, who died of AIDS in 2002, and the dancer Jim Self, a onetime soloist with Merce Cunningham.

With Moore's Caligari-like set of yellow and purple honeycomb and furry yellow and black bee costumes, and Mr. Self's brilliant choreography and dancing, this work spoofs early modernism and should be belatedly considered an East Village classic.
It is projected on the exhibition's final wall, where it holds its own against a long-established classic of the period, "Leer," by the redoubtable Eichelberger.

The contrast of pell-mell language and buzzing dancers is positively dizzying.

The larger picture is one of opulence, permission, extreme diversity and brains working overtime.
One is reminded that the East Village scene actually consisted of several scenes, which were not necessarily on aesthetic speaking terms with one another.
Still, it is interesting to be reminded of the connection between Mr. Greenblat's cheerful yet wise idealism and that of graffiti-influenced San Francisco artists like Chris Johanson.
Similarly, one suspects that Richard Hambleton, known for splashing Abstract Expressionist figures across tenement walls, didn't identify much with Mr. Koons, who showed his bronze casts of aquatic equipment, including the inflatable lifeboat on view here, at a gallery called International With Monument (in honor of Vladimir Tatlin, if I recall correctly).
Along with Haim Steinbach, Ashley Bickerton and Meyer Vaisman (an owner of I.W.M.
), Mr. Koons took appropriation art into three dimensions under the banner of Neo-Geo, with Mr. Halley and his brash fluorescent paintings marching in step.
David McDermott and Peter McGough were known for swanning about the neighborhood in permanent Victorian flâneur drag.
But they also created "A Friend of Dorothy," a Neo-Geoesque masterpiece that splays across a bright yellow field the various profanities and euphemisms for homosexual in curling 19th-century letters, in shades of red and green.

As Mr. Cameron indicates in his introductory wall text (and his action-packed catalog essay), history moved fast during this period.
After a fanfare of paintings by Haring, Wong and Mr. Taaffe, so does his show, although some of the bases covered are more interesting than others.
Graffiti art retains much of its surface rawness, as does "Death Valley 69," a seven-minute film by Richard Kern, Judith Barry and Sonic Youth that careers among punk music video, political protest and a slasher chick played ably by the performance artist Lydia Lunch, switchblade in hand.

Also prsent are works by the members of CoLab, the collective whose legendary "Times Square Show" of 1980 was another of the East Village art scene's genesis points.
Here, Kiki Smith's 1985 "Speak to Yourself," silver-stained wood stock with a white enamel bowl trailing white gauze, anticipates the work of both Cady Noland and Sarah Lucas.
The scene's sweeter, more Romantic tendencies aren't holding up too well, although it is great to see David Sandlin's mural-size, neon-hued "Temptation Beneath the Pulaski Subway" and Lankton's delicately sewn sculpture of an acrobat doing a backbend.

The Neo-Geo medley is, object-wise, the show's strongest moment, along with works by Wojnarowicz, Paul Thek and Arch Connelly in a gallery devoted to artists who died of AIDS.
The show comes most irresistibly to life, and into the present, on the final wall, where performance reigns.
Along with the Eichelberger's "Leer" and the Moore-Self "Beehive" ballet, one can see Klaus Nomi, Karen Finley, John Kelly and Ann Magnuson in action.
Meanwhile in an upstairs gallery, photographs by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, Patrick McMullen and Dona Ann McAdams, the official photographer at P.S.

In fact, none of these approaches are likely to provide anything close to a perfect hedge, eliminating all risk of loss.
And while the options available to nervous homeowners are growing in number and sophistication, some advisers warn that they may provide minimal protection from the vicissitudes of the real estate market.

But other, simpler strategies may help you prepare for a softening of the market, they add.
One is to avoid variable-rate mortgages before any serious increase in interest rates -- an event regarded as a possible trigger for a reversal in home prices.
Macro Securities hopes to list its instruments in Chicago before such a reversal, but the exchange's announcement this month was short on details, like a starting date.
The minimum investment for the securities and the amount of leverage built into them are also not yet known.
A one-percentage-point move in the index, he said, may produce a change of two percent or three percent in the value of the securities.

An important feature of the Macro securities, he said, is that they will come in twos -- one moving in tandem with the index and the other in the opposite direction.
Having a single index fund would require a hedger to sell short, raising the theoretical prospect of an infinite loss.
(That could happen only if housing prices rose to infinity -- not a far-fetched idea to many people who are looking to buy a co-op in Manhattan.)

Another set of derivative products linked to home prices was introduced in October by HedgeStreet, which specializes in online trading of pint-sized contracts it calls "hedgelets."
Each is a yes-or-no wager that a housing index will be in a certain range on a given date within three months.
After that period, the contracts expire, and losing bets are worthless.

There are three residential property bets, representing percentage moves in an index whose level may be higher, lower or even with the recent trend in home price movements, for each of six cities: New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego.
But the value of each contract is a paltry $10, and they are infrequently traded, at best, so unless you live in a matchbox, it would be difficult -- and very expensive -- to buy enough of them to provide a practical hedge.

"With a combination of these two products, you can hedge out very aggressive short-term movements as well as longer-term movements," Mr. Andersson said.

Mr. Shiller says his approach to defending against price declines is meant to be useful even for people with modest incomes.
"We're looking for a vehicle with widespread acceptance," he said.
The device of two separate funds is one way to gain it, in his opinion.
"It means there is no loss beyond the initial outlay, no margin calls," he said.

That may not be true if leverage is built into the instruments, as Mr. Shiller envisions.
But homeowners looking for further protection may consider borrowing against their equity, knowing that it will rise enough to make up any decrease in the fund's value, he said.
Should home prices fall, the value of the fund that is inversely correlated to the housing market will rise, mitigating the loss.
"Volatile markets are increasingly becoming a part of our lives," Mr. Shiller added.
"The home market itself is becoming more volatile.
We're in the biggest real estate bubble in history, I believe.

"We haven't seen a swing down yet, but it could be coming," he warned.
"There are people with big houses and big mortgages who are going to feel the pinch."
The culprit in a downturn, he believes, will be big mortgages, more than big houses.
Variable-rate mortgages, in particular, could be a problem.

When interest rates are low, buyers can afford more house for the same monthly payment, said Mr. Golub, who himself is a renter in Manhattan.
He said that any holder of a variable-rate mortgage must understand that "if interest rates drop, the house is worth more to me, and vice versa; if rates rise, I'm toast."
Burned on both sides, too, because the higher mortgage payments tend to depress home prices.
"You get hit with a double whammy," he said.
"The cost of carrying goes up and the value goes down."
Over the previous 15 years, the two rose more or less in tandem, with one outpacing the other for a while before the pattern reversed.

Mr. Golub says he expects home prices to hold up until mortgage rates rise further, so there is time for homeowners to prepare.
His advice is to "lock down that fixed-rate mortgage."
As for the hedging vehicles being offered, he has doubts about their utility for most current and prospective homeowners.
"The adviser who would sell them won't be able to understand them," he said.
"They're the kind of thing you see pushed at the top of a market."
For someone considering buying a home now, "the smart thing to do is rent," he said.
"It probably does not make sense for someone who owns a home and plans to stay there to sell it and rent it back," he added.
"But what probably makes sense is for that first-time homebuyer or guy planning to retire to Florida to rent instead of buy."
